  "transcript": "in developed countries on average we have gotten ten centimeters taller but almost all of them involve nutrition namely the increase of dairy and meat from seventy one million tons to three hundred and ten million tons and we know that globally we are getting richer and as the middle class is on the rise so is our global population from seven billion of us today to nine point seven billion by two thousand and fifty which means that by two thousand and fifty we are going to need at least seventy percent more protein than what is available to humankind today and the latest prediction of the un puts that population number by the end of this century at eleven billion which means that we are going to need a lot more protein this challenge is staggering so much so that recently a team at anglia ruskin global sustainability institute suggested that if we don 't change our global policies and food our societies might actually collapse in the next thirty years our global marine life has been slashed in half and another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species such as swordfish and bluefin tuna over ninety percent has disappeared since even with the we might face total collapse our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population so how do we fix this what 's the world going to look but it 's not realistic and it 's impossibly hard to mandate globally people are eating animal protein whether we like it or not failing to meet demands the world health organization recently reported that eight hundred million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage is due to that same growing global population and the declining access to resources like water energy and land and we are running dangerously low on natural resources we must do better and there is a solution and that solution lies in aquaculture as the great ocean hero jacques cousteau once said we must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters that 's what civilization is all about farming instead of hunting and why is it that we keep hearing phrases like and we don 't know what pollution it encounters it prevents heart disease it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like cow is cow sheep is sheep pig 's pig and poultry pretty much sums it up and then there 's five hundred species of fish being farmed currently not that western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves but that 's beside that point and you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that 's good for us good for the planet and good for the fish i know i sound fish obsessed we were inspired by sylvia earle who won the ted prize in two thousand and nine we actually met on mission blue i in the galapagos we fell in love got married and we came away really inspired thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation something that was meant to last that could make a real difference and something that we could do together we got to a meeting at conservation international where the director general of worldfish was talking about aquaculture asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture we were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn 't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it to talk about stats every single fishing vessel combined small and large across the globe together produce about sixty five million tons of wild caught seafood for human consumption but now this is going to go up it needs to come from farming and talk about farming for farming you need resources as a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive so does an animal experts agree that it 's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet we just don 't have enough feed or water and we can 't keep cutting down rain forests for it and fresh water we need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet and now let 's compare that with fish farming and why is that well that it swims in it but it hardly drinks it fish are the most aside from how much we 've learned since for example on top of that sixty five million tons that 's annually caught for human consumption there 's an additional thirty million tons caught for animal feed this is madness sixty five percent of these fisheries globally are badly managed some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it it 's destroying our oceans the worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it recently an article came out of stanford saying that if fifty percent of the world 's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal our oceans would be saved now think about that for a minute now we know and it underlines how interconnected aquaculture deforestation climate change food security and so on blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on and we understand where these choices come from but this is not the right approach it 's not healthy have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean of course not now fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to but it 's had a really bad reputation there how blessed were the days when we could just enjoy food that was on our plate whatever it was once you know you know you can 't go back it 's not fun we really need a transparent food system that we can trust that produces healthy food but the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better we can now farm fish without any of these issues i think of agriculture before the green revolution we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution micro algae healthy for the people healthy for the fish healthy for the planet microbes for example can be a perfect alternative for high grade fish meal at scale think of fly fishing and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed and you don 't need to cut down rain forests for it and microbes and insects are actually net water producers this revolution is starting as we speak it just needs scale natural conditions creating happy fish i imagine for example a closed system delicious fish with little or no effluent almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint system where you grow up to ten species next to each other off of each other mimicking nature you need very little feed very little footprint i think of seaweed growing off the effluent of fish for example there from alternatives to battle disease so we don 't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore to automated feeders so we can save on feed and create less pollution software systems that gather data across farms so we can improve farm practices there so somebody needs to connect the dots and give these and that 's what we need to be working on together with a holistic view across the value chain connecting all these things across the globe alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable but not as far fetched as you might think it 's possible it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life we need to have a meal that we can trust live long lives people prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about we 're all the same the day will come where people will realize no demand farmed fish on their plate that 's farmed well and that 's farmed healthy you can help who raised it and what did it eat information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available ask for detail thank you"
