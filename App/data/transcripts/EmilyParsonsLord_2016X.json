  "transcript": "what do you imagine most people think about either empty space or clear blue sky or sometimes trees dancing in the wind drawing diagrams of but really we tend not to think about the air that much at all we notice it mostly it 's even inside us it 's so easily forgotten i 'm interested in how we imagine it how we experience it and how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality through breathing and we 're all doing it right now actually why don 't we all right now together take one big collective seventeen breaths per minute of the five hundred and just for you now that 's equivalent to about eighteen olympic sized swimming pools it 's simultaneously as small as our breathing and as big as the planet and maybe it doesn 't matter so that it can include things like how it feels on your skin and in your lungs and how your voice sounds as it passes through it i think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air this is a work i made in two thousand and it 's called different kinds of air a plant 's diary where i was recreating the air from different eras in earth 's evolution and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me so drastically different but atmospheric scientists will look for traces in the air chemistry in geology and they 'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it such that they can pretty much form a recipe for the air at different times then i come in as the artist and take that recipe and recreate it using the component gases but also the air that can influence how life will evolve like carboniferous air so for the first time in the history of life lignin evolves that 's the hard stuff that trees are made of so trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time and they get really big bigger and bigger and pepper the earth and this rich air supports massive insects huge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about sixty five centimeters to breathe it 's really good for hangovers just before the dinosaurs evolve it 's a really short time period geologically to two hundred thousand years really quick this is the greatest extinction event in earth 's history even bigger than when the dinosaurs died out that a lot of scientists agree comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes and a runaway greenhouse effect but it 's ok to just have a breath it 's really calming it 's quite warm and it has a flavor a little bit like like soda water it has that kind of spritz quite pleasant with all this thinking about air of the past it 's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future i discovered this that means that it doesn 't occur anywhere in well this air is a really stable molecule so that 's about twelve to it 's so heavy in fact that when you breathe it in whatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well so they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor air that operates quite a lot like a liquid but it 's also the most potent greenhouse gas that has ever been tested and it has that longevity of twelve to sixteen generations so this ethical confrontation is really central to my work it has another quite it changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically so when we start to think ooh it 's still there a bit when we think about climate change we probably don 't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes or funny voices the images that more readily come to mind are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs but perhaps it 's time we start thinking about climate change on the same visceral level that we experience the air climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule the breath it 's so it may not support the kind of life that we 'd recognize but it will because even though it 's invisible humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air"
