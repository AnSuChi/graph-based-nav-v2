  "transcript": "and i was taking care of people who were dying and their families in the south side of chicago and i was observing what happened to people and their families over the course of their terminal illness unlike this and the daughter 's husband he also was so here i get this call from this random guy that 's having an experience that 's being influenced by people at some social distance and second it was not restricted to pairs of people and then i realized that these individuals would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby and fact these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties and that in fact these connections were vast i social networks are these intricate things of beauty and they 're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous in fact that one has to ask what purpose they serve i mean how do they form how do they operate and how do they effect us so this is a slide of some of our initial results it 's two thousand two hundred people in the year two thousand every dot is a person so bigger dots are bigger people in addition if your body size if your bmi your body mass index is above thirty if you 're clinically obese we also colored the dots yellow but the visual complexity is still very high it 's not obvious exactly what so we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters this here shows on the y axis the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and on the x axis and the next bar over the it causes you to gain weight a kind of induction a kind of spread from person to person another possibility very obvious is homophily or birds of a feather flock together here i form my tie to you because you and i share a similar body size and the last possibility is what is known as confounding because it confounds our ability to figure out what 's going on and here the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain nor that i preferentially form a tie with you because you and i but rather that we share a common exposure to something like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time it increases your risk of obesity by about fifty seven percent in the same given time period there can be many mechanisms for this effect one possibility is that your friends say to you something like you know they adopt a behavior that spreads to you like they say let 's go have muffins and beer which is a terrible combination you adopt that combination and then you start gaining weight like them i think the headline in the new york times was are you packing it on blame your fat friends perhaps you are to blame and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america and a kind of self serving not my responsibility kind of phenomenon now i want to be very clear we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all all our next questions was could we actually visualize this spread was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure the architecture of the ties was changing across time in addition because obesity is not lots of people are doing things at the same time and i 'm about to show you a thirty second video animation that took me and james five years of our lives to do friendings and defriendings a lot of complexity a lot is happening just in this 30 year period that includes the obesity epidemic and by the end you 're going to see clusters of obese and non obese individuals within changed the way i see things it moves things flow within it it has a kind of consistency people can die but it doesn 't die it still persists and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time and so i came to see these kinds of social networks as living things and divorce which can spread and altruism and eventually we became interested in emotions now but others can read them and not only can they 're a kind of primitive form of communication i was giving this talk recently in new york city when you 're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you and you just instinctively smile back and they looked at me and said we don 't do that in new york city and i said everywhere else in the world that 's normal human behavior and in fact emotional contagion can be broader still like we could have punctuated the question that we wanted to ask was could emotion spread in a more sustained way maybe there 's a kind of below the surface quiet maybe in again a social network but now we color the people yellow if they 're happy and blue if they 're sad and green in between and if you look at this image you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people again spreading to three degrees of separation and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network there 's a middle and an edge to this so to invoke another metaphor if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity i 'm connected to you and you to her on out endlessly into the distance this and it has patches on it happy and unhappy patches and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch so this work with emotions which are so fundamental then got us to thinking about maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes but and notice first of all so to understand this though we need to dissect but that 's not the case with real networks compare node b in those two individuals have different of friends that 's very obvious we all know that but a 's friends all know each other and b 's friends do not so the friend of a friend of a 's is back again a friend of a this is known as transitivity in networks and finally compare nodes c and d c and d both have six friends if you talk to them and you said what is your social life like they would say i 've got six friends that 's my social experience but now we with a bird 's eye view looking at this network can see that they occupy very different and i can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network would you rather be c or d you 'd rather be d on and now who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip not about you was spreading through the network but we also found some non obvious things for instance forty seven percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes and we so whether you find how does this help us well the argument i 'd like to make is that networks have value they are a kind of social new properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks and these properties and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way on the left and you get graphite which is soft and dark and those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness do not reside in the carbon atoms they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms or at least arise because of the interconnections between the carbon atoms and so it is not just what 's happening to these people whether they 're losing weight or gaining weight or becoming rich or becoming poor or becoming happy or not becoming happy that affects us it 's also the actual architecture of the ties around us our experience of the world depends on the actual structure of the networks in which we 're residing and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow through the network the reason i think that this is the case is that human beings assemble themselves and form a kind of superorganism now a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to and by studying the collective example a hive of bees that 's finding a new nesting site or a flock of birds that 's evading a predator or a flock of birds that 's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the pacific or superorganisms have properties that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals i think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena like crime and warfare and economic phenomena like bank runs and market i think we form social networks because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs so the spread of good and valuable things is required to sustain and nourish social networks because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness and what i think the world needs now is more connections"
