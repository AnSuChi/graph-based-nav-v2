  "transcript": "many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn 't have been driving you were but you felt you could drive a few more miles or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere does this sound familiar to you now in those situations wouldn 't it be great if there was a button on your dashboard that you could push and the car would get you home safely now that 's been the promise and it 's been the dream since at least one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine when general motors showcased this idea at their futurama booth at the world 's fair now it 's been one of those dreams that 's always seemed about twenty years in the future clearly establishing that it 's legal for them to test it on the roads in and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in vegas laughter now in my lab at stanford we 've been working on autonomous cars too but with a slightly different spin on things why would we want to do such a thing well there 's two really good reasons for this first if you 're like me and the other seventy percent of the population who know that we you understand that 's a very high bar there 's another reason as well just like race car drivers can use all of the friction between the tire and the road all of the car 's capabilities to go as fast as possible we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can now you may push the car to the limits not because you 're driving too fast but because you 've hit an icy patch of road we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided i have a passion for racing although maybe not at the level that you 're currently expecting one of the things that we 've developed in the lab we 've developed several vehicles is what we believe is the world 's first autonomously drifting car it 's another one of those categories where maybe there 's not a lot of competition changing surfaces never spinning out gone around thunderhill raceway park in the sun the wind and the rain and navigated the one hundred and fifty three turns and twelve point four miles of the pikes peak hill climb route in colorado with nobody at the wheel i guess it goes without saying that we 've had a lot of fun doing this there 's something we have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers and we discovered their human counterparts are amazing and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amazingly fast line without the benefit of an algorithm that compares the trade off between going as fast as possible in this corner and shaving a little bit of time off of the straight over here not only that they 're able to do it lap after lap after lap they 're able to go out and consistently do pushing the car to the limits every single time it 's extraordinary you put them in a new car and after a few laps they 've found the fastest line in that car and they 're off to the races it really makes you think we 'd love to know what 's going on inside their brain so as researchers that 's what we decided to find out but also the race car driver to try to get a glimpse into what was going on in their head as they were doing this now this is dr lene harbott applying electrodes to the head of john morton and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research she 's putting electrodes on his however neuroscientists have identified certain patterns that let us tease out some very important aspects of this for instance the resting brain tends to generate a lot of alpha waves in contrast now we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the and as the road falls away you realize it was actually the top of a tree life is way too short so here you see john on the track he 's going up the hill oh somebody liked that and you can see actually his mental workload and then he has to turn left and down you can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity but what 's really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental workload doesn 't dramatic maneuver to correct it and no change whatsoever in the mental workload not a challenging task they are things that they have simply learned to do it requires very little mental workload for them to perform these amazing feats and their actions are fantastic this is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation now this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles we 've started to ask the question can we make them a little less algorithmic and a little more intuitive can we take this reflexive action that we see from the very best race car drivers introduce it to our cars but it 's made us think a little bit more deeply as well do we want something more from our car than to simply be a chauffeur do we want our car to perhaps be a partner someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we 're all capable of so as we move forward into this technological future i want you to just pause and think of that for a moment and as we think about that let 's take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind thank you"
