  "transcript": "please don 't go and download any of the viruses that i show you some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like and i thought i 'd give you a quick insight into my career so far this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power utilities and infrastructure right now every second eight new users are joining the internet we will see thirty thousand new just to kind of tear down a myth here lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus it 's because you went to a porn site right well actually statistically speaking if you only visit porn sites you 're safer people normally write that down by the way actually about eighty percent of these are small business websites getting infected today 's but actually today cybercriminals are wonderfully professional and organized in fact they have product adverts check out this one i found man so you 're here for one reason and that reason is because you need your business competitors rivals haters or whatever the reason is or who they are to go down well you my friend you 've came to the right place well they will not only that we are providing a service or scheduled attack starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites to ten to fifty dollars per hour now i did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website turns out that 's not cool this testing platform which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world fee they can upload it and make sure everything is good but it goes further cybercriminals now have crime packs with business intelligence reporting dashboards this is the market leader it comes with video setup routines and what i 've got here is two systems an which you might recognize from home or work now normally these would be on different sides of the of the planet or of the internet but i 've put them side by side because it makes things much more interesting maybe some of you have received an email that says something like hi now there are many ways you can get infected i want to show you a couple of my favorites this is a little usb key now how do you get a usb key to run in a business well you could try looking really cute so let 's have a look here on my victim computer what i 'm going to do after a couple of seconds things start to happen on the computer on their own usually a bad sign but i 've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring so this is writing out the malicious code and a few seconds later get some interesting new text now we can access your documents your data you can turn on the webcam that can be very embarrassing or just to really prove a point we can launch programs like my personal favorite the windows what i 'm going to do is open up a website that i wrote and it 's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website many of you will have used something a bit like this before unfortunately when this was implemented the developer was slightly inebriated called evil hacker so i 'm going to submit this post and then on my victim computer i 'm going to open up the web browser and browse to my website i get redirected that website address at the top there which you can just about see the browser crashes as it hits one of we really should clean that up what 's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access when the scan finishes they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses you have to register the product now i liked it better when viruses were free chasing two hundred and fifty thousand pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line you 'll note here so i want to talk to you briefly about a group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found and this is a rare treat in our job so here we have a couple of documents which our cybercriminals had uploaded to a cloud service kind of like dropbox or skydrive like many of you might use at the top you 'll notice a section of source code what this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message every day telling them how much money they 'd made that day so kind of cybercriminal billings report if you will if you look closely you 'll notice a series of what are russian telephone numbers now that 's obviously interesting because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals highlighted in red in the other section of source code is this bit leded so let 's take this a little further there are a few other interesting pieces the cybercriminals had uploaded lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference an interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones is that when you take a photo it embeds gps data about where that photo was taken obviously for and i 've noticed that about sixty percent but we 're happy to give away our gps coordinates to plus or minus fifteen meters we then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool we used google using the email address the telephone number and the gps data on the left you see an advert for a bmw that one of our cybercriminals is selling on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens one of these was more stereotypical for me a little more searching and here 's our cybercriminal imagine imagine what you could find about each of the people in this room a bit more searching through the profile and there 's a photo of their office they were working on the third floor and you can also see some photos from his business companion where he has a taste in a certain kind of image it but this is where our investigation starts to slow down and herein is the greatest lesson of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now our friends our families and our colleagues colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things this is mobsoft one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned and an interesting thing about mobsoft is the 50 percent owner of this posted a job advert and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers and maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals and it 's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really really insecure 27 page report at that link we had photos of the cybercriminals even christmas party when they were out on an outing that 's right cybercriminals do have christmas parties as it turns out now you 're probably wondering what happened to these guys let me come back to that in just a minute i and it 's relevant because it applies to us as a ted audience this is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets trying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks you do it every time you take out your iphone or your blackberry and connect but what you might not know so i ran a little scan i was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals okay so you can see a list of wireless networks tedattendees sophos visitors sansemea companies i work with loganwifi that 's in boston hiltonlondon so let 's make this a little bit more interesting let 's talk about you this isn 't an exact science but it gets pretty accurate seven hundred and sixty one of you i could identify i know where you live and i should mention as well that some of you do use your names james so something for you to think about as we adopt these new applications and mobile devices as we play with these shiny new toys how much are we trading off convenience for privacy and security next time you install something look at the settings and ask is this information that i want to share would someone be able to abuse it you see technology 's changing at a staggering rate and that two hundred and fifty thousand pieces of malware won 't stay the same for long there 's a very concerning trend that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more know how to use technology fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers we also need to think about the legal issues in this area the cybercriminals i talked about despite theft of millions of dollars actually still haven 't been arrested and at this point possibly never will most laws are national in their implementation despite cybercrime conventions where the internet is borderless and international which makes this area exceptionally challenging from a legal perspective my biggest ask is this you see you 're going to leave here and you 're going to see some astonishing stories in the news you 're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying scary things however ninety nine percent of it works because people fail to do so my ask is this apply them the internet is a fantastic resource for business for political expression for art and for learning help me and the security community thank you"
