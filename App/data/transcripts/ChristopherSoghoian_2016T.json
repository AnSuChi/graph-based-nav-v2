  "transcript": "in the spring of two thousand and sixteen a legal battle between apple and the federal bureau of investigation captured the world 's attention apple has built security features into its mobile products which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner that means that criminals hackers but governments are not so happy you see apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business apple has tried to make surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors there are really two smartphone ios and android ios is made by apple android is made by google apple has spent a lot of time and money to make sure that its products are as secure as possible and text messages sent from one apple customer to another apple customer are encrypted by default without the user having to take any actions what this means is that if the police seize an iphone and it has a password they 'll have a difficult time getting any data off of it if they can do it at all in contrast the security of android just really isn 't as good android phones or at least most of the android phones that have been sold to consumers do not encrypt data stored on the device by default and the built in text messaging app in android does not use encryption chances are they 'll be able to get all the data they want off of that device two smartphones and one that doesn a seller of luxury goods it dominates the high end of the market and we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that but not everyone can afford an iphone that 's where android really really dominates at the middle and low end of the market smartphones for the billion and a half people who cannot or will not spend but the dominance of android has led to what i call the digital security divide that is there is now increasingly a gap between the privacy and security of the rich who can afford devices that secure their data by default whose devices do very little to protect them so think of the average apple customer a banker a lawyer a doctor a politician these individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets that encrypt their calls text messages all the data on the device without them doing really anything to secure their information in contrast the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance in the united states where i live are more likely to be seen as suspicious and are more likely to be targeted by the state with surveillance but african americans are also disproportionately likely to use android devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance we must remember that surveillance is a tool it 's a tool used by those in power against those who have no power and while i think it 's absolutely great if the only people who can it 's a so the lack of default security in android is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable users who are depending on these devices modern social movements rely on technology from black lives matter to the arab spring to occupy wall street the organizers of these movements and the members of these movements and so naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones it 's quite possible that a future martin luther king or a mandela or a gandhi will have an iphone if we do nothing to ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state but future civil rights movements may be crushed before they ever reach their full potential saw recently in the press that mark zuckerberg from facebook covers over his camera and does something with his headphone mic jack so i wanted to ask you a personal question which is should we be doing that should we be covering these things putting a sticker over your web cam is probably the best thing you can do for your privacy in terms of bang for buck this is used by stalkers it 's used by governments and there 's obviously a sexual violence component to this which is that this kind of surveillance can be used most effectively against against women and other people who even if you think you have nothing to hide at the very least if you have teenagers in your in your lives make sure you put a sticker on on their camera and protect them"
