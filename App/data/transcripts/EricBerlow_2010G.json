  "transcript": "fresh out of the oven is complex but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated i 'm an ecologist and i study complexity i love complexity and i study that in the natural world the interconnectedness of species and this is what happens to that food web when it 's stocked with even though they eat them these effects were all unanticipated and yet we 're discovering they 're predictable so i want to share with you a couple key insights about complexity we 're learning from studying nature that maybe are applicable to other problems first is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just encourage you to ask questions you didn 't think of before for example you could plot the carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem or the interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in yosemite national park it 's actually less predictable than consider the entire system all the species all the links and from that place hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most the better chance you have of finding simple answers and it 's often different than the simple answer that you started with so let 's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u s government u s counterinsurgency strategy in afghanistan it was front page of the new york times a couple months ago clearly a complex problem well when i saw this in the front page of the times i thought great finally something i can relate to i can sink my teeth into this three degrees away from that node and eliminate three quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence within that sphere most of those nodes are not actionable like the harshness of the terrain and a very small minority are actual military actions most are and they fall into two broad categories transparent economic development and provisioning of services we 're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of complexity so for any problem the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity the better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most"
