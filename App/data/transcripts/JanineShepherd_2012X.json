  "transcript": "that was my bliss as a cross country skier and member of the australian ski team headed towards the winter olympics i on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates sunshine the smell of eucalypt and a dream life was good we 'd been on our bikes for around five and a half hours when we got to the part of the ride that i loved and that was the hills because i loved the hills and then everything went black where was i what was happening my body was consumed by pain been hit by a speeding utility truck with only ten minutes to go on the bike ride i had extensive and life threatening injuries i broke my i broke some bones in my feet my whole right side was ripped open filled with gravel my head was cut open across the front lifted back exposing the skull underneath i had head injures i had internal injuries i had massive blood loss in fact i lost about five liters of blood which is all someone my size would actually hold why would i want to go back to a body that was so stay with me we can do it we can do it together i knew if i didn 't return to my body i 'd have to leave this world forever it was the fight of my life and the internal bleeding stopped they said to my parents that the neck break was a stable fracture but the back was completely crushed the vertebra at l1 was like you 'd dropped a peanut they picked as much broken bone as they could that had lodged in my spinal cord they took out two of my broken i had a little and i thought great because i 'm going to the olympics but then the doctor came over to me and she said janine the operation was a success and we 've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could but the damage is permanent the central nervous system nerves there is no cure you 're what we call a partial paraplegic and you 'll have all of the injuries that go along with that have no feeling from the waist down and at most you might get ten or twenty percent return you it will be with calipers and a walking frame and then she said janine you 'll have to rethink everything you do in your life because you 're never going to be able to do the things you did before i was an athlete that 's all i knew that 's all i 'd done if i couldn 't do that then what could i do and the question i asked myself is if i couldn 't do that then who was i they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal i was lying on a thin hard spinal bed i had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and i saw my world through a mirror that was suspended above my head we didn 't know what each other looked like how amazing is that how often in life do you get to make friendships and our hopes for life after the spinal ward i remember one night one of the nurses came in jonathan with a whole lot of plastic straws and he said start threading them together well there wasn 't much else to do in the spinal ward so we did ok everybody hold on to your straws and he said now we 're all connected and as we held on and even lying paralyzed there were moments of incredible depth and richness of authenticity and connection that i had never experienced before and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward i remember dad pushing me outside in my and feeling the sun on my face for the first time i soaked it up and i thought how could i ever have taken this for granted but before i left hospital the head nurse had said to me janine i want you to be ready because when you get home something 's going to happen and i said you 're in a wheelchair that 's normal but you 're going to get home and realize how different life is and i got home and something happened and i wanted to give up all i wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the friends that were still in the spinal ward particularly maria maria was in a car accident and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic had no movement from the neck down they told me we 're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her i was worried i didn 't know how because maria always smiled albeit difficult to understand she never complained not and i realized and then i knew just like before that i had a choice i could keep and then i stopped asking why me and i started to ask why not me maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start i had never before thought of but now i was and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do in that uncertainty i was no longer tied to a set path and that realization sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast an airplane flew overhead they said well i have to get a friend to drive me because i can 't drive that a problem i made a booking and weeks later my friend chris and my mom drove me out to the airport all eighty pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast in a baggy pair of overalls i can tell you i did not look like the ideal candidate to get a pilot 's license i 'm holding on to the counter because i can 't stand i said hi i 'm here for a flying get me out on the tarmac and there was this red white and blue airplane it was beautiful they had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit they sat me down there are buttons and dials everywhere i 'm going wow how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do andrew got in the front started the and said would you like to have a go at taxiing that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground i said no i can 't use my legs he went oh i said but i can use my hands and he said ok and the wheels lifted up off the and andrew said to me as we got over the training area you see that mountain over there and i said yeah and he said well you take the controls and you fly towards that mountain i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun i knew right then that i was going to be a pilot didn 't know how on earth i 'd ever pass a medical and i practiced my walking as much as could and i went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to wiping but at least she always knew where i was and i spent every moment i could out at that flying school way out of my comfort zone all these young guys that wanted to be qantas pilots hop along me in first my plaster cast and then my steel brace my baggy overalls my bag of medication and catheters and my limp because now there was something inside that burned that far and little goals kept me going along the way and eventually i got my private pilot 's license and then i got my commercial pilot 's license and then i got my instructor rating just under eighteen months after i 'd left the spinal ward and i learned to fly upside down and became an aerobatics flying instructor laughter and mom and dad never been up but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited spirit that was unstoppable the philosopher lao tzu once said you become what you might be i now know that it wasn 't until i let go of who i thought i was it wasn 't until i let go of who i am is unchanged the pilot light inside of me just as it is in each and every one of us and then it no longer matters what you look like where you come from or what you do for a living all that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity because we are all connected and it 's time to join those up and to hang on and if we are to move towards our collective bliss it 's time we shed our focus on the physical and instead embrace the virtues of the heart so raise your straws if you 'll join me"
