  "transcript": "if i should have a daughter instead of mom she 's going to call me point b because that way she knows that no matter what happens at least she can always find her way and i 'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say oh i know that like the back of my hand but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air that cannot be fixed by band aids or poetry so the first time she realizes that wonder woman isn 't coming i 'll make sure she knows she doesn 't have to wear the cape all by herself because no matter believe me i 've tried just smelling for smoke so you can follow the trail back to a burning house so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire to see if you can save him but i know she will anyway so instead i 'll okay there 's a few that chocolate can 't fix but that 's what the rain boots are for rain will wash away everything if you let it i want her to look at the world through the underside of a glass bottom boat to look through a microscope at the galaxies that exist on the pinpoint of a human mind because that there 'll be days like this there 'll be days like this my momma said when you open your hands to catch and wind up with only blisters and bruises when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly and the very people you want to save are the ones standing on your cape because there 's nothing more beautiful than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline no matter how many times it 's sent lose some you will put the star in starting over and over and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life and yes on a scale from one to over trusting i am is a worrier and your poppa is a warrior and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes who never stops asking for more remember that good things come in threes and so do bad things but don 't when they slip war and hatred under your door and offer you handouts on street corners of cynicism and defeat you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother they can be about whatever you want technology entertainment design your family what you had for breakfast the only rule is don 't think too hard jean luc godard was right when he said that a good story has a beginning a middle and an end although not necessarily in that order which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool and i know that i have been waiting all week to tell this joke because he was out standing in his field i 'm sorry but there are plenty of things i have trouble understanding so i write poems to figure things out sometimes the only way i know how to work through something is by writing a poem sometimes i get to the end of the poem look back and go oh that 's what this is all about and sometimes i get to the end of the poem and haven 't solved anything but at least i have a new poem out of it spoken word poetry is the i tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn 't just want to sit on paper that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person when i was a freshman in high school i was a and i was underdeveloped and and despite my fear of ever being looked at for too long i was fascinated by the idea of spoken word poetry i felt that my two secret loves poetry and theater had come together had a baby packed with all the wisdom of a and i turned around to see this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd she was maybe eight feet tall and looked like she could beat me up with one hand but instead she just nodded at me and said felt that thanks and lightning struck i discovered this bar on manhattan 's lower east side that hosted a weekly poetry open mic and my bewildered but supportive parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that i could i was the youngest by at least a decade but somehow the poets at the bowery poetry club didn 't seem bothered by the 14 year old wandering about in fact they welcomed me and it was here listening to these poets share their stories that i learned that spoken word poetry didn 't have to be indignant it could be fun or painful or serious or silly the bowery poetry club became my classroom and my home and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well never mind the fact that i was fourteen they told me write about being fourteen i really felt that too now i can divide my spoken word journey into three steps step one was the moment i said i can i can do i love spoken word i will keep coming back week after week and step three began when i realized i didn 't have to write indignant poems if that 's not what i was there were things that were specific to me and the more that i focused on those things i use poetry to help me work through what i don 't understand but i show up to each new poem with a backpack full of everywhere else that i 've been i met a fellow poet who shared my belief in the magic of spoken word poetry phil kaye and i coincidentally also share the same last name educate and inspire we stayed full time students but in between we traveled performing and teaching and we saw over and over the way that spoken word poetry cracks open locks but it turns out sometimes poetry can be really scary so i came up with lists can write lists and the first list that i assign is ten things i know to be true you would discover it too if we all started sharing our lists out loud at a certain point you would realize that someone has the exact same thing or one thing very similar to something on your list and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours someone has something you 've never even heard of before fourth someone has something you thought you knew everything about but they 're introducing a new angle of looking at it and i tell people that this is where great stories start from these four intersections of what you 're passionate about and what others might be invested in a freshman named charlotte was not charlotte was very good at writing lists but she refused to write any poems miss she 'd say i 'm just not interesting i don 't have anything interesting to say so i assigned her list after list and one day i assigned the list ten things i should have learned by now number three on charlotte 's list was i should have learned not to crush on guys three times my age it 's kind of a long story and i said charlotte it sounds pretty interesting to me and the poem began anderson cooper is a gorgeous man did you see him on sixty minutes racing michael phelps in a pool nothing but swim trunks on diving in the water determined to beat this swimming champion after i know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem unfazed somebody once told me it 's like walking through life you protect yourself from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up but and yes that means catching all of those miseries and hurt but it also means that when beautiful amazing things just i use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and and actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them so that they can reinterpret and create something from it it 's not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form i 'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story i write musicals i make short films alongside my poems but i teach spoken word poetry because it 's accessible but everyone can communicate in some way and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from from plus spoken word poetry allows for immediate connection it 's not uncommon to feel like you 're alone or that nobody understands you but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers or your community who will listen plus now with youtube that connection 's not even limited to the room we 're in i 'm so lucky that there 's this archive of performances that i can share with my students it allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to once you 've figured this out it is tempting to keep writing the same poem or keep telling the same story over and over once you 've figured out that it will gain you applause it 's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself you have to grow and explore and take risks and challenge yourself and that even while those things are always and i don 't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three but i was very lucky with charlotte that i got to watch her journey unfold the way it did i watched her realize that by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she 's doing she can create poems that only charlotte and i 'm trying to tell stories only i can tell i spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story and i wondered if the best way was going to be a powerpoint a short film and i wondered whether i 'd get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out or not and i always thought that my beginning was at the bowery poetry club but it 's possible that it was much earlier in preparing for ted i discovered this diary page in an old journal i think december 54th was probably supposed to be 24th i would like to help others rediscover that wonder to want to engage with it to want to learn to want to share what they 've learned what they 've figured out to be true and what they 're still figuring out so the explosion formed a so every living animal human or plant that received direct contact with the rays from that sun was instantly turned to ash and what was left of the city soon followed the long lasting damage of nuclear radiation caused an entire city and its population to turn when i was born my mom says i looked around the whole hospital room with a stare that said this i 've done this before i was only five years old but i took my mom by the hand and told her don 't worry he 'll come back as a baby and yet for someone who 's apparently leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page so no matter that i have inhibitions to fill all my pockets i keep trying hoping that one day i 'll write a poem i can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit as the only proof i existed in the original story god told sarah she could do something impossible and but i see the impossible every day impossible is trying to connect in this world trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you knowing that while you 're speaking they aren 't just waiting for their turn to talk they hear you they feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it it 's what i strive for every time i open my mouth that impossible connection there 's this piece of wall in hiroshima that was completely burnt black by the radiation but on the front step a person who was sitting there blocked the rays from hitting the stone the only thing left now is a permanent shadow of positive light after the a bomb specialists said it would take seventy five years for the when i meet you in that moment i 'm no longer a part of your future i start quickly becoming part of your past but in that instant i get to share your present and you you get to share mine that is the greatest present of all so if you tell me i can do the impossible i i don 't know if i can change the world yet because i don 't know that much about it and i don 't know that much about reincarnation either but if you make me laugh hard enough sometimes i forget what century i 'm in this isn 't my first time here this isn 't my last time here these aren 't the last words i 'll share but just in case i 'm trying my hardest to get it right this time around thank you"
