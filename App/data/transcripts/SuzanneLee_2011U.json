  "transcript": "so as a fashion designer i 've always tended to think of materials something like this or this or maybe this and now i think of materials like this yeasts and other micro organisms which spin cellulose these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface and then while it 's still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar we stir this in until it 's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath we need to check that the temperature has cooled to below thirty degrees c and then we 're ready to add the we need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth and i use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it and actually in hot weather i can just grow it outside so this is my mini fabric farm after about three days the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid so this is telling us that the fermentation is in forming layers and on the right after ten and this is a static culture you don 't have to do anything to it you just literally watch it grow it doesn 't need light and when it 's ready to harvest you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold soapy water so what you 're left with depending on the recipe is something that 's either like a really light weight transparent paper and as it it will knit itself together forming seams i guess it also looks a little bit like human skin which intrigues me since it 's organic create organic and because of the of this kind of cellulose it just takes one and a really short one at that water resistant so if i was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today i would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water possibly a good performance piece but definitely not ideal for everyday wear what i 'm looking for is so what i want to do is say and while you 're at it just form it around this 3d shape and possibly in the future for but with synthetic we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium we could actually imagine growing consumable products so we only grow what we need there 's no waste finally at the end of use we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings what i 'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton leather or other textile materials but ultimately maybe it won 't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact we could for example imagine growing a lamp a chair a car so i part of the project 's still in process because this one is is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes"
