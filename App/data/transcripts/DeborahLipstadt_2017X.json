  "transcript": "i laughed best documented genocide in the world who could believe it didn 't happen well first of all the victims the survivors who have told us their harrowing stories old and be marched to the outskirts of the town to be shot and left dead in ditches or the poles who lived towns and villages around the death camps who watched day after day as the trains went in filled with people and came out empty the people who say we they say i didn 't have a choice i was forced to do it but nonetheless they say i did it think about it in not one war crimes trial since the end of world war ii has a perpetrator of any nationality having thought that through i decided and i moved on and two senior scholars two of we have a research idea that we think is perfect for you intrigued and flattered that they came to me with an idea and thought me worthy of it i asked what is it and they said holocaust denial the flat earth folks the and these two guys said yeah we 're intrigued what 's their objective how do they manage to get people to believe what they say so thinking if they thought it was worthwhile i would take a momentary diversion maybe a year maybe two three maybe even four in academic terms that 's momentary we work very slowly and i would look at them and i came up with a number of things two of which i 'd like to share with you today one they are the same nazis i didn 't see any ss like uniforms symbols on the wall sieg heil salutes none of that what i found instead were people parading as respectable academics what did they have they had an institute an institute for historical review they had a journal a slick journal a journal of historical review one filled with papers we are out to do one thing to revise mistakes in history and what did you find there the same adulation of hitler praise of the third anti semitism racism prejudice this is what intrigued me it was the other thing i found many of us have been taught to think there are facts and there are opinions dress them up as opinions maybe edgy opinions maybe sort of out of the box opinions but then if they 're opinions they should be part of the conversation and then they encroach on the facts i published my work the book was published denying the holocaust the growing assault on truth and memory it came out in many different countries including here and i was done with those folks and ready to move on i opened the letter and it informed me that david irving was bringing a libel suit against me in the united kingdom for calling him a holocaust denier david irving suing me who was david irving david irving was a writer of historical works most them about world war ii and virtually all of those works he hadn 't always been a holocaust denier but in the late ' 80s he embraced it with great vigor reason i laughed also was this was a man here was a man and i quote who said i 'm going to sink the battleship auschwitz here was a man who pointed to the number tattooed on a survivor 's arm and how much money have you made from having that number tattooed on your arm here was a man who said more people died in senator kennedy 's car at chappaquiddick than died in gas chambers at auschwitz that 's an american reference but you can look it up this was not a man who seemed at all ashamed or reticent about being a lots of my academic colleagues counseled me eh deborah just ignore it when i explained you can 't just ignore a libel suit they said who 's going to believe him anyway british law put the onus put the burden of proof on me in contrast to as it would have been in the united states and in many other countries on him to prove the falsehood and if he won by default he could then legitimately say my david irving version of the holocaust is a legitimate version was found to have libeled me when she called me a holocaust denier ipso facto i david irving am not a holocaust denier and what is that version there were no gas chambers there were no mass shootings hitler had nothing to do with any suffering that went on and the jews have made this all up and they 've done i couldn 't let that stand and ever face a survivor or a child of survivors i couldn 't let that stand and consider myself a responsible and for those of you who haven 't seen we showed a pattern in over twenty five different major instances not small things many of us in this audience write books are writing correct the mistakes but these always moved in the same direction but how did we win but in every we didn 't prove what happened we proved that what he said happened and by extension all deniers because he either quotes them or they get arguments from him long six year difficult lawsuit an american professor being dragged into a courtroom by a man that the court declared in its judgment what message does it have social media for all the gifts it has given us has also allowed the difference between facts established facts third of all extremism you may not see ku klux klan robes you may not see burning crosses you may not even hear outright white supremacist i 'm reminded of a new yorker cartoon a quiz but your opponent yelled more loudly than you did so he gets the point what can we do first of all we cannot be beguiled by rational we 've got to look underneath and we will find there the extremism second of all we must understand that truth is not relative we must go on the offensive not the defensive when someone makes an outrageous claim even though they may hold one of the highest offices in the land if not the world we must say to them where 's the proof where 's the evidence we must not treat it as if their lies are the same as the facts and as i said earlier truth is not relative many of us have grown up in the world of the academy and enlightened liberal thought where we 're taught everything is open to debate there are indisputable facts galileo taught it to us centuries ago even after being forced to recant by the vatican he came out and what is he reported to have said and yet it still moves elvis is not alive the job ahead of us the task ahead of us the challenge ahead of us is great we must act thank you very much"
