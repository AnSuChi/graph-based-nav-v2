  "transcript": "so there 's this thing called the and i 'm a designer i don 't like unintended consequences people hire me because they have consequences so and so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended i got called by an organization called robin hood to do a favor for them robin hood is based in a wonderful philanthropic organization that does what it says in the name they take from rich people give it to poor people in this case what they wanted to benefit was the new york city and in buildings that are like this one old buildings big buildings drafty buildings sometimes buildings that are in disrepair certainly buildings that could use a renovation robin hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way but what they realized was to fix the buildings would be so instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into in each of these buildings in as many buildings that they could and and what they came up with was the school library and they came up with this idea called initiative all the students have to pass through the library that 's where the books are that 's where the heart and soul of the school is so let 's fix these libraries so they did this wonderful thing where they brought in first ten then twenty then more architects each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was they trained special librarians then they called me up and they said could you make a little contribution i said sure what do you want me to do easy to do actually compared with architecture and being a librarian so so the basic idea was these would be new school libraries for new york schools and so the idea is that it 's a new thing a new idea that needs a new name what i wanted to do dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries the kind of places that everyone is bored with you don 't worry about that at all this is going to this new exciting thing think of it as a place where it is like do or it could be open wonder learn or it could be and i and then look at this it 's like the eye of the owl this is irresistible in my opinion but there 's even another idea option number three option number three was based actually on language it 's the idea that read is the past tense of read and they 're both spelled the same way so why don 't we call this place the red zone i 'm well red i really loved this idea and i somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and i don 't know but sometimes cleverness is more important and i thought this would be one of those instances so usually when i make these presentations i say there 's just one question and the question should be how can i thank you mike but in this case the question was more like um the premise of all this work was that kids were bored with old libraries musty old libraries they were tired of them these kids have never really seen a library the school libraries in these schools are really so dilapidated so the idea was just forget about giving it a new name just call it one last try a library mission accomplished there 's your logo so what 's interesting about this logo an unintended consequence was that it turned out that they didn 't really even need my design because you could type it any font you could write it by hand and when they started sending emails around they just would use shift and one they 'd get their own logo just right out of the thing so here 's the big rollout put it on both doors logo then i got a call from sure and he said the problem is that there 's a space between the shelf and the ceiling so that sounds like an architectural issue to me not a graphic design issue so i 'm go on and so actually i 've got all this space up there and i need something like a mural and i 'm like whoa you know i 'm a logo designer i 'm not diego rivera or something i 'm not a muralist and so he said but can 't you think of anything so i said what if we just took pictures of the kids in the just put them around the top of the thing and maybe that could work and my wife is a photographer and i said dorothy there 's no budget can you come to this school in east new york take these pictures she did and if you go in richard 's library which is one of the first that opened it has this glorious frieze of like the heroes of the school oversized looking down into the little dollhouse of the real library right and the kids were great hand selected by the principals and the librarian and i 'm like ok so then i think well it can 't be the same mural every time so and then she did another one but then we needed more help so i called an illustrator i knew named lynn pauley and lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids then i called a guy named charles wilkin at a place called automatic design he did these amazing collages we had rafael esquer do these great silhouettes he would work with the kids asking for words and then based on those prompts come up with this little delirious kind of constellation of silhouettes of things that are peter arkle interviewed the kids and had them talk about their favorite books and he put their testimony as a frieze up there brilliant illustrator did a whole series of things where he embedded books into the faces and characters and images and places that you find in the books and then even maira kalman did this amazing cryptic installation of objects and words that kind of go all around and will fascinate students for as long as it 's up there so this was really satisfying and basically my role here was reading let me know if you have any problem and they would go and install these it just was the greatest thing but the greatest thing actually was every once in a while i 'd get like an invitation in the mail made of construction paper and it would say you are invited to the opening of our new library say you 'd go to ps10 and you 'd go inside there 'd be balloons there 'd be a student ambassador there 'd be speeches that were read poetry that was written specifically and someone i 'm part of the team that designed this place nice work if you can get it so it was so satisfying going to these little openings despite the fact that i was kind of largely ignored or humiliated but it was it was actually fun going to the openings so i decided that i wanted to get the people in my office who had worked on these projects get the illustrators and photographers why don 't we rent a van and drive around the five boroughs of new york and see how many we could hit at one time and eventually there were going to be sixty of these libraries so we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day took possession of these places like their private stage upon which they were invited to mesmerize their students and bring the books to life and it was just this really exciting experience for all of us to actually see these things in action hey wait a second do you want to see how i turn off the lights i 'm like ok and she said i have this special way that i do and then she showed me what she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one and the last light she left on was the light that illuminated the kids ' faces and she said that 's the last light i turn off every night because i like to remind myself why i come to work i would like to take credit for and like to think i can think through the experience to that extent but i can 't i was just focused on a foot ahead of me as far as i could reach with my own hands instead way off in the distance was a librarian who was going to find they 've been happening for more than ten years now so those thank you very"
