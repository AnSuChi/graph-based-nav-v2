  "transcript": "i 'm passionate about making it about watching it about encouraging others to participate in it and i 'm also really passionate about creativity creativity for and i think you can find out things about your own personal physical signature your own cognitive habits and use that as a point of departure to misbehave beautifully and john travolta was big in those days grease saturday night fever and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me to start dancing my parents were very up for me going i had an opportunity an access to a local and i had an enlightened teacher so what she did was let me make up my own ballroom and latin american dances to teach to my peers and i guess what 's interesting is is that i am now obsessed with the technology of the body i think it 's the most technologically literate thing and i 'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them touch them think differently about things and it 's a collaborative process it 's something that i have to do with other people you know it 's a distributed cognitive process in a way i work often with but also more and more with economists anthropologists neuroscientists cognitive scientists people really who come from very different domains of expertise where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process and we 're all experts in physical thinking and we all know what that body is like in the real world so one of the aspects of physical thinking that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception the sense of my own body in the space you absolutely know that when you 're going to grab a cup or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it so we 're experts in physical thinking already we just don 't think about our bodies very much we only think about them when they go wrong so when but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking kinesthetic intelligence to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally i 'm not sure if this is going to be good or not i 'll just be doing it i this is catarina so this is not the type of choreography where i already have in mind what i 'm going to make where i 've fixed the routine in my head and i 'm just going to teach it to them and these so called empty vessels are just going to learn it that 's not the methodology at all that we work with but what 's important about it is how and i thought i 'd take something simple ted logo we can all see it it 's quite easy transformation of energy and i 'm going to place that outside in the real world so i absolutely see if i were to take that letter t and flatten it down on the floor maybe just off the floor all of a sudden i could do maybe something with my knee yeah so what i 'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is and it 's almost like i 'm offloading memory and they 're holding onto memory yeah and we 'll see what we come up with so just have a little watch about how they 're how they 're accessing this and what they 're doing and i 'm just going to take this letter so i have to get myself in the zone this space of t and flashing through it with some i 'm not remembering what i 'm doing i 'm just working on my task my task is this t going to watch it from the side what they 're doing is grasping aspects of that movement you can see the speed is extremely quick yeah i 'm not asking them to copy exactly they 're using the information that they receive to generate the beginnings of a phrase i can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they 're moving yeah they 're super quick right so i 've taken this aspect of ted and translated it into something that 's physical the arc of the movement the kinetic sense of the movement and use that for memory some work very much in specific detail they start with small little units and build it up okay you 've got something one more thing so they 're solving this problem for me having a little they have something and they 're going to hold on to it yeah one way of making that from there i 'm going to do a very different thing so so what they are are just pure lines so what i 'm thinking about is taking and i move them and i do that by suggesting things to them if then if then okay so here we go just grab this arm can you place that down into the floor so from there from there we 're both getting up we 're both getting up going in this direction going underneath almost get his head let me slow down here fancy having eight laughter fancy having eight hours with me in a day so maybe too much so here we go ready and just a little bit more here we go from that place separate face the front throw it into the audience whoom throw it into the audience again we 've got mental architecture we from the beginning can we do our phrases first and then that and we 're going to build something now organize it the phrases here we go with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me and this is a third method they 're starting it already and this is do a little mental dance a little or open and if you don 't want to do it you can watch them it 's up to you just for a second think about that word ted in front of you so it 's in mind and it 's there right in front of your mind what i 'd like you to do is transplant that outside into the real of the bottom if i asked you to reach out you don 't have to literally do it but in mind reach out to the top of the e where would you reach if you reach with your finger where would it be if you reach with your elbow where would it be if i so this is a mental picture i 'm describing a mental vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices for themselves about what to make okay you can open your eyes if you had them closed so the dancers have been working on them so just keep working on them for a little second so they 've been working on those mental architectures in the here i know here it comes i 'm going to organize it quickly so you 're going to do the first the next solo blah blah ladies and gentlemen world premiere ted dance three versions of physical thinking and if not that at least misbehave more beautifully more often"
