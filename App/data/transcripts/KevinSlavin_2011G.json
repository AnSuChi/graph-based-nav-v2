  "transcript": "this is a photograph by the artist michael najjar and it 's real but it 's also a fiction there 's a lot of work that went into it after that and what he 's done is he 's actually digitally all of the so what you see that precipice that high precipice with the valley is the two thousand and eight financial crisis the photo was made when we were deep in the valley over there i don 't know where we are now and it 's with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math not just financial math but math in general that its transition from being something that we extract and derive from the world to something that actually starts to shape it the world around us and the world inside us and it 's specifically algorithms which are basically the math that computers use to decide stuff they acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again and they ossify and calcify and they become i was thinking about this of all places on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago because i happened to be seated next to a hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about and i said so what were you doing and he said well we were how does that work and to understand that you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works and so an over simplification but basically and you could turn it into a million little things something like a flock of birds well then the radar that 's looking for that has to be able to see and whenever we saw a flock of birds that had electronic what do you do when you grow up and he said and it 's also sometimes called algo trading algorithmic trading and algorithmic trading evolved in part because institutional traders have the same problems that the united states air force had which is that they 're moving these positions whether and the magic and the horror of that is that the same math that you use to break up the big thing into a million little things can be used to find a million little things and sew them back together and figure out what 's actually happening in the market so if you need to have some image of what 's happening in the stock market right now what you can picture is a bunch of algorithms that are basically programmed to hide and that 's seventy percent of the united states stock market seventy percent of the operating system formerly known as your pension and what could go wrong nine percent of the entire market just disappears in five minutes and they called it the flash crash of two a sudden nine percent just goes away and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it nobody asked for it nobody had any control over what was actually happening all they had was just a monitor in front of them that had the numbers on it and just a red button that and that 's the thing is that we 're writing things we 're writing these things that we can no longer read and and we 're starting to make our way there 's a company in boston called nanex and they use math and magic and i don 't know what and they reach and they do what we 've always done when confronted with huge amounts of data that we don 't understand which is that they give them a name and a story so this is one that they they called the knife these aren 't just running through the market you can find these kinds of things wherever you look once you learn how to look for them you can find it here this book about flies that you may have been looking at on amazon you may have noticed it when it 's out of print still if you had bought it at one point seven it would have been a bargain a few hours later it had gone up to and when you see this kind of without any adult supervision to say actually one point seven million is plenty and as with amazon so it is with netflix and so netflix has gone through several different algorithms over the years they started with cinematch and they they 've tried a bunch of others there 's dinosaur planet there 's gravity they 're using pragmatic chaos now pragmatic chaos so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next which is a very very but the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don 't really quite have it down determines in the end sixty percent so one piece of code with one idea about you is responsible for sixty percent of those movies but what if you could rate those movies before they get made wouldn 't that be handy well a few data scientists from the u k are in hollywood and they have story algorithms a company called epagogix and you can run your script and they can tell you quantifiably that that 's a thirty million dollar movie or a two hundred million dollar movie and the thing is is that this isn 't google this isn 't information these how would we know and they 're in your they 're in your house these are two algorithms competing for your living room these are two different cleaning robots that have very different ideas about what clean means and you can see it if you slow it down and attach lights to them and they 're sort of like secret architects in your bedroom and the idea that architecture itself is somehow subject to algorithmic optimization is not a sealed metal box a new style elevator they 're called so none of this mishegas of letting everybody go into whatever car they want everybody who wants to go to the 10th floor goes into car two and everybody who wants to go to the third floor into car five and the problem with that is that people freak out it 's because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation like the buttons like the things that people use all it has is just the number that moves up or down and that red button that and this is what we 're designing for we 're designing for this machine dialect and how far can you take that how far can you take it you can take it really really far so let me take it back to wall street because the algorithms of wall street and they operate on milliseconds and microseconds and just to give you a sense of what microseconds are it takes you but if you 're a wall street algorithm and you 're five microseconds behind you 're a loser so if you were an algorithm you 'd look for an architect like the one that i met in frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper throwing out all the furniture all the infrastructure for human use and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in all so an algorithm could get close to the internet and you think of the internet as this kind of distributed system and of course it is but it 's distributed from places in new york this is where it 's distributed from the carrier hotel and this is really where the wires come right up into the reality is that the further away you are from that you 're a few microseconds behind every time they 're eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the carrier hotel and that 's going to keep happening we 're going to keep hollowing them out because you inch for inch and pound for pound and dollar for dollar none of you could squeeze revenue out of that space like the boston shuffler could but if you zoom out if you zoom out you would see trench between new york city and chicago that 's been built over the last few years by a company called spread networks this is a fiber optic cable that was laid between those two cities to just be able to traffic one signal thirty seven times faster than you can click a mouse and when you think about this that we 're running through the united states with dynamite and rock saws so that an algorithm can close the deal three microseconds faster unfortunately we have our work cut out for us this is just theoretical this is and the truth is i don 't really understand a lot of what they 're talking about it involves light and what this map says is that if you 're trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are that 's where people are where the cities are you 're going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are build bubbles or something or platforms we 'll actually part the water to pull money out of the air because it 's a bright future if you 're an algorithm and it 's not the money that 's so interesting actually it 's what the money motivates that we 're actually terraforming the earth itself with this kind of algorithmic efficiency they 're prophecy and the landscape was always made by this sort but now there 's this third co evolutionary force algorithms the boston shuffler the carnival they are"
