  "transcript": "i told my parents i was gay the first thing they said to me was we 're bringing you back to taiwan in their minds my sexual orientation was america 's in truth i wondered if they were right of course there are gay people in asia just as there are gay people in every part of the world but is the idea of living an out life in the i 'm gay this is my spouse and we 're proud of our lives kind of way just a western idea or any place outside of the west would i have found models of happy thriving lgbt people lisa dazols i had similar notions as an hiv social worker in san francisco i had met many gay immigrants they told me their stories of persecution in their home countries just for being gay and the reasons why they escaped to the us i saw how this had beaten them down but surely not every gay story was tragic jc so as a couple we both had a need to find stories of hope so we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the and most of all proud of who they were they would be the kind of person that i aspire to be our plan was to share their stories to the world through film ld there we had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience we didn 't even know where to find the ordered a book on how to make a documentary you can learn a lot these days and set off on one of the first countries that we traveled to was nepal and now recently a devastating earthquake one of the key figures in the movement is bhumika shrestha a beautiful vibrant transgendered woman bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated here 's the decision for the nepal government to give same sex marriage ld i can appreciate bhumika 's confidence on a daily basis something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don 't fit in traveling throughout i had to come up with a strategy so that i could just pee in peace so anytime i would enter a restroom i would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts putting out my my hands and saying hello just so that people could hear my feminine voice i can 't be anything else traveled to india when we spoke to activists they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality where the women 's status is established and in that way the status of lgbt people can be affirmed as well ld there we met prince manvendra came out on the oprah winfrey show very internationally his parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly here he there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society and that we are transgender bisexual or whatever sexual minority we come from but in the hearts and the minds of the people jc while getting my hair cut the woman cutting my hair asked me do you have a husband now this was a dreaded question that i got asked a lot by locals while traveling when i explained to her that i was with a woman instead of a man she was incredulous and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents reactions and whether i was sad that i 'd never be able to have children now this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy westerner she couldn 't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her manvendra from television and soon i had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me i had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country ld from india we traveled to east africa a region known for intolerance towards lgbt people in kenya we met the soft spoken david kuria david had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government so he decided to run for senate he became kenya 's first openly gay political candidate david wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was but we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats he stayed authentic ld at the opposite end of the spectrum is argentina in two thousand and ten argentina became the first country in latin america and the world to adopt marriage equality i wish i could have shown my parents what we found there i had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken mandarin chinese we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands and we learned that asia 's largest lgbt pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live if only my parents knew ld by the time we finished our we traveled to fifteen countries and interviewed fifty supergays turns out it wasn 't hard to find them at all jc yes there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality and but there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the what we ultimately took away from our journey is equality is not a western invention ld one of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another when argentina embraced marriage equality when ireland said yes to equality when the us supreme court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of jc what we realized is that we were watching a love story it wasn 't a love story that was expected of me but it is one filled with more freedom adventure and love i could have ever possibly imagined marriage equality came to california and in the end we believe love will win out"
