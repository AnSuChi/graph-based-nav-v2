  "transcript": "this story starts with these two my kids we were hiking in the oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek she looked at me and said that doesn 't go there when she said that it reminded me of summer camp everyone pick up five pieces of litter why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model and that was the inspiration for the vision is to create a litter free world let me show you how it started i took a picture of a cigarette using instagram and two at the end of a few days i had fifty photos on my phone and i had picked up each piece and i realized that i was keeping a record of the positive impact and they started this photo showed up was more than just pretty pictures we were becoming a community that was collecting data each photo tells a story it tells us who picked up what a geotag tells us where and a time stamp tells us when so i built a google map and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up and through that process the community grew and the data grew my two kids go to school right in that bullseye litter it 's blending into the background of our lives but what if we brought it to the forefront what if we understood exactly what was on our streets our sidewalks and our school yards how might we use that data well let me show you the first is with cities and then they got sued by big tobacco who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards is neither precise nor provable the city called me and asked if our technology could help i 'm not sure they realized that our technology was my instagram account but i said yes we can every photograph is five thousand pieces later our data was used in court to not only defend generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars for san francisco to clean itself up now during that process i learned two things one instagram is not the right tool every city in the world has a unique litter fingerprint and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem and the path to the solution if you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes well what about coffee cups or soda cans or plastic bottles you could fingerprint san francisco well how about oakland or amsterdam or somewhere much closer to home and what about brands how might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests there 's a block in downtown oakland that 's covered in blight the litterati community got together and picked up one thousand five hundred pieces and here 's what we learned most of that litter came from a very well known taco brand most of that brand 's litter were their own hot sauce packets and most of those hot sauce packets hadn 't even been opened the problem and the path to the solution well maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request or installs bulk dispensers or comes up with more sustainable packaging how does a brand take an environmental hazard turn it into an economic engine and become an industry hero if you really want to create change there 's no better place to start than with our kids a and they learned that the most common type of litter were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria so these kids went to their principal and asked why are we still buying straws but together they created an impact this is a community one piece at a time"
