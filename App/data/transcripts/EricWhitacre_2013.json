  "transcript": "i had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life i was in the third year of my seven year undergraduate degree i took a couple victory laps in there and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus and we we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains and there were crickets and and birds and frogs making noise and as we sat there over the mountains coming in from the north were these steven spielbergian clouds so help me god every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time boom this massive thunderclap and sheets of rain it was just extraordinary and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz decided to set it to music a piece for choir called cloudburst which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment now fast forward to just three years ago you can see my little video there we premiered virtual choir two two thousand and fifty two singers from fifty eight different countries this time performing a piece that i had written called sleep and then just last spring we released virtual choir three had written this time nearly four thousand singers from seventy three different countries and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could could we do this in real time could we have people singing i 'm joined by singers from cal state long beach cal state fullerton and riverside community college some of the best amateur choirs in the country and we 've pushed the technology as far as it can go but there 's still so what i 've done is i 've adapted cloudburst so that it embraces the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together so with deep humility and for your approval we present so the no in real time no so far into the time"
