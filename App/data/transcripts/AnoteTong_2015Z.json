  "transcript": "we could start by just telling us about your country it those dots are pretty huge i think each one is about the size of california tell us about kiribati anote tong well let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful i am for this opportunity to share my story i think i 've been sharing my story with but the gilbert group on the the west we have the the phoenix islands in the middle and the is perhaps the only country and also in the east and the west of the international date line these islands are and on average about two meters you 're suffering why don 't you move back they don 't understand they have no concept of what it is that 's involved with the rising sea they say well you can move back and so this is what i tell them if we move back we will fall off on the other side of the ocean but these are the kinds of issues that people don 't understand ca so certainly this is just a picture of fragility there when was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country at well the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades and when i came into office three i began talking about climate change at the united nations general assembly but not with so much passion because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human induced whether it was real or it wasn 't but i think that that debate was made a categorical statement that it is real it 's human induced and it 's predicting some very very serious scenarios for i talked about it when the scenarios the predictions came in two thousand and seven it became a real issue for us ca now those predictions are i think that but what would you say to a skeptic who said what 's three feet you 're on average six feet above sea level what 's the problem 's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land because much of the land is low and quite apart from that we are getting i think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future it 's already with us we have communities who already have been dislocated they have had to move and every parliament session i 'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls and so in my trips to the different i 'm seeing evidence of communities which the contamination of the water lenses and i see these communities perhaps leaving having to relocate within five to ten years ca and then i think the country suffered its i 'm sure many of you understand that it 's supposed to be in the doldrums we 're not supposed to get the cyclones we create them and then we send them either north or south but for the first time at the beginning of this year the cyclone pam and in the process the very edges of it actually touched our two southernmost islands and all of tuvalu tuvalu was underwater but for our two southernmost islands we had and so this has never happened before it 's a new experience and i 've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades they 've been totally destroyed so this is what 's happening but when we talk about the rising sea level we think it 's something that but what we are beginning to witness is the the change in the weather pattern which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level ca so the country is already seeing effects now as you look forward what are your options as a country as a nation at well i 've been telling this story every year i think i visit a number of i 've been traveling the world to try and we think we have a plan and on one occasion i think i spoke in geneva and there was a gentleman who was these people are looking for solutions and so i have been looking at floating islands the japanese we have made a commitment that no matter what happens we will try as much as possible to stay and and continue to exist as a nation what that will take it 's going to be something quite significant or we we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe it 's going to be very very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need ca and then the only recourse is some form of forced migration at well we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community we are preparing those who choose and want to do that to migrate we something to happen that that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared of course our culture is very different our society is very different and once we migrate into a different environment a different culture there 's a whole lot of adjustments that are required ca well there 's forced migration in your country 's past and i think just this week just yesterday or the day before yesterday what 's the story here at yes and i 'm sorry i think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place good reason because but these were people who were relocated from the phoenix islands in fact in the and so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people they didn 't know who i was heard of me some of them later recognized me but later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally but i think what i saw yesterday was very interesting because here i see our people i spoke in our language and of course they beginning not to be able to speak kiribati properly i saw them there was this lady with red teeth she was chewing betel nuts and it 's not something we we do in kiribati we don 't chew betel nuts i met also a family who have married and so this is what is happening there is bound to be and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate ca it must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity the joy of seeing you and and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost and it 's very inspiring to hear you say the end to try to preserve the nation in in a location at nobody wants ever to leave their home you don 't and so i 've been asked on a number of occasions and i and i know that on occasions i 'm accused of it 's something that 's got to be done collectively climate change is a global phenomenon and the countries when we come to the united nations i was in with the pacific island forum countries there was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions it would be something that they 're unable to do because i hear you i understand what saying but try also to understand what i 'm saying because and so it 's a matter for you to weigh this these moral issues it 's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people ca you know i ask you yesterday what made you angry and you said i don 't there was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning i had to change my my approach i had to become more reasonable because but i remain radically whatever that is ca now i think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way at well we eat fish every day every day and i think so it 's fish that we depend on so you 're dependent on fish both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business for tuna and yet despite that a few years ago you took a very radical step can you tell us about that i think something happened right here in the phoenix islands at let me we have one of the largest in the pacific i think we own something like sixty percent of the remaining tuna fisheries and it remains relatively healthy for some species but not all and kiribati is one of the three major and which drives everything that we do hospitals schools and what have you but politically locally it was not easy but i i was convinced that we had to do this in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable there had been some indications that some of the species in particular the the bigeye was under serious threat the yellowfin was also heavily fished skipjack remains healthy another reason why i did that was because i had been asking the international community that in order to deal with climate change in order to fight climate change so in asking and forgoing commercial fishing in the phoenix islands protected area we are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue it may prompt healthier fisheries how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas the negotiations have been very difficult but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day for any vessel to come in now to $ whereas in the past these these fishing boats might be fishing in a day and maybe catch ten tons and so we 've got to respond likewise we 've got to be very very careful because the the technology has so improved there was a time but now they 've got ways of doing it and they 've become so efficient can you give us a sense of what it 's like in those negotiations because you 're up against companies that have essentially is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to on licensing in order to get the rate of return because what we are getting from license fees is about ten percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of of the wharf what we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry in the harvesting in the processing and eventually hopefully the marketing they 're not easy to to penetrate but we are working towards that and yes the answer would be to enhance in order to increase our rate of and so we 've started doing that and we have to restructure the industry we 've got to tell these people that the world has changed now we want to produce the fish ourselves ca they but what is business like for them is it getting harder are the waters depleted or is that being run on a sustainable basis fishery we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except mostly here in the us it 's very very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners ca so here 's a couple of beautiful girls from your country i mean as you think about their future what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world at well i 've been telling the world that we really have to do something about what is happening to the climate i think i have twelve my wife knows it 's about their future every day i see my grandchildren about the same age as these young and i get angry sometimes yes i do i wonder what is to become of them and so it 's about them that we should be telling everybody that it 's not about their own national interest because climate change regrettably unfortunately is viewed by many countries as a national problem it 's not and this is the argument we got into recently with what about the rest why don 't you keep it if you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries within your borders we 'd have no question you can go and so surely and yet we refuse to do and we deal with it and it 's got to be dealt with collectively ca somehow to people we 're slightly better at responding to that sometimes and it seems like it 's very possible that your nation despite actually because of the intense problems you face you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly most powerfully i just want to thank you i 'm sure on behalf of all of us for your extraordinary leadership and for being here"
