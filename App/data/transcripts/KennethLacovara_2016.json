  "transcript": "and i 'm going to tell you the secret first find rocks of the right age now let me break down this formula depending on what your interests are if you want to find trilobites you have to find the really really old rocks of the paleozoic rocks between a half a billion and a quarter billion years old now if you want to find dinosaurs don 't look in the paleozoic you won 't find them they hadn 't evolved yet you have to find the younger rocks of the mesozoic and in the case of dinosaurs between two hundred and and sixty six million years ago now it 's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point because the earth is to a coarse degree geologically mapped the annals of earth history are written in rocks one chapter upon the next such that the oldest pages are on bottom and the youngest on top now were it quite that easy myriad geological processes offer every possible insult most pages are pages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time are never truly safe unlike the moon our dead rocky companion the earth is alive pulsing with creative and destructive forces that power its geological moon rocks are forever earth rocks on the other hand face the perils of a living lithosphere thus the volumes of earth history library is vast and magnificent and it was this tattered complexity in the rock record that obscured its meaning until relatively recently nature provided no card catalog for geologists this would have to be invented five thousand years after the sumerians learned to record their thoughts on clay tablets the earth 's volumes remained inscrutable unaware of the antiquity of our own planet 19th century that our blinders were removed first with the publication of theory of the earth in which he told us that the earth reveals no vestige of a beginning giving us for the first time predictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur after that you could say things like if we go over there we should be in the jurassic if we go up over that hill we should find the cretaceous if you want to find dinosaurs like i do find the rocks of mesozoic you can 't have a fossil in an igneous rock formed by magma like a granite or in a metamorphic it 's that you need to go to a place that 's a desert today a place that doesn 't have too many plants covering up the rocks and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface so find those three things rocks of the right age that are sedimentary rocks and you literally walk until you see a bone sticking out of the rock here 's a picture that i took in southern patagonia every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone so when you 're in that right situation it 's not a question of whether you 'll find fossils or not and to help with that i 'm going to add a fourth part to our formula which is this get as far away from other paleontologists as possible it you have a much better chance of not only finding fossils but of something that 's new to science so that 's my formula for finding dinosaurs and i 've applied it all around the world in the austral summer of two thousand and four i went to the bottom of south america to the bottom of patagonia argentina to prospect for dinosaurs a place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age in a desert a place that had been barely visited by paleontologists and we found this this is a femur a thigh bone of a giant plant eating dinosaur that bone is two point two meters across that 's over seven feet long now unfortunately that bone was isolated we dug and dug and dug i found this another and there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me the giant that people ask me sometimes was dreadnoughtus bigger than a t rex that 's the mass of eight or nine t rex now one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist is when you find a new species and i 've always thought it a shame that these giant plant eating dinosaurs are too often portrayed as passive lumbering platters of meat on the landscape they 're not the bison in yellowstone injure far more people so can you imagine a big bull that animal would have been incredibly dangerous a menace to all around and itself would have had nothing to fear and thus the name passively controlling its temperature and that long neck also serves as a feeding mechanism dreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck clear out a huge envelope of vegetation taking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few and these animals evolved a the penalty for falling over now after this particular dreadnoughtus carcass was buried worms and insects its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis exchanging molecules with the groundwater and becoming more and more like the entombing rock as layer upon layer of sediment accumulated pressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove whose firm and enduring grip epoch after epoch of sameness nonevents without number all the while the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging in perfect equilibrium meanwhile earth history unfolded above the dinosaurs would reign for another twelve million years before their hegemony was snuffed out and then in east africa an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought these brainy primates were not particularly but they excelled at covering ground and in a remarkable diaspora surpassing even the dinosaurs ' record of territorial conquest they dispersed across the planet ravishing every ecosystem they encountered along the way inventing culture and metalworking and painting and dance and music and science and rocket ships that would eventually take twelve excellent apes to the surface of the moon it was not lost on me that the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record is vanishingly small but the earth is very very old and over vast tracts of time the improbable becomes the probable that 's the magic of the geological record each one a small miracle collectively inevitable sixty six million years ago an asteroid hits the earth and wipes out the dinosaurs this easily might not have been but we only get one history and it 's the one that we have but this particular reality was not inevitable the pivotal calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out setting the stage for the modern world as we know it didn 't have to be it could 've just been another day a thursday perhaps among the sixty three billion days already enjoyed along the path from our innumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular the bones of dreadnoughtus lay underground for million years who could have imagined that a single species of shrew like mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world would evolve into sentient beings capable of characterizing and understanding the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded i once stood at the head of the missouri river and bestraddled it there it 's nothing more than a gurgle of water that issues forth from beneath a rock the stream next to it runs a few hundred yards and ends in a small pond those two streams and the other is the missouri river but go up into the bitterroots and look at the missouri now go back to the cretaceous period and look at our tiny fuzzball ancestors you would never guess that they would amount to anything special and they probably wouldn 't have were it not for that pesky asteroid now make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems and let them run you will never get the same result no doubt those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable but they not be our world and they would not have our history there are an infinite number of histories that we could 've had we only get one and wow did we ever get a good one dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car because it gives us perspective and humility snuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own other hand and the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting our species is propagating an environmental disaster of geological proportions that is so broad and so severe it can rightly be called the sixth extinction and unlike the dinosaurs do something about it that choice is ours"
