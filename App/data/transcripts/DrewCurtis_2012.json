  "transcript": "by a company called gooseberry natural resources owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology like phone calls on the internet and so on the and as a result most of these lawsuits end in settlements and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case in the case of gooseberry natural and it turns out that is press release as in p r and as a result we were not in violation of this patent so case closed right which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on and this can take quite a while you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes eighteen months when you win that is your best case even though and this is important none of these companies infringed on this patent not a one of them and they started settling out the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit clearly two million now perhaps it 's because no but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle their attorney my company 's having a reorganization on our end never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l a with no employees and we 'd like to go ahead and close this out so would you mind we didn 't have high hopes for that outcome now as mentioned before one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there 's no non disclosure agreement on this case now how did that happen well during the settlement process when we received our copy now why you can call them they 're not under nda either first of all if you can don 't fight the patent fight the infringement patents are very difficult to overturn infringement is a lot easier to disprove now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements finally make sure that you can tell them now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way it turns out because they 're paid on contingency it works really really well in reverse don 't forget that don 't negotiate with terrorists patent trolls have done more damage to the united states economy than any domestic now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system and the problem with that is that there are two very large industry groups that have and as a result patent trolls can kind of and i thought i should patent this behold patent infringement via mobile device defined as a computer which is not stationary thank you"
