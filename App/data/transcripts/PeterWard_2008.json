  "transcript": "this beautiful picture from my childhood i love the science fiction movies here it is this island earth and leave it to hollywood to get it just right two and a half years in the making i mean even the creationists give us six thousand but hollywood goes to the chase and in this movie we see what we think is out there flying saucers and aliens every world has an alien and every alien world has a flying saucer and they move about with great speed aliens well don brownlee my friend and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the tv and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night and tried to write a counter argument to it for a planet to be an earth to have a place where you could probably get not just life but complexity which requires a huge amount of evolution and therefore constancy of conditions so in two thousand we wrote rare earth in two thousand and let 's not think about where earths are in space but how long has earth been earth if you go back two billion years you 're not on an earth like planet any more what we call an earth like planet is actually a very short interval of time well rare earth actually taught me an awful lot about meeting the public right after i got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention and with all great earnestness walked in david brin was going to debate me on this and as i walked in the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily a girl who came up who said my dad says you 're the devil you cannot take people 's aliens away from them and expect to be anybody 's friends well the second part of that soon after and i was talking to paul allen i saw him in the audience and i handed him a copy of rare earth and jill tarter was there and she turned to me and she looked at me just like that girl in the exorcist it was it burns it burns because seti doesn 't want to hear this seti wants there to be stuff out there i really applaud the seti efforts but we have not heard anything yet and i really do think we have to start thinking about major intelligences on earth a mac to a pc and it can 't even get the letters right please repeat i mean there we are our planet is a good planet because it can keep water mars is a bad but venus is a very bad the worst planet even though it 's earth like and even though early in its history it may very well have harbored earth like life it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse that 's an eight hundred degrees [ fahrenheit ] surface because of rampant we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what 's going to happen to our particular planet we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence of at least life on planet earth following the first horrible microbial age and from what we can tell we 're halfway through we have as much time for animals to exist on this planet as they have been here now till we hit the second microbial age and that will happen paradoxically everything you hear about global warming we are no longer going to have to have plants that are allowed to have any photosynthesis and there go animals the sun increases in its intensity in its brightness and this is what 's left horribly and that 's the fate of a planet too earth if we 're lucky enough if it doesn 't get hit by a hale bopp well paleontologists for the last two hundred years have been charting death it 's strange extinction as a concept wasn 't even thought about until baron cuvier in france found this first mastodon he couldn 't match it up to any bones on the planet and he said aha and very soon after the fossil record started yielding a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been since complex life really began to leave a very interesting fossil record and the father mother mother geologists called these mass extinctions all along it was thought to be either an act of god or perhaps long slow climate change and that really changed in one thousand nine hundred and eighty in this rocky outcrop near gubbio trying to figure out what was the time difference between these white rocks which held creatures of the cretaceous period and the pink rocks above which held tertiary fossils how long did it take to go from one system to the next and what they found was something unexpected they found in this gap in between a very thin clay layer and that clay layer this very thin red layer here and it 's filled with quartz grains that have been subjected to enormous pressure shock quartz now in this slide the white is chalk and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean the chalk itself 's composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor k t a the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs the death of these beautiful ammonites and this paradigm from one thousand nine hundred and eighty to about two thousand totally changed how we but we haven 't witnessed a big asteroid impact so this is a type yes we were hit and yes the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction well there are five major mass the last five hundred million years called the big five sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions and every one of these has been subsequently blamed on large body impact the most recent the permian was thought to have been an impact because of this beautiful structure on the right this is a buckminsterfullerene because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes of my late beloved ' 60s they 're called buckyballs and when the comet hits the pressure produces the but is this true in one thousand nine hundred and ninety ninety working on the k t extinction for ten years i moved to south africa to begin work twice a year in the great karoo desert camping by this boer graveyard for months at a time and the fossils are extraordinary you know you 're this is a gorgonopsian or a gorgon sprawled like a lizard probably had a head like a lion this is the top carnivore the t rex of its time of stuff this is my poor son patrick hold still you 're the scale laughter there was big stuff back then fifty five species of the age of mammals had well and truly started two hundred and fifty million years ago but it did this is a skull i 've discovered just before taking this picture there 's a pen for scale it 's really tiny this is in the lower triassic after the mass extinction has finished you can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front if that does not survive i 'm not the thing giving this talk we are not here there are no mammals it 's that close one species ekes through well but we 've got survivors and things that crocodile like creatures there 's no dinosaurs yet just this slow saurian scaly nasty swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes and there they would hide for one hundred and sixty million years until liberated by that k t asteroid and the what i think is that we returned over and over again to the pre cambrian world that first microbial age and the microbes are still out there they hate we animals they really want their world back and they 've tried over and over and over again anti gaian this whole gaia idea that life makes the world better for itself anybody been on a freeway on a friday afternoon in los angeles believing in the gaia theory no so i really suspect there 's an alternative and that life does actually try to do itself in not consciously but just because it does and here 's the weapon it seems that it did so over the last five hundred million years there are microbes which through their metabolism produce hydrogen sulfide and they do so in large amounts hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans as small as two hundred parts per million will kill you you only have to go to the black sea and a few other places some lakes and get down itself turns purple it turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide and the last three years have seen an enormous breakthrough in a brand new field but the new wave of paleontologists my graduate they take the sediment itself they extract the oil from it and from that they can produce compounds which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups it 's because lipids are so tough they can get preserved in sediment and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary and be extracted and tell us who was there and we know who was there at the end of the permian at many of these mass extinction boundaries this is what we find isorenieratene it this led lee kump and others from penn state and my group to propose what i call the kump hypothesis many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen by high co2 and the worst effect of global warming it turns out hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans this is a view of the earth now if we extract a lot of it and each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb actually the effects are even worse but carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide so these are new data rob berner and i from yale put together and what we try to do now is track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record and we can do this from a variety of means and put all the red lines here when these what i call greenhouse mass extinctions took place the earth has never had any ice on it when we 've had one thousand parts per million co2 we are at three hundred and eighty and climbing we should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most but my friend david battisti in seattle says he thinks a one hundred years i 'm going to have waterfront all right what 's the consequence the oceans probably turn purple they stop complex life we know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet and i throw this slide in this is me actually two months ago and this is a tracking experiment and any of you scuba divers if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever but the thing about this is that every once in a while i 'm eighty miles from shore happen to me well now i die i 'm given a gas mask eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide i i 'm cooled fifteen degrees lower and the reason i could do that this is mark roth he was funded by darpa tried to figure out how to save americans after battlefield injuries he bleeds out pigs he puts in eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions and he turns a mammal mammal into a reptile i believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles having undergone a series of exposures to h2s i got this email from him two years ago he said i think i 've got an answer to some of your questions so he now has taken mice down for as many as four hours sometimes six hours that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through the dotted line the temperatures so the temperature starts at and down it goes down it goes six hours later up goes the temperature now the same mouse is given eighty parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph and look what happens to its temperature its temperature drops it goes down to fifteen degrees centigrade from and comes out of this perfectly fine here is a way we can get people to critical care here 's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care and so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen you 're in an accident you 've got two choices you 're going to die or you 're going to take the hydrogen sulfide and say seventy five percent of you is saved but there 's going to be a cost to it but there 's a far worse danger confronting us we can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world give us a few millennia and we humans should last those few millennia will it happen again if we continue how many of us flew here how many of us have gone through our entire kyoto quota just for flying this year how many of you have exceeded it yeah i 've certainly exceeded it we have a huge problem facing us as a species we have to beat this i want to be able to go back am i understanding you right that what you 're saying here is that we have in our own bodies a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions due to climate change peter ward yeah this is what roth has found out does it leave a signal does it leave a signal in bone or in plant and we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect how many of these have happened in the past ca it 's simultaneously an incredible medical technique but also a terrifying"
