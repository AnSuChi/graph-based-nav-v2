  "transcript": "and i was there and i worked in that job because i believe that technology can improve people 's lives and he said to me you can put a man on the moon but when i get home tonight i won 't be able to turn on my lights at the time the u s government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction how do you ensure technology how do you put it in their hands so that it is useful but customers who live on less than four dollars a one of the key areas we 've been working on recently is medical devices and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq 's electricity grid then despite the advanced technology it 's not reaching the people who need it most so i 'm and this project started when the jaipur foot organization the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world came to the bay area and they said we need a better knee you 've lost your limb in a vehicle accident most people think it 's land mines but it 's a vehicle accident you 're walking by the side of the road and you 're hit by a truck or and your pant leg gets caught and the reality is is that if you don 't have much money like this young named kamal right here the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around and how big a problem is this and what are their options this is a high end this is what we 'd call a smart knee it 's got a microprocessor inside it can pretty much do anything but it 's twenty thousand dollars and to give you a sense of who wears this veterans american veterans coming back from afghanistan or iraq would be fit with something like this and all that that means is the mechanism is a four bar mechanism that mimics a hundred dollars it 's still too expensive for people like kamal and lastly here you see a low end knee this is a knee that 's been designed specifically for poor people and this is the type of mechanism that the jaipur foot organization was using when they were looking for a better knee and i just wanted to give you a sense and this fits over someone 's residual limb and everyone 's residual limb is a little bit different and we 've been able to develop a knee a polycentric knee so that type of knee mimics human gait for eighty dollars retail and we looked at three things that we really believe technologies to customers to users to people who need it and the first thing is that the product needs to be world class it needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market regardless of your income level you want the most beautiful the best product that there is i 'm going to show you a video now and something that 's not obvious that you can 't see is that it 's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling and he 's doing that same and you can see his stability is much better they do different things they sit so the second thing we learned and this leads into my second point which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be and at d rev we go one step further and we say you need to the supply chain everything that goes first version the jaipur knee so this is it right here notice anything about it so if you 're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari it 's really obvious that you 're wearing a prosthetic limb and in societies where there 's social stigma around being disabled so i 'm going to show you some of the modifications we did we did a lot of iterations not just around this but some other things but here we have the version three the remotion knee but if you look in here you can see and something that 's not obvious is that we designed it market driven means it also has to be designed to be very affordable but a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer and use is what creates impact and we believe that as designers and with centralized manufacturing it needs to be economically well the standard is is ours is seventy nine percent and we 're hoping to get that higher our knees are worn in twelve countries this is where we want to get though in the next three years we 'll double the impact in two thousand and fifteen and we 'll double it each of the following years after that so i want to end with a story of and she traveled twelve hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with and while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers and she said well now that i can walk again i can go back and complete my studies and to me she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users"
