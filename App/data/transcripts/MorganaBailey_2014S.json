  "transcript": "i prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative u s state i live in kansas i wasn 't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles i was outspoken extremely social even these pictures and postcards of my london semester abroad sixteen years ago show that i obviously didn 't care if i was perceived as weird or different but that same year i was in london sixteen i realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique and that changed i became the opposite of who i thought i once was i stayed in my room instead of socializing i didn 't want to stand out in the crowd anymore i told myself it was because i was growing up and maturing after all i was a bit unconventional but i realize now that the moment i realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that i began conforming and it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out in fact even now when i was talking to people about what this talk was about i made up a cover story and i even hid the truth about my ted talk so it is fitting and scary that i have what have i been hiding for sixteen years i am a lesbian i 've struggled to say those words because i didn 't want to be defined by them but i just want to be known as morgana uniquely morgana but not my lesbian friend morgana or my gay coworker morgana just morgana for those of you from large metropolitan areas it may seem strange that i have suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long by my fear of not being accepted and i 'm not alone of course a two thousand and thirteen deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity of all the employees they surveyed sixty one percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work of all the gay lesbian and bisexual employees eighty three percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not appear at work too gay the study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion long term career advancement and while i was surprised that so many people just like me waste so much energy trying to hide themselves i was scared when i discovered that my silence has the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay lesbian and bisexual people twelve years reduced life expectancy the effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination what i once thought was simply a personal matter i realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine my choice to hide and not share who i really am but the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when i missed an opportunity to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of kansas in february the kansas house of representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services a former coworker and friend of mine he voted in favor of the bill in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me bisexual transgender queer and questioning people how does her father feel because i was never honest with them about who i am and that shakes me to the core i will never know and that made me realize how ironic that i work in human connect and encourage the development of employees a profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace and yet i have done nothing to advocate for diversity when i came to this company one year ago i thought to myself this company has policies that protect gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people i did nothing my london semester abroad sixteen years ago i came to"
