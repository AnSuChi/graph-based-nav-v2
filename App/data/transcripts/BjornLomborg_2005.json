  "transcript": "what i 'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world i 'm not going to talk about the skeptical environmentalist probably that 's also a good choice i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i 'm actually going to ask you to i 'm just going to list some of them there are eight hundred million people starving there 's a billion there are several million people dying of hiv and aids the lists go on and on there 's two we would solve them all but we don 't and that 's fifty billion dollars over the next four years to spend to do good in this world where should we spend it we identified ten of the biggest challenges in the world and i the obvious question would be because but we don 't have a technology and that would be of course that gets a little more complicated to climate change and so on priorities and also and that 's of course where economics gets evil the amazing part of this i would love to i only have eighteen minutes i 've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time right i 'd love to go into and get you to think about this process and that 's actually what we did and i also strongly encourage you and i 'm sure we 'll also have these discussions afterwards you have to ask yourself why on earth was such a list never done before and one one reason is that prioritization is every organization would love to be on the top of such a list but every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list and since there are many more not number one yet we 've never actually made so it doesn 't mean that we are not prioritizing any decision is a prioritization so of course we are still prioritizing if only implicitly and that 's unlikely to be as good as if we actually did the prioritization and went in and talked about it so what i 'm proposing is really to say that we have for a very long time had a situation when we 've had a menu of choices there are many many things we can do out we have not had an idea imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card but you have no idea what the price is you know you have a pizza it could be a family size pizza it could be a very individual size pizza right we 'd like to know these things and that is what the copenhagen consensus is really trying to do to try to put prices on these issues and so basically this has been the copenhagen consensus ' process we got thirty of the world 's best economists three in each area so we have three of world 's top economists write about climate change what can we do what will be the cost and what will be the benefit of that and so on then we had some of the world 's top economists eight of the world 's top economists including three nobel laureates meet in copenhagen in may two thousand and four we called them the dream team the cambridge university prefects decided to call them the real madrid of economics that works very well in europe but it doesn 't really work over here and of course i 'm very happy you asked that because that 's a very good question you can 't ask either of them because that 's not what they do that is what economists do they prioritize they make that so this is the list and this is the one i 'd like to share with you of course you can also see talk about it more i 'm sure as the day goes on they basically came up with a list where they said there were bad you get less than a dollar back then there 's fair projects good projects and very good projects and of course it 's the very good projects we should start doing i 'm going to go from backwards so that we end up with the best projects these were the bad projects as you might see the the bottom of the list was climate change this offends a lot of people and that 's probably why is it it came up and i 'll actually also try to get back to this because it 's probably one of the things that we 'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down the reason why they came up with saying that kyoto or doing something more than kyoto is a bad deal is simply because it 's very inefficient it 's not saying that global warming is not happening it 's not saying that it 's not a big problem but it 's saying that what we can do about it is very little at a very high cost that 's a substantial amount of money so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in two thousand one hundred can wait until two thousand one hundred and six which is a little good but not very much good and just to give you a sense of reference the u n actually estimate that for half it 's just simply not our first priority the fair projects notice i 'm not going to comment on all these but it 's also very very costly again what it tells us is suddenly we start thinking about both sides of the equation if you look at the good projects a lot of sanitation and water projects the fourth best problem is it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations if we invested about thirteen billion dollars but perhaps more importantly we could avoid about a [ million ] people getting infected in the long run also to deal with global warming half of which would accrue to the third world again the point is to say that we could actually pull two to three hundred million people out of poverty two to five years that would be the third best thing we could do the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition not just malnutrition in general but there 's a very cheap way of dealing with malnutrition namely the lack of micronutrients basically about half of the world 's population is lacking in iron zinc iodine and vitamin a if we invest about twelve billion dollars we could make a severe inroad into that problem that would be the second best investment that we could do and the very best project what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with hiv aids one is treatment the other one is prevention and treatment is much much more expensive than prevention so basically what this focuses on is saying we can do a lot more by investing in prevention basically for the amount of money that we spend and ten times as much good in i find a lot of people find it very very unlikely that we should there are many problems out there in the world and what i want to make and i think actually one of things that people forget even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the u n estimate that the average person in the developing but the point or do we want to help real poor people right now in bangladesh who really need the help and whom we can help very very cheaply or as schelling put it imagine if you were a rich as you will be a rich chinese a rich bolivian a rich congolese in and saying how odd so much more so i think that really does tell us why it is we need to get our priorities straight even if it doesn 't accord to the typical way we see this problem of course we have you know the day after tomorrow it but don 't expect emmerich to cast brad pitt in to make sure that we realize it 's not about making us feel good it 's not about making things that have the most but it 's about making places where we can actually do the most good in an ideal world i would certainly agree the developed world decided we were going to spend twice as much likewise people are also saying but what about the iraq war you know we still want to spend that in the best possible i should just mention briefly is this really the right list that we got out you know you and they 're not necessarily you know great ways of looking at the entire world so we actually invited eighty young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university and they spoke english the majority of them were first from developing countries they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion and they certainly did to come up with their own lists and the surprising thing was that the list was very similar with malnutrition and diseases at the top and climate change at the bottom we 've done this many other times there 's been many other seminars and university students and different things they all come out with very much the same list and that gives me great hope really in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead in an ideal world again we 'd love to do everything but if we don 't do it then we can start thinking about where should we start i see the copenhagen consensus as a process we did it in two thousand and four and we hope to assemble many more people getting much better information for two thousand and eight two thousand and twelve map out the right path for the world but also to start thinking about political triage to start thinking about saying let 's do not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost not the things that we don 't know how to do but let 's do the great things where we can do an enormous amount of good at very low cost"
