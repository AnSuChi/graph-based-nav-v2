  "transcript": "they go to see michelangelo 's david and when they finally come face to face with the statue they both freeze dead in their tracks the first guy we 'll call him adam is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form the second guy we 'll call him bill is transfixed which for al gore i don 't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes we all know that it 's bill and in this case the stereotype corresponds to reality it really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience people who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty variety diversity new ideas travel people low on it like things that are familiar that are safe and dependable if you know about this trait you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior you can understand why artists are so you can understand why anybody would eat at applebee 's but not anybody that you know this trait also tells us a lot about politics the main researcher of this trait robert mccrae says that open individuals have an affinity for liberal progressive society which is open and changing whereas closed individuals prefer conservative traditional right wing views this trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join so here 's the description of a group i found on the web what kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all this is from some guy named ted and openness predicts who becomes a tedster then might we predict that most tedsters are liberal let 's find out i 'm going to ask you to raise your hand whether you are liberal left of center on social issues we 're talking about primarily or conservative and i 'll give a third option because i know there are a number of libertarians in the audience so please raise your hand down in the simulcast rooms too let 's let everybody see who 's here please raise your hand high right now ok about a two dozen and please raise your hand if you 'd say you are right of center or conservative because if our goal is to understand the world to seek a deeper understanding of the world our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder it shuts down open minded thinking when the liberal team loses as it did in two thousand and four and as it almost did in two thousand we comfort ourselves we try to explain why half of america voted we think they must be blinded by religion or by simple stupidity if you think that half of america votes republican because they are blinded in this way then my message to you is that you 're trapped in a moral matrix in a particular moral matrix and by the matrix i mean literally the matrix like the movie the matrix you can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions or you can take the red pill learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix now because i know ok and besides let 's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us psychology developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds and the best definition of innateness i 've ever seen this just clarifies so many things for me is from the brain scientist gary marcus he says the initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience nature provides a first draft which experience then revises built in doesn 't mean unmalleable it means organized in advance of experience ok so what 's on the first draft of the moral mind to find out my colleague craig joseph and i read through the literature on anthropology on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology looking for matches what are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines that you find across cultures and even across species the first one is harm care we 're all mammals here we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others care for others feel compassion for others especially the weak and vulnerable it gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm this norman rockwell painting is called the golden rule and we heard about this from karen armstrong of course as the foundation of so many religions that second foundation underlies the other thirty percent of the moral statements i 've heard here at ted the third foundation is in group loyalty do find groups it 's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate join together into groups but in this case groups that are united to fight other groups this probably comes from our long history of tribal living of tribal psychology laughter sports is to war as pornography is to sex we get to exercise some ancient ancient drives but authority in humans is is not so closely based on on power and brutality as it is in other primates it 's based on more voluntary deference and even elements of love at times the fifth foundation is purity sanctity this painting is called the allegory of chastity and while the political right may moralize sex much more the political left is really doing a lot of it with food food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays and a lot of it is ideas about purity about what you 're willing to touch or put but as my son max grows up in a liberal college town how is this first draft going to get revised and how will it end up being different from a kid born sixty miles south of if there really are five systems at work in the mind five sources of intuitions and emotions then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels where you can set it to a different setting on every channel and my colleagues brian nosek and jesse graham and i which we put up on the web at and so far thirty thousand people have taken have taken this questionnaire and you can too here are the results here are the results from about american citizens so as you see people care about harm are very low liberals are basically saying no this is not morality in group authority purity this stuff has nothing to do with morality i reject it but as people get more conservative the values rise we can say that liberals have a kind of a morality conservatives have more we find this in every country we look at here 's the data for one thousand one hundred canadians i 'll just flip through a few other slides latin america the middle east east asia and south asia notice also that on all of these graphs the slope is steeper on in group authority purity which shows that within any country we debate over what 's fair but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter moral arguments within cultures are especially this effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question in one recent study we asked people to suppose you 're about to get a dog you picked a particular breed you learned some new information about the breed suppose you learn that this particular breed is please but if you 're conservative that 's not so attractive if you 're conservative and you learn that a dog 's extremely loyal to its home and family and doesn 't warm up quickly to strangers for conservatives well loyalty is good dogs ought to be loyal but to a liberal it sounds like this dog is running for the republican nomination there are these differences between liberals and conservatives but what makes those three other foundations moral aren 't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and puritanism what makes them moral the answer i think is contained in this incredible triptych from hieronymus bosch we see the moment of creation all is ordered all is beautiful all the people and animals are doing what they 're supposed to be doing where they 're supposed to be but then given the way of the world things change we get every person doing whatever he wants with every aperture of every other person and every other animal some of you might recognize this as the but the ' 60s inevitably gives way to the ' 70s where the so this this triptych these three panels portray the timeless truth but lest you think this is just some part of the christian imagination where christians have this weird problem with pleasure pleasure here 's the same story the same progression told in a paper that was published in nature a few years ago in which ernst fehr and simon gachter had people play a commons dilemma a game in which you give people money and then the experimenter doubles what 's in there and then it 's all divided among the players so it 's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues where we 're asking people to make a sacrifice and they and what happens is that at first people start off reasonably cooperative and this is all played anonymously on the first round people give about half of the money that they can but they quickly see you know what other people aren 't doing so much though i don 't want to be a sucker i 'm not going to cooperate but then and here 's the trick fehr and gachter said on the seventh round they told people you know what new rule if you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren 't contributing you can do that and as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on cooperation shoots up it shoots up and it keeps going up there 's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems it really helps it 's not enough to just appeal to people 's good motives it really helps to have some sort of punishment you need some sort of punishment to bring people when they 're in large groups to cooperate there 's even some recent research suggesting that religion priming god making people think about god often in some situations leads to more cooperative more pro social behavior some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere in part for the purpose of i think that 's probably right although this is a controversial issue but i 'm particularly interested in religion and the origin of religion and in what it does to us and for us because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand canyon the grand canyon is really simple it 's just a lot of rock and then a lot of water and wind and a lot of cooperating with each other or on the savannahs of africa or on the frozen shores of alaska the answer i think is that they used every tool in the toolbox because liberals reject three of these foundations they say no let 's celebrate diversity let 's question authority and they say keep your laws off my body to women to people that don 't fit in they want change and justice even at the risk of chaos this guy 's shirt says stop bitching start a revolution if you 're high in openness to experience revolution is good it 's change it 's fun conservatives so once you see this once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute that they form a balance on on change versus stability then i think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix this is the great insight that all the asian religions have attained you find the same thing in hinduism you have the markings of vishnu on the and they work together you find the same thing in buddhism these two stanzas contain i think the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology from the zen master seng ts 'an if you want the truth to stand clear before you never be for or against the struggle between for and against is the mind 's worst disease but before you feel superior to george bush before you throw a stone ask yourself do you accept this if you take the greatest insights from ancient asian philosophies and religions and you combine them with the latest i think you come to these conclusions that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth so am i telling you to embrace seng ts 'an and stop stop with this struggle of for and against no absolutely not i 'm not saying that is an amazing group of people who are doing so much using so much of their of their talent their brilliance their energy their money to solve problems but as we learned from samantha power in her you can 't just go charging in saying you 're wrong and i 'm right everybody thinks they are right a lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people and if you want to change other people a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are understand our moral psychology understand that we all think we 're right and then step out even if it 's just for a moment step step out of the moral matrix just try to see it as as a struggle playing out in which everybody does think they 're right and everybody at least has some reasons even if you disagree with them everybody has some reasons for what they 're doing step out and if you do that to get yourself out of this self righteousness which is the normal human condition think about the dalai lama think about the enormous moral authority of the dalai lama and it to make the world a better place"
