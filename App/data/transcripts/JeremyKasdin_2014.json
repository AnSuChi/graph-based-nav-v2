  "transcript": "my colleagues at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory at princeton and i are working on technology that will be able to do just that in the coming years but we haven 't seen any of them we 've only detected them indirectly this is nasa 's famous picture of the pale blue i want to take that of an earth like planet about another star well to see let 's imagine we take the hubble space telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of mars we 'll see something like that a slightly here we are at the orbit of uranus it 's gotten smaller it 's got less detail less resolve we can still see the little moon but let 's go ten times further away again now it 's not resolved at all it 's that pale blue dot of carl sagan 's but let 's move yet again ten times further now that 's what we want to see that 's why it 's hard the light from the star we have to do something about all of that light we have to get rid of it i have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that but i want to tell you about one today that i think is the coolest and probably the most likely to get us an earth in the next decade it was first suggested by lyman spitzer the father of the space telescope and he took his inspiration from an eclipse you 've all seen that that 's a solar eclipse the moon has moved in front of the sun it blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and well what 's going on well the moon removed and we can see that dim fine structure in the corona we put it up in front of the star we block out most of the light we fly a space well that would look something like this and but spitzer actually knew the answer if we can feather the edges soften those edges so we can control and in the last ten years or so we 've come up with optimal solutions for doing that it looks something like that and now we have a great shadow it 's about ten billion times dimmer than it was before and we can see the planets beam out just like that but brilliant engineers colleagues of mine at jpl came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this it starts wrapped around a hub it separates from the telescope it 's going to move in front of the star we get planets orbiting about it thank that 's not science fiction we 've been working on this for the last five or six years last summer we did a really cool test out in california at northrop grumman so those are four petals this is a sub scale now you 're seeing it deploy we ran this test sixteen times sixteen times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter this has to be done very precisely but if we can do this if we can build this technology if we can get it into space you might see something like this that 's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the hubble space telescope put it out there fly an occulter in front of it what we might see is something like that that 's a family portrait of our solar system but not ours we 're hoping it 'll be someone else 's solar system as seen through an see if there 's water i think this is the coolest possible science that thank you"
