  "transcript": "percent of us and we crave one thing even though we kind of don 't know it all the time we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded the day it was played and so we said there 's a solution to this let 's separate the performance as a thing out from the recording and it 's the data hidden inside the recording in order to do this it 's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there and you probably didn 't realize it 's going to do all these things but full of solenoids and fiber optics and computers and all this kind of stuff the highest resolution out of japan and this just didn 't work until we could cross this line that says high definition and we were able to cross this line called the uncanny valley in terms of and then a whole lot of and you know it 's a thing your piano teacher teaches you but we never had a science behind these kinds of things i 'm going to start with glenn gould he died twenty five years ago this year and was born seventy five years ago this year was a beloved pianist maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century he just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like a performing monkey was in fact and gould 's specialty was playing bach his maybe most famous recording was something called the goldberg variations bach only wrote themes and variations one time he wrote some early pieces but late in his life in his mature period he said here 's a theme thirty variations in fact the theme isn 't even the melody it 's the bass line and the one in mono by the way and as he got older he said no no wait a minute i 'm going to get very scientific about this and not use the pedal what i 'd like you to hear live is the first of all let me get you to the end step this is we have a fairly complex process that you know software and musicians and so on but when we 're all done we know that the ear is final arbiter what you just heard and and i 'm going to play them together at the same time the there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle and then you heard the original but if not it 's so involving but if you don 't have that maybe you and so on the same disk we have five recordings sony has five recordings and you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording and it 's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument you 're inside and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process it 's a game changer here 's now something we know in spectacular quality the whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity what you heard today was not perfect it 's and they 're all amazingly without putting dates next to these things music will be turned into data like every field that 's occurred in the past audio has come very late to this game i 'm not talking about digitizing and bits and re mastering i 'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from which is how it was performed and you can 't trick them very easily your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement you know all right there 's this episode of i get it it was all just laid in for me yesterday there and at some point he 's dancing with his and i won 't ruin the episode for you from one thousand nine hundred and sixty seven spock sits down at the piano and he starts playing this brahms waltz and they all dance to it and then spock turns round he goes james i know all of the brahms waltzes and i don 't believe this is one of them in the category i want to hear the pieces that horowitz didn on a path now when we get to data that we can distill styles and templates and formulas and all these kinds of things again that you 've seen happen in the computer graphics world it 's now coming in this world the transition will be this one it says right now we think music is notes and how they 're played and i believe this is coming because what you 've just heard was a computer playing data no glenn gould in the room but yet it was human and i believe you 'll get to the next step the real dream of listeners every time you listen to a recording today every time you take out your ipod and whatever every time you listen to it it 's the same thing it 's frozen wouldn 't it be cool if every time you listened it could be different this morning you 're sadder you want to hear your song you want to hear it played by different musicians you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever"
