  "transcript": "his wife 's hand quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch i 'm not sure it seems a bit extreme to me that image was the start of the x ray technology and i 'm still fundamentally using the same principles today the first shot i ever did was of a soda can which was to promote a brand that we all know so i 'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it but the second shot i did was my shoes i was wearing on the day and i do really like this shot because it shows all the detritus that 's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers time moving on to something a bit larger this is an x ray of a bus and the bus is full of people it and back in the ' 60s they used to teach student radiographers to take x rays thankfully not on you and i but but everyone on that bus is frieda and the bus is taken with a which is the sort of machine you have on borders which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things fairly obvious what that is so using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don 't see x rays of big things that often technology is moving ahead and these large cargo scanner and i think the reason this image works again is because frieda is driving the bulldozer shows how exquisite they are fashion now i 'm sort of anti fashion because i don 't show the surface i show what 's within don 't really like me because it doesn 't matter if kate moss is wearing it or if i 'm wearing it it looks the same the creases in the material and the sort of nuances and and i 'm sure ross can associate that with design the design comes from within i live opposite a farm and this was the runt of the litter a piglet that died and what 's really interesting is if you look at the legs you 'll notice that the bones haven 't fused and should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after i x rayed it with the amount of radiation i used anyway but once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy so that 's an empty parka jacket but i quite love the way it 's posed nature is my greatest inspiration if you look at the roof of and i 'm sure those architects are inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature this in fact is a victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond now how do i do this and where do i do this and all of that sort of thing this is my new one thousand two hundred and fifty kilograms and the only exercise i get is opening and closing it the walls are seven hundred millimeters thick of solid dense concrete so i 'm using quite a lot of radiation a lot more than you 'd get in a hospital or a vet 's and there i am this is a quite high powered x ray machine what 's interesting really about really is if you think about it is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs or looking for contraband or whatever and i use that sort of technology to create things that still working with film i 'm afraid technology in apart from these large cargo scanning machines hasn 't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it which is show was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film they scan each individual x ray when you move forward something fairly small a dress which is this size onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process you can see that that is a lot of work and i sent them back an x ray one on the is a photograph of an american footballer the one on the left is an x ray but this time i had to use a real body because i needed all the skin tissue to make it look real to make it look like it was a real athlete and getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious but people do donate their bodies to art and science and when they do i 'm in the queue so i like to use them it 's not accurately colored to how it is in real life that flower doesn 't come in bright orange i don 't think but i just like it in bright orange and also with something technical like these are dj decks it sort of adds another level it makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional the most difficult things to believe me if there is anyone out here who knows anything about x rays that 's i 'm now going to show you a short film i 'll step to the side if you touch that you could possibly die through radiation poisoning in my career i 've had two exposures to radiation which is two too but also it looks like it 's a robot which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants the lorry goes in front of it and it takes slices and that 's how this was done bit like a ct scanner in a hospital slices and then if you look carefully there is all little things he 's got headphones on reading so these little details help to make it work make it real the problem with using living people is that to take an x ray if i x ray you you get exposed to radiation so to avoid that i have to avoid it somehow is i use dead people now that 's a variety of things from recently deceased bodies to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking x rays of the human body at different densities i have very high tech equipment of gloves scissors and a bucket music i will show how the capillary action works how it feeds i 'll be able to get all the cells because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves look at this monster the way the leaves form they 're curling back on each other so the x ray will show the overlaps in these little corners the less radiation sometimes you keep the time up because the time gives you detail the longer the exposure goes on for the more detail you get but everything else would suffer so these leaves at the edge would start to disappear what i like is how hard the for what it 's worth for what it 's really made of how it really works but also i find that which is things that people are used to seeing and that 's the sort of thing i 've been doing i 've got the opportunity now to show you and what 's good about this i think is that it 's like a moment in time like you 've turned around you 've got x ray vision and you 've unfortunately i haven 't got x ray vision i do dream in x ray i see my projects in my sleep and i know what they 're going to look like in x ray which is one of my favorite and with this image i 'm going to be displaying it in the victoria and albert museum and if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car you see light box of the car showing you how it works"
