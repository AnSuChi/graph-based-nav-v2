  "transcript": "the electricity powering the lights in this theater because the way things stand today electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid the difference would have to be made up but coal plants nuclear plants can 't respond fast enough a giant battery could with a giant battery we 'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal gas and nuclear do today and that changes everything because then renewables such as wind and solar come it 's a new form of energy storage that i invented at mit along with a team of my students and post docs now the theme of this year 's ted conference is full the entire range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays of which the range of visible light is only a small part so i 'm not here today only to tell you how my team at mit has drawn out of nature a solution to one of the world 's great problems i want to go full spectrum and tell you how in the process of developing this new technology we 've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies that can serve as and you know if we we can 't bomb our way out we 're going to do it the old fashioned american way we 're going to invent our way out working together now let 's get started and new technologies such as perhaps overlooked volta 's invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor until volta nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use here 's the first battery a stack of zinc and silver separated by cardboard soaked in brine this is the starting point for designing a battery two electrodes in this case metals of different composition the science is that simple admittedly i 've left out a few details now i 've taught you that battery science is straightforward and the need for grid level storage is compelling but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting the demanding performance requirements of the grid namely uncommonly high power long service lifetime and super low cost we need to think about the problem differently instead let 's invent to the price point of the electricity market so that means that off limits this battery needs to be made out of make it out of dirt and we need to be able to build this thing so about six years ago i started thinking about this problem i sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage in fact i looked to a technology that neither stores nor generates electricity but instead consumes electricity huge amounts of it i 'm talking about the production of hall in the united states and heroult in france and just a few short years following their discovery aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material you 're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter it 's about fifty feet wide and recedes about half a mile row after row of cells that it 's fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that 's a solution of salt and water the hall heroult cell operates at high temperature a temperature high enough that the aluminum metal product is liquid it 's this combination of liquid metal molten salt and high temperature that allows us to send high current through this thing we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than fifty cents a pound that 's the economic miracle of i made the battery all liquid liquid metals for both electrodes and a molten salt for the electrolyte i 'll show you how liquid metal at the bottom so now how to choose the metals for me the design exercise always begins here dimitri different opposite density i felt the thrill of realization when i knew i 'd come upon the answer magnesium and antimony for the bottom layer you know i 've got to tell you colored chalk laughter so to produce current magnesium loses two electrons to the electrons go to work in the real world out here and then we reverse and this forces magnesium to and return to the upper electrode restoring the initial constitution of the battery and the current passing between the electrodes generates enough heat to keep it at temperature it 's pretty cool at now do i hire i hire a student teach him how to think about the problem to see it from my perspective appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work but david 's young and he 's smart and he wants a ph d and he proceeds to build he proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry which were paid with seed funds at mit i was able to attract major research funding from the private sector and that allowed me to expand my group to twenty people not science and service for career building and if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery their answer would hearken back to president kennedy 's remarks at rice university in nine hundred and sixty two when he said and i 'm taking liberties here we choose to work on grid level storage not because it is easy but because it is hard i called it the shotglass and then it was onto the saucer that 's two hundred watt hours but the pace wasn 't fast david and i along with another research staff member formed a company to accelerate the rate of progress we 're building cells sixteen inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt hour one thousand times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell we call that the pizza and one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules aggregating the modules and this has a nameplate capacity of two two million so here you have it what have we learned from all this so what have we learned from all this let me share with you some of the surprises the heterodoxies and then install a control system to keep it there avoid thermal runaway liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature with minimum regulation conventional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost by producing fewer but they 'll be larger conventional wisdom says hire battery experts seasoned professionals who can draw upon their vast experience i hired students and post docs and mentored them so you see the liquid metal battery story it 's a blueprint for inventing inventors"
