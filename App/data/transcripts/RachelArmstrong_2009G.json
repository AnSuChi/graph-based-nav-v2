  "transcript": "all buildings today have something in common this involves blueprints industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers all of this effort results in an inert object and that means that there is a one way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities this is not sustainable i believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature not insulating them from it in order to do this we need the right kind of language and this is the way in which so i 'm interested in the use but they don 't exist so i 'm having to make them and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach that means we 're generating them from scratch and he 's really interested martin he works with a system called the protocell now all this is this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living it is able to move around its environment it can follow chemical gradients it can undergo complex reactions some of which are happily architectural we don 't know how they do that yet this is a violent process and that 's the shell around that globular fat they are quite brittle so you 've only got a part of one there so what we 're trying to do is we 're trying to push these technologies construction approaches for architecture which contrast the current victorian top down methods which impose structure upon matter that can 't be energetically sensible they 've been in use and have a look at the brickwork which and if you look even closer you 'll see in that limestone there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other and then they are fossilized over millions of years now a block of limestone in itself isn 't particularly that interesting it looks beautiful but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere maybe they could extract carbon dioxide architects are never happy with just one block of an when we think about scaling up metabolic materials we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water now venice as you know has a tempestuous relationship with the sea and is built upon and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city this is our protocell technology effectively making a shell like its limestone forefathers and depositing it in a very complex environment against natural materials we 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this now this is the very interesting part we don 't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals what we need it to do is to be creatively so you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light we kind of chemically engineer them and this isn 't going to happen also it will attract the who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture this is terrestrial chemistry we 've all got it which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries so in summary i 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies and building architectures from a"
