  "transcript": "david is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent or at least pretends to be that he asked me to to question him rather than speaking in fact what we 're going to talk about i think is in fact and i guess we have a bit of news clip to precede dan rather since the september 11th attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at now as cbs 's jim axelrod reports they 're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene jim axelrod forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty there 's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest ground zero tourist i 've taken my step daughter here from indianapolis this was out of all the tourist sites in new york city this was thousands now line up on lower broadway tourist i 've been wanting to come down here since this happened ja even on the coldest winter days to honor and remember tourist it 's reality it 's us it happened here this is ours ja so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem i think that people are very frustrated that they 're not able to get closer to see what 's going on ja but that is about to change in record time a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer man the sheer totality of the destruction of ground zero is unlike most any other tourist site in america unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument people come here to see what 's no longer there david rockwell the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground ja the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter from our hearts it affected us just as much ja the ramps are made of simple material the kind of plywood you see at construction sites which is really the whole point in the face of america 's worst destruction people are building again jim axelrod cbs news new york ka this is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment david you are known as i know a phrase you hate an entertainment architect your work is highly sensual even hedonistic dr i like that word ka it 's about pleasure casinos and hotels and restaurants how did the shock that all of us and especially all of us in new york felt on the on the 11th of september transmute into your desire to do this thing dr well the truth of the matter is i felt myself in the role originally first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was as someone who works less than a mile from there that i was in the role of forcing one hundred people who work with me in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating in fact we 're finishing a book which is called pleasure which is about but i 've got to tell you it became impossible to do that we were really paralyzed found myself the friday after september 11th two days afterwards literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything we gave the office a few days off and in discussing this with other architects we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were they should rebuild them fifty stories taller and i thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound and i had a series of discussions first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something and that as people who the ultimate way to help wasn 't to pontificate or to so we we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that was the mission that we came up with ka were you conscious of suddenly whose work is all about fulfilling wants suddenly fulfilling needs and we were asked to participate in a few projects before this there was a school ps two hundred and thirty four that had been evacuated down at ground zero tom otterness contributed maira kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us ka and that was done effectively by october eight or you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project and this is only one of four that you 've designed to surround the site you you entrenched bureaucracy and and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics dr well it 's a funny thing we finished ps two and there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that so we said what we first approached the city about pier but we have an observation platform for the families down at ground zero that we 'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather so i went down there with rick and liz and kevin it was the most moving experience of my life it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them and there was no mediation between us and the experience there was no filter and i remembered on september 11th on 14th street the roof of our building we can see the world trade towers prominently and i saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the floor on a tv that we had set up there was something about the comfort of the filter and so we went back to the city and said we 're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a vip platform we 've spent some time down there at the same time the city had this need they were looking for a solution to deal with thirty or forty thousand people a day who were going down there so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan there was a way there had to be a way to get people to move around the site but then you 've got to figure out a way we will we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board but simply funding this thing it looks like and we also knew that if it didn 't happen by the end of the giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of the we were meeting with twenty or thirty people with the city at a time and it was set up by the office of emergency management this incredible thing we we had to do was find a way to get this we had to work with the the and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we because the key was not raising a lot of objection and mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to and actually what happened was one major developer in new and he owns rockefeller center if that helps anyone the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost so and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th and we had to start construction the next day we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it ka sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge i guess dr in fact it was as if this was going to be window washing scaffolding there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul that this is really a place and i 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul which is just to the right and moving around the site and i live down there so we spent a lot of time and i think people were amazed at two things i think they were amazed at the destruction but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers so we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this and we said well this is half the size it doesn 't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone everyone in the city we 'd have to go back to to the beginning to do this and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed the next day i got from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding so we didn 't know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net we emailed out letters to as many people as we could several people in the audience here who were very helpful ka there was no thought of abandoning ship in fact i told the contractor to go ahead he had already ordered materials based on my go ahead we knew that one way or another this was going to happen and we just felt it had to happen ka i think very all the chair designers came out about the history of chair designers imposing common problem of sitting it seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that this was an unprecedented singular here 's the issue we knew that this was not in the sense of it was important that this not be categorized as a memorial that this was a place for people to to reflect to remember a kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters it 's all incredibly humble material it 's scaffolding and plywood and it allows by sort of the procession of the movement up by saint paul 's and down the other side it gives you about three hundred feet to go up thirteen feet from the ground to where you get the three hundred and sixty degree view flexible one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions and the changing definition of what ground zero is ka your work i mean we 've talked about this before a lot of your work i think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die this is clearly not a work for the ages you know a couple of years this thing isn 't going to be here that require as an architect a new way of thinking about what you were doing to think of it as this purely temporary installation dr no i don 't think so i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we 'd ever thought about doing before just by where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon rick scofidio liz diller and all the people within the city norman lear who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan so the notion of collaboration i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it our goal was not to create i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about what 's really happening there and which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people and i think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter i think makes it a more powerful dialogue and that 's what we were interested in so that very much is in the realm of things i 've been interested in before ka it seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enables that conversation to get serious months after the fact and only a few months away from the site being cleaned we are very quickly now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious do you have having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project have any ideas about what should i think one thing that shouldn 't be done is evaluate i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings ka but it had some really terrible ideas dr and it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas where i think the and i think there should be a broader which there 's starting to be the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that it 's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion this over so that there 's one uninterrupted piece of land ka well i think that 's interesting and it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago but perhaps isn 't now which is not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not dr and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day regardless of what the number is there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven ka which was the building just north of the towers dr right which the towers fell into and and a call for ideas for uses ka whether it 's arts whether it 's housing whether it 's what amount of shopping dr right and we 're looking for other things this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things ka before we end i know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being so i thought that would be good to end with looking from fulton street complexity and length of time they really take to do it 's three hundred and fifty people on the committee for oklahoma city which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad hoc spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad hoc the scaffolding you can see built up over the street what 's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed so that what you 're aware of around it and the scars on the building around it which are enormous this shows saint paul 's on the left i just want to but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary i don 't know if beauty is the word but presence"
