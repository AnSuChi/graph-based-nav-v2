  "transcript": "we humans have an any tool can be used to build or to destroy therefore it is all the more important to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one so now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times those could be our own mind can be our best friend and then there are the new challenges which we don 't expect whatever they could do the earth 's resilience would soon heal the era of human beings if we were to say if this man was saying and i heard i won 't mention who we were at the edge of the precipice today we made a big step forward so this edge is the same that has been defined by scientists as the planetary humanity can still prosper for one hundred and fifty thousand years but this depends on choosing growing qualitatively not now hold your breath not too long to imagine what comes next now we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries just to take biodiversity by two thousand and fifty thirty percent of all species on earth will have disappeared so here i am sitting in front of a economically scientifically the question of the environment is it simply boils i heard the billionaire steve forbes on fox news saying exactly the same thing but seriously he was told about the rise of the ocean and he said i find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen in a hundred years the ups and downs of the stock the midterm of the quality of life what is the quality every moment of our life over ten years and twenty years and completely incoherent they don 't speak the same language now for the last ten years i went there 's only one concept you will have a caring economics where finance is at the service of society and not society you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with that you bring some kind of well being within society in education at the workplace otherwise a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable you are not going to ransack that planet that we have true altruism or are we so some philosophers thought we were that 's good news isn 't it many philosophers like hobbes have said so but not everyone man a wolf for man but this guy doesn 't seem too bad he so now we love cooperation there 's no better joy than working together is there and then not only humans then of course there 's the struggle for life the survival of the fittest social darwinism but in evolution cooperation though competition exists of course cooperation has to be much more creative to go to increased levels of complexity we are on top of a survey among ten factors including income everything the first one that people said that 's the main thing for my happiness is quality of social relationships this is armchair there is not a single sociological study psychological study that 's ever shown that rather the opposite there 's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically no matter what clearly people can be altruistic so that 's now look at here when we come out we aren 't going to say that 's so nice there was no fistfight while this mob was thinking about altruism so the banality of goodness is something that doesn 't attract your attention but it when i tell them i run one hundred and forty humanitarian projects in the himalayas that give me so much joy they said oh i see you work for the warm glow that is not altruistic you just feel good you think this guy when he jumped in front of the train feel so good when this is over they say well but when you interviewed him he said automatic behavior it 's neither selfish nor altruistic well of course this guy 's not going to think for half an hour should i give my people who had choice like pastor andr trocm and his wife and the whole village of le chambon sur lignon in france for the whole second world war gave them shelter brought them to switzerland against all odds at the empathy but empathy alone burnout so you need the greater sphere of with tania singer at the max planck institute of leipzig we showed that the brain networks for empathy and loving kindness are different now that 's all well done so we got that from but we need to extend that it can be extended even to other if we want a more altruistic society we need two things individual change and societal change so i spent one hundred and twenty hours in an mri machine this is the first time i went after two and a half hours and then the result has been published in many scientific papers it shows without ambiguity that there is structural change and functional change in the brain when you train the altruistic love this is the meditator at rest on the left they have not been trained four weeks twenty minutes a day of caring mindfulness meditation already brings a structural change in the brain compared to a control group that 's only twenty minutes a day for four weeks even with preschoolers richard davidson did that in madison gratitude loving kindness cooperation and then comes the ultimate before you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class so before the intervention they give most of it to their best friend no more discrimination the same amount of stickers to their best friend and the least favorite child that 's something we should do in all the schools in the world now do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race that will take fifty thousand years too much for the environment fortunately as specialists have shown so now individual change and cultural change mutually fashion each other and yes we can achieve a more altruistic society so where do we go from there four percent overhead some people say well your stuff works in practice but does it work in theory there 's always positive deviance enhancing cooperation cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning we need sustainable harmony i love this term not sustainable growth anymore sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality in the future we do more with economicus cannot deal with cannot deal with the problem of the common goods of the atmosphere of the oceans we need a caring economics if you say economics should be compassionate we need to extend altruism to the other one point six"
