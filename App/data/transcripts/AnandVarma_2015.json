  "transcript": "my backyard in berkeley california but national geographic asked me to photograph a story about them and i decided to be able to take compelling images i should start keeping bees myself and lately they 've been having a really hard time so i 'm going this furry little creature is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell but the single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from this eventually destroys a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees and it makes them more vulnerable to stress and disease so i teamed up with a bee lab at u c davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera i 'm going to show you the first twenty one days of a bee 's life condensed into sixty seconds this is a bee egg and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white goo that nurse bees secrete for them then their head and their legs slowly differentiate as they transform into pupae here then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the pigment slowly develops in their eyes the last step of the process is their skin shrivels up and they sprout hair as you can see halfway through that video the mites were running around on the baby bees so researchers are working on finding alternatives to control these mites and this queen and her attendant bees are part of that program now the researchers figured out that some of the bees have a natural ability to fight mites so they set out to breed a line of mite resistant bees this is what it takes to breed bees in a lab the virgin queen is sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument but there 's a tradeoff in having this much control they succeeded in breeding so to overcome that problem these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers the usda is integrating their mite resistant bees into his operation mite resistant and to say it like that makes it sound like we 're manipulating and exploiting bees and the truth is we 've been doing that for thousands of years practically domesticating it and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system so when people talk about saving bees my interpretation of that is we need to save our relationship to bees and in order to design new solutions we have to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors thank you"
