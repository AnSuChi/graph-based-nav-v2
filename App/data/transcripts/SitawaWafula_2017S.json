  "transcript": "i have a confession i wish i could talk about butterflies in my stomach all i can tell you about is the aftermath about days i spent constantly i remember how it all began i was in my final year of high school and my class had just won in sports so and when i sat down to eat my teeth started chattering so i couldn 't put the spoon in my mouth i rushed to the nurse 's office and because i couldn 't talk i just pointed at my mouth i was about to dash out and she told she insisted that i go up to the dormitories to sleep here i was in my final year of high school just a few months from doing my end of high school exams and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in kenya mocks which are somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams there class sat down took my kenyan history notes and there i was down kenyan coastal town with the great was marking imaginary papers in and out it went and with every stroke one by one my classmates stopped concentrating on their reading and then when it was sure everybody was looking at us which was the beginning of what has been affair seizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy and every every first ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor to determine if one has epilepsy or if it 's a symptom of something else in my case it was confirmed that i had epilepsy i spent a large chunk of my time and only went back to do my final exams i had seizures in between but managed to get good enough grades to be admitted for an actuarial science degree at the university of nairobi i was lucky but i was fired from that job when i had a seizure in the workplace so i found myself in a space where i lived in denial dropping out of school and being fired from my job or maybe it was because of the things i had heard about epilepsy and about people living with epilepsy that they would never live on their own that they would never travel on their own or or even get work and so the more i thought about these things and i spent days with my legs locked my speech became blurred and on days on end this is i felt lost and so i started writing because the people around me didn 't have answers to the questions that i had and so i wrote my fears i wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days and before long and i moved from that girl who constantly asked why me to one who not only but does it for those who are yet to find their voices and i travel all these things that i had been told people like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do every year a population population as big as eighty percent of nairobi gets diagnosed with epilepsy go through the emotions of and so i have made it my life journey to keep these and i keep confessing about my affair so that those people who do not have the diagnosis might know and might have a constant reminder thank you"
