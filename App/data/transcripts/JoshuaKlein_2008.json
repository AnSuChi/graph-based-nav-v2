  "transcript": "any of you get really freaked out by that you might want to leave now so this is a vending machine for crows over the past few days many of you have been asking how did you come to this how did you get started doing this it started as with many great ideas or many ideas you can 't get rid of anyway at a cocktail party and he was telling me we ought to eradicate these things kill them because they 're making a mess and i 'm sure i 'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying so i spent the next ten years reading about crows in my spare time but part of the reason i found this interesting is i started noticing that we 're very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion and one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living and in return we just tried to kill them all the time laughter and in doing so we were breeding them for parasitism we were giving them all sorts of so i thought let 's build something that 's mutually beneficial something that we can both benefit from and find some way to make a new relationship with these species so i built the vending machine and in all that area so we may not think about them but they 're always around given the human population growth more than half of the human population is living in cities now and so but what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way but the researchers had a problem they messed up and left just a stick of wire in there and she hadn 't had the opportunity to do this before you see it wasn 't working very well so she adapted now this is completely unprompted she had never seen this done before no one taught her to so keep in mind she 's never seen this done it turns out we 've been finding more and more that crows are really really intelligent their brains are in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are there 's all kinds of anecdotes for the different kinds of intelligence they have for example in sweden crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice and when the fishermen move off the crows fly down reel up the lines and eat the fish or the the bait it 's pretty annoying for the fishermen an entirely different tack at university of washington a brought them in weighed and measured them and let them back out again and they were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week whenever these particular students walked around campus these crows would caw at them and and run around and make make their life kind of miserable until they finally graduated and left campus and glad to get away i 'm sure came back sometime later and found the crows still remembered them so now students at the university of washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask fairly interesting so we know these crows are really smart but the more i dug into this the more i found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation video crows have become highly skilled at they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can 't manage 's significant about this isn 't that crows are using cars to crack nuts in fact that 's old hat for crows this happened about ten years ago in a place called sendai city at a driving school in the suburbs of tokyo they learn from their peers they learn from their enemies if i have a little extra time i 'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity and as we heard yesterday that 's the pandora 's box that 's getting human beings in trouble and we 're starting to see it with them we found out they 're really smart and they can teach each other when all this became clear i realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine so that 's what we did this is a vending machine for crows and it uses skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages it 's pretty simple basically what happens is that we put this out in a field or someplace where there 's lots of crows we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine crows eventually come by eat the peanuts and get used eventually they eat all the peanuts then they see peanuts here on the feeder tray and hop up and help themselves so when they get really used to that we move on when they get really happy about this we stymie them so when that happens they get a peanut when they 're good and comfortable with that we move to the final stage where they show up and nothing happens go away they do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored and then they go off and play in traffic crows on the other hand show up and they try and figure it out they know this machine has been messing with them through three different stages of behavior so they they poke at it and peck at it and eventually some crow gets a bright idea hey and we 're off to the races that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts until his friends figure out how to do it and then there we go so what 's significant about this to me isn 't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts mind you there 's two hundred and sixteen but i 'm not sure i can depend on that roi from crows laughter instead i think we should look a little bit larger or find expensive components from discarded electronics or maybe do search and rescue but involves finding an equilibrium with them that 's a useful balance thanks very much"
