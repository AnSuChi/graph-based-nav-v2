  "transcript": "my travels to afghanistan began many many years ago i was walking through the forests of my grandmother 's tales a land where every field hides a grave where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century then i have been walking east for twenty years middle east north africa and i ever met more humble people and i shared their bread and their prayer this is why i went to afghanistan one day i crossed the bridge but he gave me a cup of tea and i understood that his surprise was my protection by horses by yak by truck by hitchhiking from to the bottom to the edge of the wakhan corridor and in this way i could find my only weapon was the mysticism from gibraltar to india the mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears and welcomed as a gift what do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium made in china with the name of burqa girls studying here and their love know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in but full of the taliban and they did it my aim is to give a voice to the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict"
