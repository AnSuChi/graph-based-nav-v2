  "transcript": "much of what surrounds us started life as but of course look like rocks and sludge now they look like tv cameras monitors and it was also inspired by this quote from douglas adams and the situation is from the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy and the situation it describes is the hero of the book he 's a 20th century man finds himself alone on a strange planet populated only by a technologically and he kind of assumes that yes realizes that without the rest of human society he can so i thought okay i 'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch and working on the the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest to reverse engineer i went and bought the cheapest toaster i could find took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that inside this object which i 'd bought for just there were four hundred different bits made out of i didn 't have the rest of my life to to do this project i had maybe nine months so i thought okay i 'll start with five and these were steel mica plastic copper and nickel i went and knocked on the door of the rio tinto chair of advanced mineral extraction at the royal school of mines and said how do you make steel and professor cilliers was very kind and talked me through it so i phoned up an iron mine and said hi i 'm trying to make a toaster can i come up and get some iron when i got there emerges ray and so wasn 't prepared to take me into the mines but after some nagging i got him to do that when you study geology you can see what 's happened in the past and there were terrific changes in the earth thomas thwaites it wasn 't actually a working mine though ray was a miner there the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction because of course it can 't compete but anyway i got my so i went back to professor cilliers and he said to the library so i did and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy completely useless for what i was trying to do because of course they don 't actually tell you how to do it if you want to do it yourself so i ended up going to the history of science library and looking at this book this is the first textbook on metallurgy written in the west at least and there you can see that woodcut is basically what i ended up doing but instead of a and that was something that reoccurred throughout the project was the smaller the scale you want to work on the further back in time you have to go and so this is after a day and and about half a night smelting this iron i dragged out this stuff and it wasn 't iron but luckily and i was able to finish off the process so my next the next thing i was trying to get was this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world it 's and he said okay i 'll let you have some water from the mine and the reason i was interested in getting water is because water which goes through mines becomes kind of acidic and which is in portugal as you can see it 's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it so many such that it 's now just a home for but anyway the water i dragged back from the isle of anglesey where the mine was there was enough copper in it such that i could cast the pins of my metal electric plug and mica is a mineral which is a very good insulator and very good and the last material i 'm going to talk about today is plastic my toaster had to have a plastic case and so plastic comes from oil so i phoned up bp and spent a good half an hour trying to convince the bp obviously has a bit more on their mind now so i looked at other ways of making plastic and you can actually make plastic from obviously oils which come from plants but also from starches so this and it was looking good for a while but i left it outside because you had to leave it outside to dry so kind of out of desperation i decided and geologists have actually christened well they 're debating whether to christen the age that we 're living in and that 's because so suddenly it will become kind of radioactive from chernobyl and the two thousand or so nuclear bombs that have been set off since one thousand nine hundred and forty five and there 'd also be an extinction event like fossils would suddenly disappear so i looked up a plastic so i decided that i could mine some of this modern day rock which is this european electrical and electronic and that was brought into force to try and deal with the mountain of stuff that is just being made and then living for a while in our homes and then going to landfill but this there 's a picture of my toaster applause that 's it without the case on and there it is on the shelves kew gardens were insistent that i couldn 't come and hack into their rubber tree so the wires were uninsulated so there was two hundred and forty volts going through these but i considered it a partial success"
