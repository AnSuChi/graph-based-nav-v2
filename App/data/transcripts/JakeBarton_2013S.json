  "transcript": "wouldn 't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview but charley had actually been a slave until he was twenty two years old and the stories that were captured of his life make up one of the crown jewels of histories of human lived which set out to capture the stories of ordinary americans you interview your grandmother or relative you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress it 's essentially a way to make a national oral archive one conversation at a time and the question is who do you want to remember if you had just forty five minutes with your grandmother what 's interesting in conversations with the founder dave isay we always actually talked about this as a little bit of a subversive project because when you think about it it 's actually not really about the stories that are being told it 's about listening and it 's about the questions that you get to ask questions that you may not have permission to on any other day i 'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project [ jesus melendez talking about poet pedro pietri 's final moments ] jesus melendez and the beauty about it and so i thought that i would give it to you so i 'm going to share a mic with this is how your mother and i got married in a booth in grand central station with my father 's ring my grandfather was a cab driver for forty years he used to pick people up here every so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry the and we 're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public which we 've created an engagement called gallery one for and we actually brought in this piece glenn lowry the head of moma put it best when he said we want visitors to actually cease being visitors visitors are transient we want people who live here people who have ownership but if you 're interested you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it 's from or manipulate the work itself and this is where it originated from you can see the actual bedroom it really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting this is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself this is rodin 's bust you get the sense of this incredible factory for creativity and it makes you think about literally the hundreds or thousands of years of human creativity and how each individual artwork stands in for part of that story and so our next interface which i 'll show you actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity it 's an algorithm and it 's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she 's looking and so you can imagine that as people are so more and more we 're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves to be creative even as they 're looking at other people 's creativity and understanding them so in this wall the collections wall you can actually see all three thousand artworks all at the same time and you can actually author your own individual walking tours of the museum so you can share them and someone can take a tour with the museum director or a tour with their little cousin but all the while that we 've been working on this engagement for cleveland we 've also been working in the background on really our largest engagement to date and that 's the nine eleven memorial and museum so we started in two thousand and six as part of a team with thinc design to create the original master plan for the museum and then we 've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production so the memorial opened in two thousand and eleven and the museum 's going to open next year in two thousand and and you can see from these images the site is so raw and almost archaeological and of course the event itself is so recent somewhere between history and current events it was a huge challenge so it 's estimated that a third of the world watched nine eleven live and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world through video through photos through written history and so people 's experiences on that day which was in fact this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this and when we started seeing the incredible images and stories that came forth from all around the world this is obviously part of the landing gear we really started to understand that there was this amazing symmetry between the event itself between the way that people were telling the stories of the event and how we ourselves needed to tell that story this image in particular really captured our attention at the time because it so much sums up that event this is a shot from the brooklyn battery tunnel there 's a firefighter that 's stuck actually in traffic and so the firefighters themselves are are running a mile and a half to the site itself with upwards of seventy pounds of gear on their back it was a shock emotionally yet a blessing to find this photo and he was writing because he said i 'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son and it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story can 't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that and so we started imagining the museum along with the creative team at the museum and the curators thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors and so we created idea of an opening gallery called we remember and i 'll just play you part of a mockup of it but you get a sense of what it 's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history i got a call from my father voice fourteen the phone rang it woke me up my business partner told me to turn on the television voice fifteen so i switched on the television voice sixteen all channels in italy were displaying the same thing voice seventeen the twin towers voice eighteen the twin towers and you move from there into that open cavernous space this is the so called slurry wall it 's the original excavated wall at the base of the world trade center that and so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity of presence of that moment into the actual exhibition itself and we tell the stories and as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself and so you can hear oral histories so people who were actually working the so called bucket brigades as you 're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment and as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about nine eleven we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about nine eleven and so these are questions like how can a democracy balance freedom and security how could nine eleven have happened and how did the world change after nine eleven and so these oral histories which we 've actually been capturing capturing already for years are then mixed together with interviews that we 're doing with people like donald rumsfeld bill clinton rudy giuliani and you mix together these different players and these different experiences these different reflection points about nine eleven and suddenly the institution once again turns into a listening experience so i 'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone 's reflection on the event who were there that day who immediately went to help people known and unknown to them was something that would pull us through voice four all the outpouring of affection and emotion that came from our country was something really that will forever ever stay with and i watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy jb reflecting on the experience reflecting on their own and we actually got involved in the memorial after we 'd done the museum for a few years the original designer of the memorial michael arad had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated almost random really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself but it was a huge challenge the families for the foundation certainly for the first responders and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology or in terms of alphabetical but through what 's called meaningful adjacency so these are are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order so this is an image the first responders and you can actually see within that different floors and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections you can actually see the overarching organization inside you can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial and you can search for an individual name or in this case an and use that to navigate the memorial in this case harry ramos who was the head trader at an investment bank who stopped to aid victor wald on the 55th floor of the south tower and ramos told wald according to witnesses i 'm not going to leave you and wald 's widow requested that they be listed next to each other three generations ago we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people today of course there 's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations and this is our hope that 's there 's poetry inside of each of our stories thank you very"
