  "transcript": "and i made a few apps for the iphone ipod touch and ipad i 'd like to share a couple with you today my first app was a unique fortune teller called earth fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was my favorite and most successful app is bustin jieber which is which is a justin bieber whack a mole i created it because a lot of people at school disliked justin bieber a little bit so i decided to make the app so and i released it just before the holidays in two thousand and ten how did i make these a lot of times it 's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also i mean for soccer but what if you want to make an app and but not many parents have written apps this is how i approached it this is what i did first of all i 've and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iphone app and after playing with the software development kit a little bit i made a couple of apps i made some test apps and so i persuaded my parents to pay the ninety nine dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the app store i 've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family and a any student at my school can learn how to design an app this is so i can share my experiences with others i 'm fortunate enough to be part of one a big challenge is how should the ipads be used and what apps should we put on the ipads so we 're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they 'd like when we design the app and we sell it it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations students usually know a little bit more than teachers so this is a resource to teachers and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it i 'd like to finish up by i 'm working with a third party company to make an app i 'd like to get into android programming and development thank you"
