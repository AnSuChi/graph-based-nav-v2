  "transcript": "but i didn 't know it was impossible and that 's how i was able to do it no one had done that kind of movie in quebec before because it 's expensive it 's set in the future and it 's got tons of visual effects and yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid really back when i was reading some comic books and when american for only two point three million so you might wonder what 's the deal here how did i do this well when you don 't have money you must take time and it took me seven years to do and it seems like every department had nothing so they had to rely on our on our creativity and turn every problem and that brings me to the point of my talk actually how constraints big creative constraints can boost creativity i did some graphic novels but they weren 't your usual graphic novels they were books telling a science fiction story through images and text and most of the actors who are now starring in the movie adaptation they were already involved in these in these books portraying characters into theatrical simplistic one of these actors is the great stage director and actor robert lepage and i just love this guy i 've been in love with this guy since i was a kid his and he was kind enough to lend his image to the character of a he was a perfect fit for for the part and robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance he was the the one who believed in me and encouraged me to and produce the film robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity because this guy is the busiest man on the planet i mean his agenda is booked until two thousand and forty two and but the thing is had i waited for for him until two thousand and forty two my film wouldn 't be a futuristic film anymore because you know he is everywhere and nowhere on the planet at the same time and he 's an illuminated being in my mind he 's in between reality and virtual reality so it would make perfect sense to turn this guy into a hologram but the joke was kind of a good solution so that 's what we ended up doing each camera was covering sixty degrees of his head so that in post production we could use pretty much any angle we needed and and he was wearing a green hood so he became like a renaissance man and here 's what it looks like in the movie my second example of how constraints can boost creativity because i desperately needed these objects in my movie they are objects of desire they are imaginary i knew what these but so that 's kind of a big problem too how do you get something that you can 't afford and you know i woke up one morning with a pretty good idea i said what if i have somebody else pay for them and i thought of cirque du soleil in montreal so i found my way to guy lalibert cirque du soleil 's ceo and i presented my crazy idea to him with with sketches like this and visual references and something pretty amazing happened guy was interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money but because i came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy it was kind of a perfect triangle in which the the and obviously i was happy because i got the instruments in my film for free which was so here they are and my last example of how constraints can boost creativity comes from the green because this is a and i had again pretty much but then again i turned to my childhood imagination and went to franois schuiten in belgium and this guy but people told me you know it 's impossible the guy is too busy and he will say no well i said you know what instead of and i sent him my books and he answered that he was interested in working on the film with me because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium in other words there was space for him to dream with me so here i was with of my childhood heroes drawing every single frame that 's in the film eventually you have to turn all these drawings into reality so again my solution was to aim for the best possible artist that i could think of and there 's this guy in montreal another quebecois called carlos monzon and he 's a very good vfx artist this guy had been and i had to convince him and why because i offered him a space to dream so if you don 't have money to offer to people you must strike their imagination with something as as nice as you can think of so this is what happened on this movie and that 's how it got made and we went to this very nice postproduction company in montreal called vision globale and so i want to tell you that if you have some and that people tell you that it 's impossible to make well that 's an even better reason to want to do it because people have a tendency to see the problems rather than the if you start to deal with problems as being your allies rather than your opponents life will start to dance with you in the most amazing way i have experienced it and you might end up doing some crazy projects and who knows you might even end up going to mars thank you"
