  "transcript": "and he discovered that official records were listing him as dead his land was no longer registered in his name his brothers chandrabhan and phoolchand were also listed as dead family members had bribed officials to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land allowing them to inherit their father 's share of the ancestral farmland because of this all three brothers and their families had to vacate their home according to the yadav family the local court has been scheduling a case review since two thousand and one but a judge has never appeared there are several instances in uttar pradesh of people dying before their case is given a proper review shivdutt 's father 's death and a want for his property led to this where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water this quandary led to the title of the project which considers in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways so this story is the first of eighteen chapters in my new body of work titled a living man declared dead and other chapters four year period researching and recording bloodlines and their related chance or circumstance in each chapter you can see the external forces of governance power and territory or religion colliding with the internal forces of psychological and physical inheritance and then on the right is what i refer to as a and it 's meant to kind of and this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline documenting things that have the appearance of being comprehensive through a determined title and a determined presentation but in fact are fairly abstract this led me to blood a bloodline is determined and ordered but the project centers on the collision of order and disorder the order of blood butting up against the disorder represented in the often chaotic and violent stories that are the subjects of my chapters in chapter two i photograph the descendants of arthur ruppin he was sent in one thousand nine seven to palestine he oversaw land acquisition on behalf of the palestine land development company whose work led to the establishment of a jewish state through my research at the zionist archives in jerusalem i wanted to look at the early paperwork of the establishment of the jewish state and i found these maps which you see here are studies commissioned by the zionist organization for alternative areas for jewish settlement in this i was interested in the consequences of geography which is what these maps demonstrate they maintain a card index file of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration to palestine he 's most often paid for his services in cash cows or goats sometimes when his female patients can 't afford his services their families give the women to jura in exchange for medical treatment as a result of these transactions jura has nine wives thirty two children and sixty three grandchildren in his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here two of his wives were brought to him suffering from infertility and he cured them three for evil spirits one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain and two wives ondijo claims he took for love paying their families a total of sixteen cows it 's common among a instances of prominent social and political figures in polygamous relationships has led to the perception of polygamy as a symbol of wealth status and power you may notice in several of the chapters that i photographed there are empty portraits these empty portraits represent living individuals who couldn 't be present and the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel army service women not allowed to be photographed for religious and cultural reasons and in this particular chapter it 's children whose mothers wouldn 't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it european rabbits were brought to australia in and within a hundred years that population of twenty four had exploded to half a billion and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land since the 1950s australia has been introducing lethal diseases into the wild rabbit population to control growth biosecurity queensland where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits and have infected them with a lethal disease so they 're testing its virulence so over a two day period six individuals from this bloodline eight thousand bosnian muslim men and boys were systematically executed so when you look at a following those four children is zumra 's younger sister who is then followed by her children who were killed as well during the time i was in bosnia the mortal remains of zumra 's eldest son were exhumed from a mass grave and i was therefore able to photograph the fully however the other individuals are represented by these blue slides which show tooth and bone samples that were matched to dna evidence collected from family members to prove they were the identities of those individuals they 've all been given a proper burial so what remains are these blue slides at the international commission for missing persons these are personal effects dug up from a mass grave that are awaiting identification from family members this is video footage used at the milosevic which from top to bottom shows a serbian scorpion unit being blessed by an orthodox priest before rounding up the boys and men and killing them chapter fifteen is more of a performance piece i solicited china 's state council information office in two thousand and nine to select a bloodline to represent china for this project they chose a large family from beijing for its size everyone showed up previously known as the department of foreign propaganda the state council information office is responsible for all of china 's external it controls all foreign media and image production outside of china from foreign media working within china it also monitors the internet and instructs religion democracy movements and terrorism and i also photographed the gift bag they gave me when i left now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits highlighting a complex relationship to one 's family history another section of the family presented their clothing as opposed to their physical presence because they didn 't want to be identified and finally another individual sat for me from behind and later rescinded his participation so i had to pixelate him out so he 's unrecognizable in the footnote panel that accompanies this work i photographed an official adolph hitler postage stamp and an imitation of that stamp produced by british intelligence again talking about fate i was interested in the stories and fate of particular works of art and i 'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time they are leonardo da vinci 's lady with an ermine rembrandt 's landscape with good samaritan and raphael 's portrait of a youth which has never been found chapter twelve highlights people being born into a battle that is not of their making but becomes their own so this is the ferraz family and the novaes family and they are in an active blood feud this feud has been going on since one thousand nine hundred but it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation which were used for shooting and looking brazil 's northeast state of pernambuco is one of the nation 's most violent so retaliatory killings have led to several deaths in the area i 'm interested in these ideas of repetition so after i returned home i received word that one member of the family had been shot thirty times in the face children at this ukrainian orphanage are 12 month period when i was at the orphanage only one child had been adopted it 's commonly reported in ukraine that children when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human trafficking child pornography and prostitution this is a girls and the director listed the orphanage 's most urgent needs as an industrial size washing machine and dryer four vacuum cleaners two computers a video projector a copy machine winter shoes and a dentist 's drill shows a sign which i had translated when i got home and it reads those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future but archives exist because there 's something that can 't necessarily be articulated something is said in the gaps between all the information that 's collected and there 's this relentless persistence of birth and death and an unending collection of stories in between it 's almost machine like the way people are born and people the stories keep coming and coming and in this i 'm considering is this actual accumulation leading to some sort of evolution"
