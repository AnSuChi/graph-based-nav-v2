  "transcript": "we belong to the family called the hominidae we are one species of about five and a half thousand mammalian species that exist on planet earth today and that 's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever we 're one species out of approximately or let 's say at least sixteen upright walking apes that have existed over the past six to eight million years but as far as we know we 're the only upright walking ape that exists on except for the bonobos and it 's important to remember that because the bonobos are so human and they share and we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes it but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas the chimpanzee and also the bonobos and it is important to remember that all of these great apes have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey as we ourselves have today and it 's this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family as we 've been in east africa looking for the fossil remains of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past and this is how we look for them a group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly out across vast areas of africa looking and that 's an example of what we may do as we walk across looking for fossils but if you look very carefully there is a it is something that is going to involve a lot more people to begin to piece together our past we still really haven 't got a very complete picture of it we mark it today we 've got great technology we we mark it with a gps fix and we also take we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly using dental picks and where we go again through it very carefully looking for small bone fragments and it 's then washed and these things are so exciting they are so often the only or the very first time that anybody has ever here 's a very special moment when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of of and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother laughter not many people can say that but now let me take you back to it does actually look like a hominid skull now we 're going to go to the east african and the the rift valley it essentially runs up from the gulf of of aden or runs down to lake malawi and the rift valley is a depression it 's a basin and rivers flow down from the highlands into the carrying sediment preserving the bones of animals that lived there if you want to become a fossil you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried you then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface and then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you laughter ok so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much as we do know today about our ancestors because it 's incredibly difficult a for these and if you look north here there 's a big river that flows into the lake that 's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains of the animals that lived there fossil sites run up and down which represents some twenty thousand square miles that 's a huge job that we 've got on our hands two million years ago at lake turkana homo erectus one of our human ancestors actually lived in this region you can see some of the major fossil sites that we 've been working homo erectus up in the far right corner lived alongside and here is a skull of a homo erectus which i just pulled off the shelf there it is the norm where did these things come from that 's what we 're still trying to find answers to and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species and our ancestors are no exception the fossils that have been found essentially accompanying my parents to lake turkana in search of human remains and we were able to dig up when we got old enough fossils such as this when they found essentially the skeleton of this homo erectus i could relate to this homo erectus skeleton very well because i was the same age that and i imagined him to be tall his brothers certainly were able to run long distances chasing prey probably sweating heavily as they did so he was very able to use stones effectively as tools and this individual himself this one that i 'm holding up actually had a bad back he 'd probably had an injury as a child and probably much smaller members of his family group to have got to where he did unfortunately for him he fell into a swamp and couldn 't get out and he remained there until one point six million years later when this very famous fossil hunter kamoya kimeu walked along a small hillside was begun immediately and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment and what was so fun about it was this the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside and so it had decided to grow we began to find limb bones we found finger bones the bones of the pelvis vertebrae ribs the collar bones things that had never ever been seen before in homo erectus it and he was on the threshold of becoming human shortly afterwards members of his species started to move northwards out of africa and you start to see fossils china and also in parts homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave africa and begin its spread across the globe some exciting finds again as i mentioned from dmanisi in the republic of georgia but also surprising finds recently where a group of these and that is truly extraordinary to think about homo erectus left africa ninety thousand generations ago we evolved essentially from an african stock again at about two hundred thousand years as a and until thirty thousand years ago at least three upright walking apes shared the planet earth wasteful aggressive species with a not particularly pleasant at all we have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors is this a good evolutionary adaptation or is it going to lead us to being the and what is it that really makes us us i think it 's our collective intelligence it 's our ability to write things down our language and our consciousness from very primitive beginnings with a very crude tool kit of stones we now have a very advanced tool kit we 've got even from within an excavation we have reached extraordinary numbers of people on this planet human really only survive on planet earth if you look at the we 've only been around for the past two hundred thousand years as a species yet we 've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people and last year our population grew by eighty million i mean these are extraordinary numbers you can see here but we have to control our numbers because we can 't really hold it together as a species my father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species can we hold it together we have a common past and we share a common future and we have the tools and the technology we could tell every single human being out there if we really wanted to but will we do that or will we just let nature take its course"
