  "transcript": "my name is marcin technologist i was born in poland now in the u s i started a group called open source ecology we 've identified the fifty most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist things from tractors circuit makers then we set out to create an open source diy do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost we call this the global village construction set so let me tell you a story so i finished my 20s with a ph d in fusion energy and i discovered i had no practical skills so i started a farm i bought a tractor i realized that the truly appropriate low cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and so i did just that and i tested them prototyping new machines during dedicated so far we have prototyped eight of the fifty machines and now the project is beginning to grow on its own we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity we 're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people 's lives in such tangible material ways then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential that 's not only in the developing world parts manufacturing our goal is a repository of published designs so clear so complete that a single burned dvd i 've pressed five thousand bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days from what i 've seen this is only the beginning if this idea is truly sound then the implications are significant and a newly relevant diy maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity thank you"
