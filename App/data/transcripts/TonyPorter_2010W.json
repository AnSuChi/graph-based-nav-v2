  "transcript": "between harlem and the bronx growing up as a boy we were taught that men had to be tough had to be strong had to be courageous dominating no pain which means women are not that men are strong women are weak property of better known as the man box absolutely wonderful things about being a man time redefining what we come to know as manhood they 're eleven and twelve kendall 's fifteen months older than jay time when my wife her name is tammie and i we just got real busy and whip bam boom kendall and jay it didn 't matter what she was crying about she could get on my knee she could snot my sleeve up just cry cry it out daddy 's got you that 's all that 's important now kendall on the other hand and like i said he 's only fifteen months older than her he 'd come to me crying it 's like as soon as i would hear him cry a clock would go off i was already saying things like why are you crying explain to me what 's wrong tell me what 's wrong i can 't understand you why are you crying and out of my own frustration i would find myself saying things like just go in your room sit down get yourself together and and he 's five years as i grow in life i would say to myself my god what 's wrong with me what am i doing why would i do this and i think back i i think back to my father there was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family we lived in new york city as i said we lived in the bronx at the time and and as we were preparing to come back from the burial the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city and the limousine empties out my mother my sister my auntie they all get out but my father and i stayed in the limousine and no sooner than the women got out but he knew he wasn 't going to make it back to the city and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and and this is a man who ten minutes ago had just put his teenage son in the ground something i just can 't even imagine the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me and at the same time he was also giving me props lifting me for not crying i come to also look at this as this this fear that we have as men this fear that just has us paralyzed holding us hostage and i asked him i said how would you feel if in front of all the players your coach told you you were playing like a girl now i expected him to say something like i 'd be sad i 'd be mad i 'd be angry or something like that no the boy said to me the boy said to me it would destroy me and i said to myself god if it would destroy him to be called a girl it took me back to a time when i was about twelve years old he was about sixteen years old and we were and this guy he was up to a lot of no good he was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder what is this 16 year old boy doing with these 12 year old boys he was being raised by his grandmother his father wasn 't on the set his grandmother had two jobs he was home alone a lot he was fine that 's what the sisters said he was fine he was having sex so one day i 'm out in front of the house doing something just playing around doing something i don 't know what he looks out his window he calls me upstairs he said hey anthony they called me anthony growing up as a kid hey anthony come on upstairs johnny call you go so i run right upstairs as he opens the door he says to me do you want some because for me growing up at that time and our relationship with this man box do you want some meant one of two things sex or drugs my man box card was immediately in jeopardy we don 't talk about that as men you only tell your dearest closest friend sworn to secrecy for life the first time you had sex for everybody else we go around like we 've been having sex since we were two there ain 't no first time especially sexual objects anyway so i couldn 't tell him any of that she 's nude higher functioning at times than others we had a whole choice of inappropriate names for because while sheila never said so he was offering me the opportunity to do the same so when i go in the room i close the door folks i 'm petrified so now i 'm no longer trying to figure out what i 'm going to do i 'm trying to figure out how i 'm going while i was in the room with sheila johnny was back at the window calling guys up so now there 's a living room full of guys it was like the waiting room in the doctor 's office and they asked me how and i say to them it was good and i zip my pants up in front of them and i head for the door but i knew i felt bad about what was happening totally enveloped me enveloped me it was way more and my man box card than about sheila and what was happening to her we see that as an equation that equals violence against women we operate on the foundation of this this whole collective socialization we kind of see ourselves separate but we 're very much a part of it you see so we 're very much a part of the solution as well as the problem the center for disease control says that men 's violence against women is at epidemic proportions is the number one health concern for women in this country i need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men that it 's okay to not be dominating that it 's okay to have feelings and emotions that 's okay to promote equality that it 's okay to have women who are just friends and that 's it that it 's okay to be whole that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman i remember asking a nine year old boy i asked a nine year old boy what would life be like for you if you didn 't have to adhere to this man box he said to me i would be free"
