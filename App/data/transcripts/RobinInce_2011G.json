  "transcript": "i 'd like to apologize first of all to all of you because i have no form of powerpoint presentation you can imagine what you 'd like to i do a radio show the radio show is called the infinite monkey cage it 's about science it 's about rationalism so therefore we get a lot of complaints every single week which is to say the very title infinite monkey cage celebrates the idea of we have made it quite clear to these people that an infinite monkey cage is roomy we know this because they did an experiment yes they gave twelve monkeys a typewriter for a week and after a week they you bring in science and it ruins the magic now i 'm an arts graduate i love myth and magic and existentialism and but i also don 't understand how it does ruin the magic all of the magic i think that may well be taken away by science is then replaced by something as wonderful astrology for instance like many rationalists i 'm a pisces now meet a lucky man who 's wearing a hat but if we want to look at the sky and see predictions we still can we can see predictions of galaxies forming of galaxies colliding into each other of new solar systems this is a wonderful thing if the sun could one day and indeed the earth in fact if the earth that to me as well that if you think i 'm worried about losing worlds well many worlds theory one of the most beautiful fascinating sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation is a wonderful thing that every person here every decision that you 've made today every decision you 've made in your life you 've not really made that decision but in fact that is a wonderful idea always remember there 's another you that 's made much worse decisions than that if you ever think ah i want to end it all don 't end it all remember that in the majority of universes you don 't even exist in the first place this to me in its own strange way is very very comforting now reincarnation that 's another thing gone the afterlife but it 's not gone science actually says we will live forever well there is one proviso but every single thing that makes us has already created a myriad of different things and will go on to create a myriad of new things we have been mountains and apples and pulsars unlike the occupants of the universe the universe itself is not wasteful we are understanding to me does not remove the wonder and the joy for instance my wife could turn to me and she may say why do you love me and i can with all honesty look her in the eye and say matched our olfactory receptors though i 'll probably also say something about her hair and personality as well and that that is a wonderful thing there love does not die because of that thing even though i understand pain if someone punches me and because of my personality this is recently a regular occurrence i understand where the pain comes from it is basically momentum to energy where the four vector is constant that that 's what it is but at no point can i react and go ha is that the best fourth vector constant you 've got no i just spit out a tooth and that is all of these different things the love for my child now i know you don 't think that you may well have your own children and think oh no my child 's best that 's the wonderful thing about evolution the predilection to believe now in many ways that 's just a survival thing the fact we see here is the vehicle for our genes i 've and perhaps you been at home for a week on your own you house is in a terrible state your partner is about to return you think what should i do do nothing everything had happened that 's the strong principle of vacuuming you remove the myth and there is still something wonderful i 'm sitting on a train every time i breathe in i 'm breathing in a i 'm sitting on a chair even though i know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways wherever we are you will be disappointed i realize i 'm observing this with the brain the human brain the most complex thing in the known universe that to me is an incredible thing and do you know what that might be enough steven weinberg the nobel laureate but for me it doesn 't that is a wonderful that 's not the point i can make my own purpose you can make your own purpose we have the individual power to go this is what i want to do and in a pointless universe that to me is a wonderful i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation you i imagine can do much better things with your time thank you very much goodbye"
