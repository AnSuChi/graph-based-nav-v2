  "transcript": "i have to say that i 'm very glad to be here i understand we have over eighty countries here so that 's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries in each country i 'm sure you have this thing called the parent teacher well i remember in third grade i had this moment where my father who never takes off from work he 's a classical blue collar a working class immigrant person going to school to see his son how he 's doing and the teacher said you know john john 's good at math why it became a question my entire life and that 's all right because being good at math meant he bought me a computer and some of remember this computer this was my first computer who had an apple ii apple ii users very cool as you remember the apple ii did nothing at all you 'd that computer is a computer that i learned about going to mit my father 's dream i learned about the computer at all levels and i was influenced by performance art so this is twenty years ago i made a computer out of people it was called the human powered computer experiment i have a power it 's a room broken in two halves i 've turned the computer on and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk and the floppy disk drive person wears it she finds the first sector on the disk and takes data off the disk and passes it off to of course the bus so the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory to the cpu the vram etc and it 's an actual working computer that 's a bus really and it looks kind of fast that 's a mouse driver where it 's xy it looks like it 's happening kind of quickly but it 's actually a very slow computer and when i realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is it made me wonder about computers and technology in general and also a topic that i 've taken on since four years ago i became the president of rhode island school of design so starting from technology it really could do nothing it could show text and remember when images were first possible we waited you see this little pattern here we 're kind of stuck in a loop perhaps and this sense of possibility from computing is something i 've been questioning for the last ten or so years and have looked to design as we understand most things and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine and i have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson content is the word it 's like oh fear who cares right so you can see how you change the scale you change the or fear like this kind of a nightclub typeface like we gotta go to fear i can never get in there it much better content free free is a great word you can serve it almost any way don draper free so you see that form content design it works that way it 's a powerful thing it 's like magic almost like the magicians we 've seen at and i 've been curious about how design and technology intersect and i 'm going to show you some old work i never really show anymore to give you a sense of what i used to laughter but i thought it 'd be neat for the square to respond to me and my kids were small then and and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much it was in black and white monochrome fully monochrome all in integer mathematics it 's called tap type write it 's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to it has ten variations i love the french film the red balloon great movie right i love that movie show this last one this is about balance you know it 's kind of stressful typing out so if you type on this keyboard you can like balance it out so i always say hit g and it 's going to be and i fine art pure art you know you know it 's like art is supposed to be enigmatic that 's great art does that because art is about asking questions questions that may not be answerable at it has eighty thousand samples of animal you know in rhode island if an animal gets hit on the road they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it and why do we have this facility because at risd you have to look at the actual animal the object to understand its volume to perceive it at risd you 're not allowed to draw from an image there 's something good to how things used to be done there 's something very different about it something we should figure out what is good about how we did it and i have a good friend he 's a new media artist named tota hasegawa he 's based in london no actually it 's in tokyo but when he was based in london he had a game with his wife and the game was as such when we look at an antique we want we 'll ask the shopkeeper you know i 've spent my whole career making new media art it 's about what is good how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting so art makes questions questions we aren 't a simple authoritarian regime anymore and i saw this sign that says do not walk on the grass and it was the best sign ever to say no it was like no swimming no hiking no anything my favorite ones are no plants this is work i did with my colleague becky bermont because in many senses a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes whereas a and so i sat in a sandbox for four days straight six hours every day six minute appointments with anyone in london but i would listen to people hear their issues draw in the sand try to figure things out and it was kind of hard to figure out what i was doing president i do a lot of meetings you know and by the end of the experience i realized why i was doing this and so it 's a wonderful design challenge and one thing i 've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective let me show you something i haven 't shown anywhere actually and the way it works is so for instance you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there and know that you know someone in eco and these people here are in eco the people you might engage with as ceo people how many coffees do you have how often are you you can also imagine using technology like from luminoso the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis what is of your communications"
