  "transcript": "how would you like to be better than you are suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory or maybe you 'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self confident how about living longer with good health which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that 's very good quite a few more how about fitness a few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any or is it perhaps possible the great once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz 's book on because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life every it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps twenty or different species of the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria maybe ten times more i mean think of it when antonio damasio asks about your do you think about the bacteria it 's warm it 's dark it 's moist it 's very cozy and you 're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it 's really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit but otherwise but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let 's take a step back in time fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years multi celled organisms perhaps as much as eight hundred or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last one hundred and thirty thousand the animal kingdom like a single that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoyed it now when i was i became single celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same as sexual reproduction i 've come to have increasing doubts i 've come to understand the sentiments of george burns who was performing still in las vegas well into his standing before him she looks at him and says i 'm here for super sex that 's fine says george i 'll take the soup that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not i wanted to restore health from disease i wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said i don 't want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve it through not dying it doesn 't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous vide cooked fish so what does this mean and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and i would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can 't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and as far as but there 's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility i call it the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring they 're in some cultures choosing to have more males than it 's not necessarily good for the society but it 's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or wouldn 't you if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in it cost two point seven billion dollars the year after it was finished in two thousand and four you could do the same job for twenty million dollars in three to four months today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about twenty thousand dollars and in the space of about a week it won 't be very long before the reality will be the human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what frances arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves believe it or not there 's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco will be evermore possible imagine then just but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm and the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn 't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce will also enable us to adopt why not have the quick twitch muscle why not live longer and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is develop and sooner than you may think thank you"
