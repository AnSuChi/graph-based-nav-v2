  "transcript": "sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in brooklyn a few years ago the store owned one of those machines that can print on plates but unfortunately one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters they liked but it turns out to be illegal to print a child 's drawing of micky mouse onto a plate of sugar copyright violations for children 's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the college bakery said you know what we 're getting out of that business you have to use one of our prefab images the other is called pipa sopa stands for the stop online piracy act it 's from the senate pipa is short for protectip which is itself short for preventing real online threats to economic creativity and theft of intellectual property and what sopa and pipa want to do is they want to do this they want to raise the cost now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills and then they now the problem with this model of censorship of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system and you 'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law but congress seems not to have let that bother them too much now the reason it won 't work is that you can still type so the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act you have to understand a little bit about the back story and the back story is this sopa and pipa as legislation were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century the 20th century was a great time to be a media company because the thing you really had on your side was you were making a tv show it didn 't have to be better than all other tv shows ever made it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same you got a third of the u s public for free of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn 't too terrible this is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink cassette tapes video cassette recorders even the humble xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business because it turned out we do like to consume but every time one of these new tools came along it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share and this freaked the media businesses out it freaked them out every time jack valenti who was the head lobbyist for the motion picture association of america once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to jack the ripper helpless hollywood that was the level of rhetoric and so the media industries begged insisted demanded that congress do something and congress did something by the early 90s congress passed the law that changed everything and that law was called the audio home recording act of one thousand nine hundred and ninety two taping and remixing and sharing fine let it go but that wasn 't what the media businesses wanted they had wanted congress to outlaw copying full stop so when the audio home recording act of gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment so they went for plan b it took them a while to formulate plan b plan b appeared in its first something called the digital millennium copyright act it was a complicated piece of legislation a lot of moving parts but the main thrust of the dmca was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material except that there 's no such things as uncopyable digital material it would be as ed felton once famously said like handing out water that wasn 't wet bits are copyable that 's what computers do that is a side effect of their ordinary operation order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits every dvd player and game player and television and computer you brought home no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you content and to make sure you didn 't realize or didn 't enact their capabilities as general purpose computing devices they also made it illegal for you to try to reset the copyability of that content the dmca marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to now the dmca had and is continuing to have a lot of complicated effects but in this one domain limiting sharing it has mostly not worked the fanzine that was nothing compared to what we 're seeing now with the internet we are in a world where most american citizens over the age of twelve share things with each other online and all of it horrifies those industries sopa are round two but where the dmca was surgical we want to go down into your computer we want to go down into your television set down into your game machine and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store pipa and sopa are nuclear and they 're saying we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content now the mechanism as i said for doing this and because the biggest producers of content on the internet are not google and yahoo they 're because in the end the real threat to the enactment of pipa and sopa so what pipa and sopa risk doing is taking a innocent until proven guilty and reversing it guilty until can 't share until you show us that you 're not sharing something we don 't like suddenly the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities and if it costs even a dime to police a user that will crush a service with a hundred million users so this is the imagine it says youtube and facebook because the comments can 't be policed at any acceptable cost the real effects of sopa and pipa are going to be different than the proposed effects the threat in fact is this inversion of the burden of proof where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we 're given the freedom to create to produce or to share and the people who provide those capabilities to us the youtubes the facebooks the twitters and teds are in the business of having to police us or being on the hook for contributory infringement there 's two things you can do to help stop this a simple thing call your senator what you see is that they have cumulatively received cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries you don 't have millions and millions of dollars but and you can suggest that you would prefer that the internet not be broken and if you 're not an american citizen you can contact american citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same because this seems like a national issue but it is not these industries will not be content with breaking if they break it they will break it for everybody that 's the easy thing that 's the simple thing the hard thing is this get ready sopa is simply a reversion of coica which was purposed last year which did not pass and all of this goes back to the failure of the dmca to disallow that turns out to be really inconvenient we 'd prefer not to do that says the content industries and what they want is not to have to do that they don 't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing they just want the sharing to go away they 're the next turn of this particular screw which has been going on twenty because until we convince congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with napster with youtube which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies and sopa time warner has called just consuming not producing not sharing and we should say"
