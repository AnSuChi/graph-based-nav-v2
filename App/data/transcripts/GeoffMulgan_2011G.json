  "transcript": "what i want to talk about today is one idea it 's an idea for a new kind of school which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work and it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you where it comes from is an organization called the young foundation which over many decades has come up with many innovations in education like the open university summer universities and the school of everything and about five years ago we asked what was the most important need for innovation in schooling here in the u k and we felt the most important priority was to bring together two sets of problems one was large numbers of bored teenagers who just didn 't like school couldn 't see any relationship between what they learned in school and future jobs and employers who kept complaining that the kids coming out of school weren 't actually ready for real work and looking at some of the academic research which showed the importance of what 's now called non cognitive skills the skills of motivation resilience and that these are as important as the cognitive skills formal academic skills we came up with an answer a very simple answer in a way which we called the studio and we called it a studio school to go back to the original idea of a studio in the renaissance where work and learning are integrated you work by learning and you learn by working and the design we came up with had the following characteristics first of all we wanted small schools about three hundred four hundred pupils fourteen to nineteen year olds and critically about eighty percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms but through real life practical projects working on commission to businesses ngo 's and others and all at no extra cost no selection and allowing the pupils the route into university even if many of them would want to become entrepreneurs and have manual jobs as well underlying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teenagers learn best by doing things they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real all the opposite of what mainstream schooling actually does now that was a nice idea so we moved into the rapid and perhaps most important of all two years later when the exam results came through the pupils who had been put on these field trials who were in the lowest performing groups had jumped right to the top in fact pretty much at the top decile of performance in terms of gcse 's which is the british that influenced some people to think we were onto something the minister of education down south in london described himself and the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real life work today and indeed the head of the chambers of commerce is now the chairman of the studio schools trust and helping it not just with big businesses but small businesses all over the country interestingly it 's happened almost entirely without media coverage it 's happened almost entirely without big money behind it it spread across people involved in education and it spread because of the power of an idea so the very very simple idea about turning education on its head and putting the things which were marginal things like working in teams doing practical projects and putting them right at the heart of learning rather than on the edges this is one from yorkshire where in fact my nephew i hope will be able to attend it tourism engineering and other fields but we think this is one idea which can transform the lives of thousands possibly millions of teenagers who are really bored by schooling it doesn 't animate them they 're not like all of you who can sit in rows and hear things said to you they want to do things they want to get their hands dirty they want education to be for real and my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us we feel we 're on the beginning of a journey of experiment and improvement to turn the studio school idea into something which is present not as a universal answer for every child but at least as an answer for some children in every part of the world and i hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen thank you very much"
