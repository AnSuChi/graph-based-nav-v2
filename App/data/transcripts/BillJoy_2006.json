  "transcript": "what technology can we really apply we started looking at things like death rates in the 20th how they 'd been improved and very simple things turned out you 'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water but it 's actually the opposite and so very simple things off the shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then early web would clearly make a huge difference to but i also in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies became very concerned about the potential for abuse if you think about it in history a long long time ago we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual we came up with something the ten commandments thou shalt not kill that 's we organized into cities we had many people and we came up with concepts like individual liberty and then to have to deal with large groups and we had to have mutual non aggression or through a series of we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace but now we have a new situation really what people call an asymmetric situation where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation state it 's not the nation states that have potential access to mass destruction but individuals and this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital we saw genome sequences you can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the internet if you want to and clearly someone recently i saw in a science magazine they said well the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen eighteen flu is too dangerous to fedex around if people want to use it in their labs for working on research just reconstruct it yourself because you know it might break in fedex so that this is possible to do this is not super empowered by access to these kinds of self replicating technologies whether and the danger is that they can cause roughly what 's a and we 're also not very good as a society at acting to things we don 't have direct and sort of gut level experience with so it 's not in our nature to pre act and in this case piling on more technology doesn 't solve the problem because it only people more so the solution has to be as people like russell and einstein and others imagine in a conversation that existed in a much stronger form i think early in the 20th century that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart you know public policy and moral progress the bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is and so we also have to have sensible defense because no no limitation is going to prevent a crazy person from the troubling thing is that it 's much easier to do something bad than to defend against all possible bad things so the offensive uses and then i signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this and moved into a hotel room in new york and you know nuclear bombs exploding in new york where i would be within the circle 11th and i stood in the streets with everyone and it was quite an experience to be there i got up the next morning and walked out of the city and all the sanitation trucks were parked on houston street and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away and i walked down the middle up to the train station and everything below 14th street was closed it was quite a compelling experience but not really i suppose a surprise to someone who 'd had his room full of the books it was always a surprise that that it happened then and there but it wasn 't a surprise that it happened at all and everyone then started writing about this thousands of people started writing about this and i eventually abandoned the book and then chris called me to talk at the conference i really don 't talk about this anymore because but i agreed to come and say a few things about this and i would say that we can 't give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat which is what we seem to be doing because of the present the people that are in power because that 's to give up the thing that makes so we can we can 't fight the thing with a book and i and to work through venture capital and to try to find some innovations that could address what i saw as some of these big problems you know a factor of ten difference can make a factor of one thousand difference in the outcome i it 's overwhelming at times i 'm very thankful for google and wikipedia so i can understand at least a little of what people are talking about who come through the doors but i wanted to share with you three areas that i 'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the first is this whole area of education and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $ one hundred computer and that is to say that and we 've seen and i 've had the pleasure to invest in companies that give me great confidence that we 'll extend moore 's law all the way down to roughly the ten nanometer scale another factor of say six in dimensional reduction which should give us about another factor of one hundred in raw improvement in what the chips can do and so to put that in practical terms if something costs about one thousand dollars today i think we can have that in two thousand and twenty twenty for ten dollars okay now just imagine what that $ one hundred computer will be in two thousand and twenty twenty as a tool for education i think the challenge for us is i 'm very certain that that will happen the challenge is will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device i 'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers but we don 't have very good software for them and it 's only in retrospect after the better software comes along and you take it and you run it on a ten year old machine you say god the machine was that fast i remember when they took the apple mac interface and they put it back on the apple ii the apple ii was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface we just didn 't know how to do it at the time so given that we we know and should believe because moore 's law 's been like a constant i mean it 's just been very predictable progress over the last forty years or whatever we can know what the computers are going to be like in two thousand and twenty twenty and we can give everyone in the world a $ one hundred computer or a $ ten computer in the next fifteen years the second area that i 'm focusing on is the environmental problem because that 's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world we 'll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shortly the thing that we see as the kind of moore 's law trend that 's driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is because the urban population is growing in this century from two billion to six billion in a very short amount of time people are moving to the cities they all need clean water they need energy they need transportation and we want them to develop in a green way we 're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors we 've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency but the consumer sector especially in america is very inefficient but these new materials bring such incredible innovations that there 's a strong basis for hope that these things will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market and i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered fifteen years ago if we take carbon nanotubes iijima discovered them tensile strength material known they 're very very stiff they stretch very very little in two dimensions if you make like a fabric out of them they 're thirty times stronger than kevlar they have all sorts of incredible properties if you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them they repair themselves they go zip and they repair the hole in femtoseconds which is not is really quick laughter if you shine a light if you put electricity on them they emit light you can run one thousand times more current through one of these than through a piece of metal they conduct heat along their length but not across there is no width but not in the other direction if you stack them up that 's a property of carbon fiber also if you put particles in them and they go shooting out the tip they 're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns the inside of the nanotubes is so small the smallest ones are zero point seven nanometers that it 's basically a quantum world and so we begin to see and we 've seen business plans already where the kind of things lisa randall 's talking about are in there i had one business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten 's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial so inside of so what we see is with these and other new materials that we can we can do things with different properties lighter stronger and apply these new materials to new materials that can make water new materials that can make fuel cells work better new materials that catalyze chemical reactions that cut pollution and so on ethanol the whole green dream and we 've dedicated we 've just raised a new fund we dedicated one hundred million dollars to these kinds of investments we believe that genentech the compaq the lotus the sun the netscape the amazon the google in these fields are yet to be found because this materials revolution will drive these things forward and we just announced last week we were all in new york we raised two hundred million dollars in a specialty fund and to give you an idea of the last fund that kleiner raised was a $ four hundred million fund so this for us is a very substantial over the last few months well a ray kurzweil and i wrote an op ed in the new york times about how publishing the one thousand nine hundred and eighteen eighteen genome was very dangerous and john doerr and brook and others got and you know can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps brooks told me in a break here he said he 's found so much stuff he can 't sleep because there 's so many great technologies out there we 've discovered with aids we need cocktails to to work well so that that the viral resistance we need several anti virals we need better surveillance we need networks that can find out what 's going on we need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has we need new anti virals and cocktails we need new kinds of vaccines vaccines that are broad spectrum vaccines that we can manufacture quickly cocktails more polyvalent vaccines get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains we need we don 't know where this thing is going we have a chance to help really and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of one thousand so we 're very excited because we think we can fund ten or speed up ten projects and see them come to market in the next couple years does that solve the larger problem that i was talking about in the wired article and i 'm afraid the answer is really no because you can 't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology if we let an unlimited amount of power loose million to one disadvantage so what we need to do is we need better and for example some things we could do that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now but perhaps with the change of administration would be use markets markets are a very strong force for example rather than trying to regulate away problems which probably won 't work if we could price into the cost of doing business the cost of catastrophe so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk so if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on but it wouldn 't have to be approved by regulators you 'd have to convince an actuary and if you apply the notion of insurance more more broadly you can use a more powerful force a market force to provide feedback how could you keep the law i think the law would be a really good thing to keep well you have to hold people and finally i think we have to do something that 's but we can steer so we can we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen and steer us to a vice president gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory into a lower probability of catastrophic risk"
