  "transcript": "what i want to talk about is as background is the idea that cars are art this is actually quite meaningful to to me because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole we don 't do coffee coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it and cars are thought so much as a product that it 's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side and so cars as art brings it into an emotional plane if you accept that this is completely and they 're not very emotional they solve a purpose and certainly automobiles have been around for one hundred years and have made our lives functionally because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve we have to solve the pollution we have to solve the congestion but that 's not what interests me in this speech what interests me in this speech is and as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and i believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like bmw is really hip on and lots of other things then i think we can look past that and try and understand why hook is in many of us of this car y ness and what that means what we can learn from it that 's what i want to get to cars are not a suit of clothes cars are an avatar cars are an expansion of yourself they and if you 're full of road you 've got a chevy like a rock right cars are a sculpture did you know this that every car you see out there is sculpted by hand but the originals are all done by hand it 's done by by men and women and they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum that tension between the need to express then you put something new into it and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship and that tension that discovery that push for something new and at the same time that sense of obligation to the regards of craftsmanship which hasn 't changed much since michelangelo started screwing around with it and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too real quickly there we go the automobile that was one hundred years right there did you catch that and that one there it changed a lot didn 't it ok it but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here i want to talk about this and it 's done by men now this little quote about sculpture from henry moore we are completely infected and beauty can be the result of this infectiousness it 's quite wonderful this sculpture is of course at the heart of all of it and it 's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars and it 's not a whole lot different really when they 're working like this or when somebody works like this it 's that same kind of commitment that same kind of beauty now now i get to the point i we are really trying to find that truth out there however engineers tend to look at things a little bit more instead of this quantum approach we 're dealing with irrationalisms and we 're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four and if you get four point zero it 's better and four point zero is even better and that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence men men men it 's engineers and we 're kind of the female side to that that 's ok that 's cool you go off and be manly we 're going to be a little bit more female because what we 're interested in is finding form that 's more than just a and i think this idea of soul as being at the heart of great cars i discovered something about love and design and say you know you could take the word love out of a lot of things in our society put the word design in and it still works like this quote here you know it you can understand that it works in truisms all is fair in design and war this is like you know this is like puppy love you know this is cool right it really only gets serious when you look at something like this ok this is one substitution that i believe all of us in design management are guilty of more to design when it gets down to your neighbor your it can be physical like this and maybe in the future it will be but right now it 's in dealing with our own people our own teams who are doing the creating so to my story the idea of we have to have a shared intimacy a shared vision that means we have to work as one family we have to understand ourselves that way there 's good times there 's interesting times and there 's some stress times too you want to do cars you 've got to go outside you 've got to do cars in the snow that 's by the way is a presentation we made to our board of directors we haul their butts out in the snow too you want to know cars outside well you 've got to stand outside to do this and because these are artists they have very artistic temperaments all and art is discovering yourself through your art we are completely in love with our own creations this is one of my favorite paintings it really describes our relationship with cars this is sick beyond belief but the intimacy with which we work together as a team we have a shared center we have a shared focus and it 's my job in the competitive process to narrow this down i heard today about about joseph 's death genes that have to go in and kill cell reproduction you know that 's what i have to do sometimes we start out with ten cars we narrow it down to five cars down to and i 'm in the middle of that this is very difficult and you have to have a bond with your team and they want that to live more than we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it that i only had a phone number that connected me to them staff of artists that are just your wrist we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers this is one thousand nine hundred and ninety six we did this project and so we sent them off now many people know deep blue from ibm we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our faxes they 'd think we 're talking about computers it turned out it was quite clever because like i said i just had a phone number that connected me to them and a group of engineers and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what 's the successor to the suv they would come together compare come together and they would produce together a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn 't pollute each other 's ideas but at the same time came together and resolved the problems so they went other places all i got was postcards and i 'm telling myself this is going to be a great car they 're doing research that i and who 'd left their some had left their wives behind and families behind and one of the young women in the project she was a fantastic lady she built the bed over the bathtub it 's quite fascinating so my concept of what a design studio was probably i wasn 't up to speed on where these guys were however the engineers back in in munich had taken on this kind of newtonian solution and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin and you know and one was hoping that these two teams would get together and this collusion of incredible creativity under these incredible surroundings and these incredibly stressed out engineers would create some i didn 't know was and what we found out was these guys they can 't even like talk to each other under those conditions you get a divergence of newtonian and quantum thinking at that point you have a split that they cannot bring this together at all and and the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to dr goschel who is now my boss and at that time he was co mentor on the project we would see where we were going we would see the first indication of what could be the successive phenomenon to the suv in america and so i had these ideas in my head that this is going to be great i mean i 'm going to see so much work it 's so intense i know probably las vegas meant a lot about it after three months and the team had gotten together the week before many days ahead of time the engineers flew over and designers got together it turns out that and they hadn 't done anything because and we were asking them to create a problem now help us solve it and the engineers told the designers if you go in with all your stuff we 'll walk out we 'll walk right out of the project and we got a presentation that had an agenda looked like this there was a whole lot of we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers and here i 'm expecting at any moment ok they 're going to turn the page and i 'm going to see the cars i 'm going to see the sketches i 'm going to see maybe some idea of where it 's going and if you can imagine what this is like to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working and they 're out there spending all this money and they 're learning and they 're doing all this stuff i went fucking ballistic right i went nuts you can probably remember tiburon it used to look like this i yelled at them what the hell are you doing you 're supposed to be the creative ones what the hell is going on around here it was probably one of my better tirades i have some good ones but this was probably one of my better ones and i went into these people how could they take bmw 's money how could they because of course they didn 't tell us that they had because they had shown solidarity with the engineers and they 'd decided not to show me anything in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start because they hadn 't realized of course that so we went to lunch and the engineers all sat at one end of the table the really quiet did she fly out with me or something i said no and he said love does not mean counting how many times i say ' i love you ' it doesn 't mean so that means you don 't love me as much love is not selfish and i thought you know i 'm not showing love here i 'm seriously and to me that 's my quantification method for qualifying a team this cannot be i can 't have a relationship with you guys because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them not being able to show me what i wanted and merely having to ask me to trust and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about truly back into the by the way that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after suvs in america one of those was the x coupe they had a lot of fun with that it was the rendition of our motorcycle the gs as carl magnusson in conclusion my lesson that i wanted to pass on to you was this one here i 'm also going to steal a little quote out of little prince there 's a lot to be said about trust if you know that those two words are synonymous for design and i hope that that you too find that there 's more to design thanks so much"
