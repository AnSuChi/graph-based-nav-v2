  "transcript": "a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do it 's a woodworking machine or at least a piece of one unfortunately not very long afterwards the company went out of business and now of course the whole technology now i 'm a fairly slow learner but eventually it occurred to me that maybe what passed for design wasn 't all that important making them more marketable by focusing on a maybe just a single product i was being incremental and in fact really emerged in the latter half of the 20th century so when we talk about design today and particularly when we read about it in the popular press we 're often talking about products like these amusing yes important not so very and i 'd like to suggest that if we take a different view of design and focus less on the object including the clifton suspension bridge in bristol and the thames tunnel at rotherhithe both great designs and actually very innovative too his greatest creation and one of my favorite things to do was to cycle along by the side of the railway waiting for the great big express trains to roar past you can see it represented here in j m w turner 's painting rain steam and speed now what brunel said that he wanted to achieve and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made which meant building long viaducts across river valleys this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead and long tunnels but he didn 't stop there he didn 't stop with just trying to design the best railway journey he imagined an integrated transportation system in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark on a train in london and disembark from a ship in new york one journey from london to new york now brunel was working one hundred years before the emergence of the design but i think he was using design thinking now design thinking begins with what roger martin the business school professor at the university of toronto calls integrative thinking and that 's the ability to exploit opposing ideas and opposing constraints to create new solutions in the case of and economic viability we went from this to this systems systems thinkers who were reinventing the world to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things as our industrial society matured so design became a profession image and fashion now i 'm not trying to throw stones here i 'm a fully paid up member of that priesthood and somewhere in here i have my designer glasses and that 's happening through the application of design thinking to new kinds of problems and as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems are some basic ideas that i think we can observe that are useful and i 'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes the first of those is that design is human centered or might need what makes life easier more enjoyable what makes technology useful and usable more than simply good ergonomics putting the buttons in the right place they wanted to understand what the aspirations and motivations were of these school children to understand how they might play a role in screening their parents conversion sound has developed a high quality ultra low cost digital hearing aid for the developing world now in the west so it took a team working in india with patients and community health workers to understand how a a pda and an application on a pda might replace those technicians in a fitting and diagnostic service so if human need is the place to start then design thinking rapidly moves on to learning by making instead of thinking about what to build building in order to think they do an incredible job of serving very poor patients by taking the revenues from those who can afford but they are also very innovative what really impressed me was their willingness to prototype their ideas very early this is the manufacturing facility for one of their because they brought the cost down partly they did this by instead of building a they used the basement of one of their hospitals and instead of installing the large scale machines they used low cost cad cam prototyping technology they so if human need is the place to start and prototyping a vehicle for progress then there are also some questions to ask about the destination instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation the shift from a passive relationship between consumer and producer to the active engagement of everyone in experiences that are meaningful productive and profitable so i 'd like to take the idea that rory sutherland talked about this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things and take that a little bit further and say that i think the design of participatory systems in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured so william beveridge when he wrote the first of his famous reports created what became britain 's welfare state in which he hoped that every citizen would be an active participant in their own social well being he confessed that he had failed and instead had created a society of welfare they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state so in one of their projects called southwark circle they worked with residents in southwark south london and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks designs were refined we can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it 's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone nurses and practitioners at u s healthcare system and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge and change shift through a program of brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping they 've developed a completely new way to change shift they went from retreating to the nurse 's station to discuss the various states and needs of patients to developing a system that happened on the ward in front of patients using a simple software tool they increased patient confidence and nurse happiness when you multiply that and this is just one of thousands so these are just some of the kind of basic ideas around design thinking and some of the new kinds of projects that they 're being applied to new ideas now brunel worked at the height of the industrial revolution when all of life and our economy was being reinvented now how we educate ourselves how we keep instead of it encourages us to take a divergent approach to explore new alternatives new solutions new ideas that have not existed before and that is what is the question that we 're trying to answer now brunel may have asked a question like this how do i take a train from london to new york so these are some that we 've been and one in particular is one that we 're working on with the acumen fund in a project that 's been funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation how might we improve access to safe drinking water for the world 's poorest people and at the same time stimulate innovation amongst local water providers so instead of having a bunch of american designers come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate we took a sort of more open we hosted a competition and then funded five of those organizations so they developed and iterated these ideas and then ideo and acumen spent several weeks working with them to help design new social marketing campaigns community outreach strategies business models new water vessels for storing water and carts for delivering water so for me this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career that by focusing on the needs of humans and by using prototypes to move ideas along quickly by getting the process out of the hands of designers so that 's one thing that we 've been working on i 'm actually really quite interested and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on what kinds of questions do do we think design thinking could be used to tackle and if you 've got any ideas then and and of course you can search to find the questions that you 're interested in by using the same hash code"
