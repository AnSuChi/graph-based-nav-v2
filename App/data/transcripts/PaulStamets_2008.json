  "transcript": "love a challenge and saving the earth is probably a good one i often wondered if there was a united organization of organisms otherwise known as i want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions using fungi and these solutions are based on mycelium the mycelium infuses all landscapes it holds soils together it 's extremely tenacious this holds up to thirty thousand times its mass they 're they generate the humus soils across the landmasses of earth multi directional transfer of nutrients between plants mitigated by the mcyelium so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks cedars and douglas firs dusty and i we like to say on sunday this is where we go to church i 'm in love with the old growth forest and i 'm a patriotic american because we have those and frankly i face a big obstacle when i mention mushrooms to somebody they immediately think portobellos or magic mushrooms their eyes glaze over and they think i 'm a little crazy so i hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group the irrational fear when it comes to fungi mushrooms are very fast in their growth day twenty one day twenty three day twenty five mushrooms produce strong antibiotics in fact we 're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom a group of twenty eukaryotic microbiologists published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta and so our best antibiotics come but here is a mushroom that 's past its prime after they sporulate they do rot but i propose to you that the sequence of microbes that occur on rotting mushrooms are essential for the health of the forest they give rise to the trees they create the debris fields that and the mycelium forms and goes underground this is and when i 'm staring we exhale carbon dioxide so does mycelium it inhales oxygen just like we do but these are essentially externalized stomachs and i and so the spongy soil not only resists erosion but sets up a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms 1990s that mycelium is earth 's natural internet when you look at the mycelium they 're highly branched and if there 's one branch that that is broken then very quickly because of the nodes of crossing internet engineers maybe call them hot points alternative pathways for channeling nutrients it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris so i believe the invention of the computer internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously and we now being the top organism on this planet are trying to allocate resources in order to to protect the biosphere i believe matter begets life life becomes single cells single cells become strings strings become chains chains network and this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe most of you may not know that fungi were the first organisms to come to land they came to land one point three billion years ago how is that possible it pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together so fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates and all sorts of other oxalates are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix four hundred and twenty million years ago it was called prototaxites the tallest plants on earth at that time were less than two feet published an article in the journal of geology this past year determining that prototaxites was a giant fungus a giant mushroom across the landscapes of earth were dotted these giant mushrooms and these existed for tens of millions of years and as we march forward sixty five million years ago most of you know about it we had an asteroid impact the earth was struck by an asteroid a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere sunlight was cut off and fungi inherited the earth because fungi do not need light more recently at einstein university they just just determined that fungi use radiation as a as a source of energy much like plants use light the largest organism in the world is in eastern oregon two hundred acres in size two how is it that this organism whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us the mycelium in the right conditions produces a mushroom it bursts through with such ferocity battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham washington there were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste one was a control pile one pile was treated with enzymes one pile the mycelium absorbs the oil the mycelium is producing the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons they sporulated the spores attract insects the insects laid eggs eggs whereas the other three piles were dead and the pah 's the aromatic hydrocarbons went from ten thousand parts per million to less than two hundred in eight weeks the last image we don 't have the entire pile was a green berm of life these are gateway species vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities so i invented burlap sacks bunker spawn and putting the mycelium using storm blown debris e coli or other wastes or a factory with chemical toxins and it leads to habitat restoration and i 'll show you and ten to the third power is around one thousand in forty eight hours to seventy two hours these three mushroom species reduced the amount of coliform bacteria ten thousand times think of the implications this is a space conservative method that uses storm debris and we can guarantee that we will have storms every agarikon it 's a mushroom exclusive to the old growth forest that dioscorides first described in sixty five a d as a treatment against consumption this mushroom grows in washington state oregon northern california british columbia now thought to be extinct in europe may not seem that large is extremely rare fungus old growth forest i think is absolutely critical for human health i we submitted over three hundred samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms that were highly active against poxviruses dr earl kern who 's a smallpox expert of the u s defense department states that any compounds that have a selectivity index of two or more are active ten or greater are considered to be very active our mushroom strains were in the highly active range there 's a vetted press release that you can read it 's vetted by dod if you and so for the first time i am showing this we have three different strains of agarikon mushrooms highly active against flu viruses here 's the selectivity index 20s now against flu viruses compared to the ribavirin controls we have an extraordinarily high activity and we 're using a natural extract within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical we tried it against flu a viruses as well as flu b viruses so then we tried i then think that we can make the argument that we should save the old growth forest as a matter of national defense i became interested in entomopathogenic fungi fungi that kill insects i was able to morph the culture industry has spent over one hundred million dollars specifically on on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house and the ants were and then a delicate dance between they become mummified and boing a mushroom pops out of their head now after sporulation the spores repel of termites i received my first patent against carpenter ants termites and fire ants i then received my second patent and this is a big one it 's been called an alexander graham bell patent it covers over hundred thousand species this is the most disruptive technology i 've been told by executives of the pesticide industry that they have ever witnessed this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world the life box you 're gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores like of the agarikon mushroom the seeds then are mothered and the use of cardboard around the world so they become ecological footprints if there 's a youtube like and through satellite imaging systems through virtual earth or google earth you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through life boxes you could add water i developed this for refugee community corns beans and squash and onions i took several containers my wife said if i could do this anybody could and i ended up growing a seed garden then you harvest the seeds for your help on this and then i inoculate the corncobs and so this population will be shut down but watch what happens here but and so i thought and we came up with econol"
