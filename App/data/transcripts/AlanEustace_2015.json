  "transcript": "we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by behind me you see an amazing view a picture that was taken from the and it shows a portion of our planet that 's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored that place is called the stratosphere it gets colder and colder and colder until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere and then an amazing thing happens it gets colder at a much slower rate and then it starts warming up and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection and then you end up getting colder and colder and that 's the top of the stratosphere one of the least accessible places on our planet most often when it 's visited it 's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound and they get a few seconds on the way up and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in is it possible to experience the stratosphere is it possible to explore the stratosphere i studied this using my favorite search engine for and then i made a scary phone call it was a reference from a friend of mine to call taber maccallum from paragon space development corporation and i asked him the question is it possible to build and he said it was and after a period of about three years we proceeded to do just that and on october twenty four of last year i went up in a balloon to one hundred and eight hundred and ninety feet but who 's counting came back to earth at speeds of up to eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour it was a four minute and and when i got to ten thousand feet i opened a parachute and i landed and more than that come down tomorrow and let 's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it you have a three years later this is what we have we 've got an amazing suit that was made by ilc dover ilc dover was the company that made all of the apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits they had never sold a suit commercially but they sold one to me which i am very grateful for up here we have a parachute this all about safety everyone on the team knew that i have a wife and two small children ten and fifteen so there 's a main parachute and a reserve parachute and if i do nothing the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device the suit itself can protect me from the it has two redundant oxygen tanks even if i was to get a quarter inch hole in this suit which is extremely unlikely this system would still protect me from the so the system weighs about and it weighed about three thousand pounds and to raise three thousand pounds to an altitude of one hundred and thirty five thousand feet which was my target altitude it would have taken a to fifty million cubic feet because i only weighed five hundred pounds in this system we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler so with that i want to take you to roswell new mexico on october twenty four we had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night and this is using the front loader that you 'll see in a second and i want to play you a video especially when you 're going to land seventy miles away i 've already spent about an hour and a half a half pre breathing and then here you see the suit going on it takes about an hour to get the suit on astronauts get this really nice van to go to the launch pad but i got a front loader you can see the top you can see the balloon that 's where the helium is this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for fifteen miles and there we go that 's me waving with my left hand the reason i 'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway my team forbade me from using my right hand so the trip up is beautiful it 's kind of like google earth in reverse it took two hours and seven minutes to go up and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes i was mostly trying to relax my heart rate was very low and i was trying not to use very much oxygen it 's interesting here because if you look i 'm right over the airport and i 'm probably at fifty thousand feet but immediately i 'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over one hundred and twenty miles an hour and i was about four thousand feet from release this is what it looks like you can see the darkness of space the curvature of the earth the i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now goes wrong i want to be ready and the main thing that i want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable and there you can see a drogue parachute which i 'll demonstrate in just a second because that 's really important there 's the balloon going by a second time and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get eight hundred and twenty two miles an hour down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there at this point i 'm very happy that there 's a parachute out i thought i was the only one happy but it turns out mission control was really happy as well and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me he was my wingman on the descent this is my landing but it 's probably more properly called a crash i hate to admit it but this wasn 't even close to my worst landing but one the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release and what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me but the problem with one of these things or you can release this drogue late but the guys at united parachute this pipe is so solid and that prevented a very serious so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people the core of this was about twenty people and it was a chance to work with the best experts in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology and environmental systems and high altitude medicine it was fantastic it 's an engineer 's dream to work with that group of people and i also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at google both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that i was away but there 's one other group i wanted to thank and that 's my family yay i would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology and they weren 't hearing any of it it was super hard on them and the only reason that my wife put up with it was because i came back incredibly happy after each of the two hundred and fifty tests my 15 year old she and i were in the car and we were driving down and she had this idea and she goes dad i 've got this idea and so i listened to her idea and i said katelyn that 's impossible and she looks at me and she goes dad after what you just did how can you call anything impossible and i said ok it 's not impossible it 's just very very hard and then i paused for a second and i said it 's just that i don 't know how to do it"
