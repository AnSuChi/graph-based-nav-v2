  "transcript": "requires laying out in excruciating detail every single step that you want the computer to do in order to achieve your goal goal so this was the challenge faced by this man arthur samuel in one thousand nine how can you write a program lay out in excruciating detail and in fact by one thousand nine hundred and sixty two this computer had beaten the connecticut state champion so arthur samuel was the father of machine learning and i have a great debt to him because i am a machine learning practitioner i was the president of kaggle a community of over two hundred thousand machine learning google showed that it is possible to find information movies that you companies like linkedin and facebook sometimes will tell you about who your friends might be and you have no idea how it did it this is also how ibm was successful in getting watson to beat the two world champions at jeopardy answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one but with machine learning this is now possible and in fact this car has driven over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads can learn and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes don 't know how to do ourselves or maybe can do them better than us one of the most amazing examples i 've seen of machine learning happened on a project that i ran at kaggle where a team run by a guy called geoffrey hinton from the university of toronto won a competition for automatic drug discovery now what was extraordinary here is not just that they beat all of the algorithms developed by merck or the international academic community but nobody on the team had any background in chemistry or biology or life sciences and they did it in two weeks how did they do this they used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning this is geoffrey hinton here on the and as a result it 's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do the more data you give it and the more computation time you give it the better it gets the new york times also showed in this article another extraordinary result of deep learning which i 'm going to show you now it shows that computers can take in this process is to actually speak to you in chinese now the key thing there is we 've been able to take a large amount of information from many chinese speakers and produce a text to speech system that takes chinese text and converts it into chinese language hour or so of my own voice and we 've used that to modulate the standard text to speech system so that it would sound like me that was at a machine learning conference in china although of course sometimes at tedx conferences feel free everything you saw there was happening with deep learning the translation to chinese and the text in the top right deep learning and the construction of the voice was deep learning as well and i discovered that a year earlier it had also learned to see in this obscure competition from germany called the german traffic sign recognition benchmark deep learning had learned to recognize traffic signs like this since that time a lot has happened in two thousand and twelve google announced that they had a deep learning algorithm watch youtube videos and crunched the data on sixteen thousand computers for a month and humans don 't learn by being told what they see but by learning for themselves what these things are imagenet looking to try to figure out from one and a half million images what they 're pictures of again so machines really are doing an extraordinarily good google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in france and what you see here in the top left is an example of a picture that i uploaded to baidu 's deep learning system and underneath you can see that the system has even some with their tongue out so we now have computers which really understand what they see and can therefore search databases of so what does it mean now that computers can see well in fact deep learning has done more than that complex nuanced sentences like this one are now understandable with deep learning algorithms as you can see here this stanford based system showing the red dot at the top has figured out that this sentence is expressing negative sentiment now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things again at about native chinese speaker level using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this even compared to native human understanding this is a system and as i 'm typing in here sentences in real time it 's understanding so you can see it 's actually understanding my sentences and actually understanding these pictures perhaps not surprising now that i 'm going to tell you they can write and here is some text that an algorithm out of stanford generated each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures it 's seen a man before it 's seen black before it 's seen a guitar before humans prefer the so we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities for example in medicine a team in boston announced that they had discovered dozens of new clinically relevant features of tumors which help doctors make a prognosis of a cancer in stanford a group there announced that looking at tissues under magnification in both of these cases not only were the predictions more accurate but they generated new insightful science in the radiology case they were new clinical indicators that humans can understand in this pathology case the computer system actually discovered that the cells this is an example of identifying cancerous areas of human tissue under a microscope the system being shown here can identify those areas more accurately or about as accurately as human pathologists but was built entirely with deep learning using no medical expertise by people who have no background in the field we can now segment neurons about as accurately as humans can but this system was developed with deep learning using people with no previous background in medicine as somebody with no previous background in medicine i seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company which i did i was kind of terrified of doing it but the theory seemed to suggest that it ought to be possible to do very useful medicine and thankfully the feedback has been fantastic not just from the media but from the medical community who have been very supportive the theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible leaving doctors to do what they 're best at it now takes us about fifteen minutes to generate a new medical diagnostic test and i 'll show you that in real time now but i 've compressed it down to three minutes by cutting some pieces out rather than showing you creating a medical and i want to create something that can split them into the angle of the photo that 's being taken so i have to start from scratch with our deep learning so the human as you can see here is telling the computer about areas of interest which it it wants the computer then to try and use to improve its algorithm now these deep learning systems actually are in and when it does so successfully the human who is driving so as we go through this process we 're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we 're looking for or a manually selecting these fronts as opposed to the backs then telling the computer this is a type of and then we train the machine learning algorithm based on these couple of hundred things and we hope that it 's gotten a lot better you can see it 's now started to fade some of these pictures out showing us that it already is recognizing how to understand some of these itself and using similar images you can now see the computer at this point is able to entirely find just the fronts of cars so at this even at this point it 's still difficult to separate out groups in this case even after we so we can again give the computer some hints and we say okay try and find a projection that separates out the left sides and the right sides as much as possible using this deep learning algorithm so this is a case not where the human is being replaced by a computer but where they 're working together what we 're doing here is we 're replacing something that used to take a team of five so and at this point we can start to quite quickly check through them to make sure that there 's no mistakes where there are mistakes we can let the computer know about them and using this kind of process for each of the different groups we are now up to an eighty percent success rate in classifying the one point five million images and trying to understand and using that approach by fifteen minutes we get to ninety seven percent classification rates so this kind of technique could allow us to fix a major problem which is that there 's a lack of medical expertise in the world the world economic forum says that there 's between a 10x and of physicians in the developing world and it would take about three hundred years to train enough people so imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches so i 'm very excited about the the problem here is that every area in blue on this map is somewhere where services are over eighty percent of employment what are services these are services so eighty percent of the world 's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do what does that mean well it 'll be fine they 'll be replaced by other jobs for example there will be more jobs for data scientists so if you think oh it 's all happened before it 's very hard for us to estimate so currently we see the things around us and we say oh computers are still pretty dumb so we need to be starting to think about this capability right now we have seen this once before of course in the industrial the thing is though that after a while things flattened out there was social disruption but once engines were used to generate power in all the situations things really settled down because the machine labor productivity has been in fact even a little bit down"
