  "transcript": "surrounded by police loyal to the government as the square is known prepared for battle stockpiling homemade weapons and mass producing improvised body armor viktor yanukovych rejected a far reaching accord with the european union in favor of stronger ties with russia in response tens of thousands of dissatisfied citizens poured into central kiev to demonstrate against this allegiance there i photographed the fighters against a black a curtain that obscured the highly seductive and visual backdrop ice and smoke i was free from the oleg vasiliy and maxim i say the word costume because these were not clothes that had been issued or coordinated by anyone they were improvised uniforms made up irregular combat fatigues and trophies taken from the police i became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves this using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter old fashioned it gives me time to speak with each person while they look back at me rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on february twenty snipers loyal to the government started firing on the civilians and many were killed in a very short space of time and there was blood all over the pavements the following day president yanukovych fled ukraine in all three months of protests resulted in more than one hundred and twenty confirmed dead and many more missing as the days passed in kiev 's central square streams of armed fighters were joined by tens of thousands of ordinary people filling the streets in an act of collective mourning many were women who often carried flowers that they had i stopped women as they approached the barricades to lay their tributes and asked to make their picture most women there had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point and the color of their pastel coats their shiny handbags and the bunches of red carnations white tulips and yellow roses that they carried it is clear to me that these two sets of pictures don 't make much sense without the other they are about men and women and the way we are not the way we look but the way we are and not only in ukraine men fight most wars then the women showed the implications of such violence"
