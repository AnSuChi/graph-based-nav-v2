  "transcript": "fifteen years ago i went to visit a friend in hong kong and at the time i was very superstitious so upon landing this was still at the old hong kong airport that 's kai tak in the middle of the city i 'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks and if i see something negative i 'm going to be miserable indeed so the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard and it turned out that i just went to see you know what they are doing in hong kong but packed my week later i was again on my way to hong kong still superstitions and thinking well if that ' winner ' billboard is still up i 'm going to have a good time working here laughter but if it 's gone it 's going to be really miserable and stressful so it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it on the other hand it also taught me where superstition gets me because i really had a terrible time in hong kong laughter however i did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life i think what the conference brochure refers to as moments that take your breath away and since i 'm a big list maker i actually listed them all now you don 't have to go through the trouble of reading them and i won 't read them for you i know that it 's incredibly boring to hear about other people 's happinesses is i actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design and very surprisingly over half of them had actually something to do with design two different possibilities there 's one from a consumer 's point of view where i was happy while experiencing design and i 'll just give you one example i had gotten my first walkman this is one thousand nine hundred and eighty three my brother had this great yamaha and the police 's synchronicity cassette had just been and there was no helmet law in my hometown of bregenz so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new sony walkman and i remember it as a true moment of happiness you know of course they are related to this combination you know design objects situated somewhere here right in there between delight and bliss now there is the other part from a designer 's standpoint if you 're happy while actually doing it and one way to see how happy designers are when they 're designing could be to look at the authors ' photos on the back of their monographs so according to this the australians and the japanese as well as the mexicans are very happy a museum opened in tokyo called the mori museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor and their inaugural exhibit with an eye on this conference and they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different under arcadia they showed things like this from the edo period a hundred ways to write happiness in under nirvana they showed this constable painting and there was a little an interesting theory about abstraction this is a and the theory was that they showed these shunsho paintings also from the edo period ink on silk now what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness and i felt a little bit cheated because the visualization that 's a really my studio a book a happy dog and you take it out it 's an aggressive dog it 's a happy david byrne and an angry david byrne or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face you know that 's not a big deal to accomplish within advertising or within the movie industry happy has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually do it from a cynical point of view this is you know the movie poster designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has very much a dark side to it much much more difficult is this where the designs actually can evoke happiness and i 'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me this is a campaign done by a a young artist in new york who calls himself true everybody who has ridden the new york subway system will be familiar true met every wednesday at a subway stop with twenty of his friends they divided up the different subway lines and added their own version so this is one now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs so you 're you 're really bored in the subway and you kind of stare at something and it takes you a while until it actually you realize that this says something different than what it normally says laughter i mean that 's at least how it made me happy real humanitarian he didn 't want any of his friends to be arrested so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card and also gave this fake letter from the mta to everybody sort of like pretending that it 's an art project financed by the this is at p s one a sculpture that 's basically a square room by james turrell that has a retractable ceiling opens up and the room is truly something to be seen people 's demeanor changes when they go in there and for sure i haven 't looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there i would definitely say that observing a couple of years ago in manhattan and he took it upon himself to print fifty five thousand speech bubbles empty speech bubbles stickers large ones and small ones and he goes around new york and just puts them empty as they are on posters go and fill them in this one says please let me die in peace i think that was was this is on a musician poster that says am concerned that my cd will not sell more than two hundred thousand units and that as a result my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me after which my contract will be cancelled and i 'll be back doing journey covers on bleecker street jee gets to have his project the public gets a sweeter environment and different public gets a place to express the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads that was on my mind for a while can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i don 't like to just to see what i actually like about my job you know one is just working without pressure then working concentrated without being frazzled or as nancy said before like really immerse oneself into it try not to get stuck getting out of the studio you know work on things where the content is actually important for me and and then i found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that i thought i learned in my life so far and and so i just picked one of the things that i thought i learned in this case everything i do always comes back to me and we made these spreads right out of this so company asked us to design five billboards for them again we could supply the content for it so i just picked another one and this was two weeks ago we flew to arizona the designer who works with me and myself and photographed this one so this is again for a magazine dividing pages this is from the front then it 's guts again then it 's"
