  "transcript": "among all the diseases that existed in this land it was the worst it killed the most children and along came a brilliant inventor a scientist who came up with a partial cure for that disease many children still died but and one of the good things about this this cure was that and was very easy to use but the worst thing about it was that you couldn 't use it on the youngest children on but building on the invention of the first one and the beauty of the second cure for this disease was that it could be used on infants and one year olds and the problem with this cure was it was very expensive and it was very complicated to use and although parents tried as hard as they could to use it properly almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end zero year olds and the one year olds and they kept on using the existing cure that they had on the two year olds and up and this went on for quite some time people were happy they had their two cures until a particular mother whose child had just turned two died of this disease and she thought to herself my child just turned two and until the child turned two i had always used this complicated expensive cure you know this treatment and then the child turned two and i started using the cheap and easy treatment and i wonder and she wondered like all parents who lose children if there isn 't something that i could have done like keep on using that complicated expensive cure and she told all the other people and she said how could it possibly be that something that 's cheap and simple works as well as something that 's complicated and expensive and the people thought you know you 're right it probably is the wrong thing to do to switch and use the cheap and simple solution and the government they heard her story you 're right we should make a law we should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment and not let anybody use this on their children they were satisfied for many years this went along and everything was fine but and he used the expensive and complicated treatment but he knew about the cheap and simple one and he thought about it so maybe i should go and look at the data and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment actually works any better than the cheap and simple one he found that it didn 't look like the expensive complicated solution was any better than the cheap one at least for the children who were two and older the and so he went forth to the people and he said i 've made this wonderful finding it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution and by doing so we could save ourselves three hundred million dollars a year and we could spend that on our children in other ways and the parents were very unhappy this is a terrible thing because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing and in particular the people who made this expensive solution were very upset because they thought how can we hope to compete with something that 's essentially free we would lose all of our market and he decided that maybe he should leave the country for a few days and seek out some more intelligent anyway here i am it 's not a fairy tale and the disease i 'm referring to is actually and the expensive cure that for for children two years old and up there really is no no real benefit proven benefit of car seats in spite of the the incredible energy that has been devoted toward expanding the laws and making it socially unacceptable to put your children into seatbelts and then finally talk a little bit about about a third way about another technology which is probably better than anything we have but which there hasn 't been any enthusiasm for adoption precisely because people are so enamored with the current car seat solution case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats so the united states keeps a data set of every fatal accident that 's happened since so in every car crash in which at least one person dies they have information on all of the people so if you look at that data it 's right up on the the national highway transportation safety administration 's website you can just look at the raw data and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence that 's in favor of car seats for six year olds anyone above six basically no one uses car seats so you can 't compare twenty nine point three percent of the children if they 're wearing a lap and shoulder belt in this raw data nineteen point four percent and actually the theory tells you that the lap only seatbelt 's got to be worse so what we do in the study is and this is just presenting the same information but turned into a figure to make it easier so the yellow bar represents the orange bar lap and shoulder and the red bar lap only seatbelts and this is all relative to unrestrained the bigger the bar the better okay so this is the data i just showed so you can control for the basic things like how hard the crash was what seat the child was sitting in etc the age of the child and that 's that middle set of bars and so you can see that the which are really controlling for everything you could possibly imagine about the crash fifty seventy five one hundred different characteristics of the crash and and the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates and it 's not it 's very robust to anything you want to look at one thing that 's interesting if you look at frontal impact crashes when the car crashes the front hits into something and i think this isn 't just chance in order to have the car seat approved you need to pass certain federal indeed the car seats don 't perform as well and i think that 's because they 've been optimized to pass as we always expect people to do to optimize relative to bright line rules and so if we look at recent crashes in the recent crashes the new car seats are far far better but indeed in recent crashes they say well that 's impossible that can 't be and the line of argument if you ask parents is how could they possibly not work better than seatbelts because they are so expensive and complicated of an interesting logic i think that people use the government wouldn 't have told us [ to ] use them if they weren 't much better but what 's interesting is the government telling us to use them is not actually based on very much it really is based on some impassioned pleas of parents whose children died after they turned two in telling your story by using these abstract statistics and so i had some friends over to dinner and i was asking we had a cookout i was asking them what what advice they might have for me about about proving my point they said why don 't you run some crash tests and i said that 's a great idea so we actually tried to commission some crash tests and it turns as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country some explicitly some not so explicitly all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers we can 't risk alienating them by testing seatbelts relative to car seats now eventually one did under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do this test for us so anonymity and one thousand five hundred dollars per seat that we crashed and so we went to buffalo new york and here is the the precursor to it these are the and then here 's how the crash test works here they don 't actually crash the entire car you know it 's not worth ruining a whole car to do it so they just have these bench seats and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it so i just wanted you to look at this and i think this gives you a good idea of why parents think car seats are so great look at the kid in the car seat does he not look content ready to go like he could survive it 's so here this is the car seat now watch two things watch how the head goes forward and basically hits the knees and this is in the car seat and watch how the car seat flies around bear in mind there are two things about this this is a car seat that was installed by someone who has installed one thousand car seats who knew exactly how to do it and also it turned out these bench seats are the very best way and ok so that kid in this crash fared very well the federal standards are that you have to score below a one thousand to be an approved car seat on this crash in some some metric so the next one now this is the kid same crash who is in the seatbelt he hardly moves at all actually relative to the other child the funny thing is the cam work is terrible because they 've only set it up to do the car seats and so they actually don 't even have a way to move the camera so you can see the kid that 's on the rebound it turns out that those two that actually the three year old did slightly worse so he gets about a five hundred out of you know i would like you to approve it for selling then they would say this is a fantastic new car only got a five hundred it could have gotten as high up as a one thousand and this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors into being approved as a car seat so in some sense what this is suggesting is that it 's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong which is putting children at risk it 's just that fundamentally the car seats aren 't doing much so these are timed at the same time so you can see that it takes much longer with the car seat at rebound it takes a lot longer but there 's just a lot less movement for in a car seat and it turns out that that looks terrible but that 's great that 's like a four hundred ok so that kid would do fine in the crash nothing about that would have been problematic to the child at all and then here 's the the six year old in the seatbelt and in fact they get exactly within you know within one or two the car seat did absolutely nothing so in some sense i was criticized by and i just think that it 's interesting that that the idea of using real world crashes which is very much something that economists think would be the right thing to do something that scientists don 't actually usually think they would rather use a laboratory a very imperfect science of looking at the dummies than actually thirty years of data of what we 've seen with children and with car seats and so i think the answer to this puzzle is that there 's a much better solution out there that 's gotten nobody excited because everyone is so if you think from a design perspective about going back to square one and say i just want to protect kids in the back seat i and then let 's make this really big contraption that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain i mean why not start who 's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids but essentially do something like this which i don 't know exactly how much it would cost to do but there 's no reason i could see why this should be much more expensive than a regular car seat it 's just actually you see this is folding up and then you fold it down and the kid sits on top and it 's integrated it seems to me that this can 't be so the question is is there any hope for lies in a story the answer both to why has a car seat been so successful and why this may someday be adopted or not lies in a story that my dad told me relating to when he was a doctor in the u s air force in england and this is a long time ago you were allowed to do things then you can 't do today would have patients come in who he thought and he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them and he 'd say come back in a week if you still feel lousy ok and most of them would not come back but some of them would come back and when they came back he still convinced they were not sick had another jar of pills in this jar were huge horse pills they were almost impossible to swallow and these to me are the analogy for the people would look at these and say man this thing is so big and so hard to swallow if this doesn 't make me feel better you know what possibly could and it turned out that most people wouldn 't come back because it worked but every once in a while there was still a patient convinced that he was sick but now i 've got one that 's so potent that is really tiny and small and almost almost like this thing here which you can 't even see and it turned out that never in all the times my dad gave out this pill so my dad always took that as evidence that and in some sense if that 's the right story i think integrated car seats you will see very quickly becoming something that everyone has the other possible conclusion is well maybe after coming to my father three times getting sent home with placebos he still felt sick he went and found another doctor and that 's completely possible and if that 's the case then i think we 're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come thank you very much audience i just wanted to ask you when we wear seatbelts we don 't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life it 's also to prevent lots of serious injury your data looks at fatalities it doesn 't look at serious injury is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury because that would prove your case steven levitt i find very small differences so in this data it 's statistically insignificant differences in injury between car seats and lap and shoulder belts in the new jersey data which is different because it 's not just fatal crashes but all crashes in new jersey that are reported it turns out that there is a ten percent difference in injuries but this as a disclaimer there is medical literature which suggests that car seats are dramatically"
