  "transcript": "anyone heard of it power shifted from the few to the many from oval offices to central squares from carefully guarded airwaves but before was a global symbol of liberation there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways i study muslim societies around the world at gallup educated and illiterate my talk today draws on this research to reveal why arabs rose up and what they want now but those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today i 'm going to focus a lot of my talk on egypt it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there of course but it 's the largest arab country and it 's also one with a but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics so after analyzing mounds of data what we discovered was this unemployment and poverty alone it was the difference between what arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel to tell you what i mean consider this trend in egypt on paper the country was doing great but under the surface was a very different reality even though gdp per capita had been growing at five percent for several years egyptians had never felt worse about their lives now this is very unusual because globally we find that not surprisingly people feel better as their country gets richer and but it was exactly the opposite in egypt as the country contrary to the clash of civilizations theory arabs didn 't despise they desired it among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice in their own words to their political system is transparent and it 's following democracy in its true sense open minded with each other majorities as high as ninety percent and greater in egypt indonesia and iran told us in two thousand and five that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country especially in egypt but pressed up against these democratic aspirations especially in egypt while aspiring to democracy the most they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month at only four percent it left many more worse off as people felt less and less free they also felt less and less provided for so rather than viewing their former regimes as so now that egyptians have ended mubarak 's they potentially could be an example for the region it could be a model the core issues that propelled the revolution aren 't addressed the consequences could be catastrophic but for the entire region region the signs don 't look good some have said won the majority in parliament the military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country 's economy continues ignores the real revolution far less divided on lines than we would think ' priorities for but most of all for the first time in decades they expect to be active participants not spectators in the affairs of their country i was meeting with a group of newly elected parliamentarians from egypt and tunisia a couple of weeks ago and what really struck me about them was that they weren 't but they kind of struck me as nervous for lack of a better word one said to me our people used to gather in cafes to watch football or soccer as we say in america and now they gather to watch parliament really watching us and we can 't help but worry that we 're not going to live up to their expectations and what really struck me is that less than twenty four months ago it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government and the reason that they 're expecting a lot is because for the future so right before the revolution we said that egyptians had never felt worse about their lives but not only that they thought their future would be no better it actually got harder but people 's expectations for their future went up significantly and this hope this optimism endured a year of turbulent transition so while egyptians were known for their turnout in elections before the revolution the last election had around seventy percent voter where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in two thousand and ten i 'm surprised it was a quarter ninety percent thought that this last election was honest now why this matters is because we discovered a link between people 's faith in their democratic process and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone now i know what some of you are thinking the egyptian people and many other arabs who 've revolted and are in they 're just expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems but this conclusion and that egyptians ' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves in the country once known for its passive resignation where as bad as things got only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official today ninety percent tell us that if there 's a but the power and this empowerment they were doctors and artists and organizers a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in egypt were women now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of islamist parties means women what we 've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there 's no female consensus now what this suggests is that how women view religion 's role in society is shaped more by their own country 's culture and context and that it must be central and now how men feel about women 's rights because we discovered a link between men 's support for women 's employment and how many women are actually employed in professional fields what about men 's views of religion and law [ does ] a man 's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women 's rights the answer is no we found absolutely no correlation no impact whatsoever between these two variables what drives men 's support for women 's employment is men 's employment their level of education as well as a high score on their country 's u n human development index what this means is that human development not secularization is what 's key to women 's empowerment in the transforming middle east and the transformation continues it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people thank you"
