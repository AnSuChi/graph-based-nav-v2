  "transcript": "the most important and prioritized sense that we have we are constantly looking at the world around us and quickly we identify and make sense of what it is that we see here you go go with your gut reaction okay we actually surveyed over one hundred and twenty individuals and the results were mixed people did not agree on what emotion they saw on his face and if you asked somebody on your right they might have said something entirely different like hope or empathy so we are all looking at the very same we might see something entirely different because perception is subjective what we think we see is actually filtered through our own mind 's eye there are many other examples of how we see the world through own mind 's eye i 'm going to give you just a few softball players compared to people who had a hot night at the plate so my research team and i decided to test this question in what we found in this survey was that some people some americans think photographs like these best reflect how obama really looks of these people seventy five percent voted for obama in the actual election other people though thought photographs like these best reflect how obama really looks of these people voted for mccain so people did not realize that what we were changing from one photograph to the next i see something very different than somebody else does so vision scientists know that the amount of information that we can see at any given point in time what we can focus on is actually relatively small what we can see with great sharpness and clarity and accuracy equivalent of the surface area of our thumb on our outstretched arm and it 's our mind that helps us fill in that gap i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye why is it that somebody might literally see the glass as half full and somebody literally sees it as half empty what is it about what one person is thinking and feeling that leads them to see the world in an entirely my research team and i decided to delve deeply into an issue that has received international attention and there is a variety of strategies that we have to help us keep the pounds off we set the best of intentions to exercise after the holidays but that is not enough to bring us back to our ideal weight but one reason i argue is that our mind 's eye might work against us some people may literally see exercise as more difficult and some people might literally see exercise as easier so as a first step to testing these we measured the circumference of their waist compared to the circumference of their hips waist to hip ratio is an indicator of being less physically fit than a lower waist to hip ratio but before they did that we asked them to estimate the distance so what did we find people who were out of shape and unfit actually saw the distance to the finish line as significantly greater than people who were in better shape people 's states of their own body but so too can our mind in fact our bodies and our minds work in tandem to change how we see the world around us that led us to think that maybe people with strong motivations and strong goals to exercise so to test whether motivations we gathered objective measurements based on feedback that we gave them some of our participants told us they 're not motivated to exercise any more they felt like they already met their fitness goals and they weren 't going to do anything else these people were not motivated we had them estimate the distance how far away was the finish line importantly though this only happened for people who were not motivated to exercise on the other hand people who were highly motivated to exercise even the most out of shape individuals saw the but people who had committed to a manageable goal that they could accomplish in the near future and who believed that they were capable of meeting that goal actually saw the exercise as easier that led us to wonder is there a strategy that we could use and teach people that would help so we turned to the vision science literature to figure out what should we do and based on what we read we came up with a strategy that we called keep your eyes on the prize it 's an actual directive for how to look around your environment we told them to focus their attention on the finish line to avoid looking around we thought that this strategy would help make the exercise look easier we compared this group to a baseline group to but you might also notice the garbage can off to the right so what did we find when we had them estimate the distance was this strategy yes but the big could this help make exercise actually better could it improve the quality of exercise as well we added we told them to lift their knees up high and walk to the finish line quickly we designed this exercise in particular to be moderately challenging but not impossible like most exercises so the big question then did keeping your eyes on the prize and narrowly focusing on the finish line change their experience of the exercise it did people who kept their eyes on the prize told us afterward that it required seventeen percent less exertion for them to do this exercise than people who looked around naturally it also changed the objective nature of their exercise people who kept their eyes on the prize actually moved twenty three percent faster than people who looked around naturally to put that in perspective a twenty three percent increase we were so excited by this because this meant that a strategy that costs nothing that is easy for people to use regardless of whether they 're in shape or struggling to get there had a big effect keeping your eyes on the prize made the exercise look and feel easier even when people were working harder because they were moving faster but keeping your eyes on the prize might be one additional strategy that you can use to help promote a healthy lifestyle let me leave you with one final here 's a photograph of a beautiful street in stockholm but that 's not how we see it and sometimes that might not but it doesn 't mean that one of us is right and one of us is wrong but we can teach ourselves to see it differently and and on days like these it looks like everyone around me is down in the dumps too my colleague at work looks annoyed when i ask for an extension on a deadline and on days like perhaps my colleague was confused perhaps my friend was concerned and on some days it might look like the world is a dangerous and challenging and insurmountable place it might actually become so thank you"
