  "transcript": "for several years now we 've been engaged in a national debate about sexual assault on campus but that 's where the conversation about sex is ending and in that vacuum of information the media and the internet that new digital street corner are educating our kids for us enjoyably it 's time to have open honest discussion and that includes breaking the biggest taboo of all and talking to young people about women 's capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure yeah come on ladies i spent three years talking to girls ages fifteen to twenty about their attitudes and experience of sex take this sophomore at the ivy league college who told me i come from a long line of smart strong women my grandmother was a firecracker my mom is a professional my sister and i are loud and that 's our form of feminine power starting when she was thirteen that were not especially responsible not especially reciprocal and not especially enjoyable she shrugged i guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures who don 't express our wants or needs wait a minute i replied didn 't you just tell me what a smart strong woman you are she hemmed and hawed hawed i guess she finally said no one told me that that smart strong image applies to sex teenagers are not engaging in intercourse more often or at a younger age than they were twenty five years ago they are however engaging in other behavior and when we ignore that when we label that as sex that opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect that 's particularly true of oral sex which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse girls would tell me it 's no big deal like they 'd all read the same instruction manual at least if boys were on the receiving end young women have lots of reasons for participating it was a way to boost social status sometimes it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation as a freshman at a west coast college said to me a girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night because she doesn 't want to have sex with him and he expects to be satisfied so if i want him to leave and i don 't want anything to happen heard so many stories of girls performing one sided oral sex that i started asking and he never got you a glass of water or if he did it was like ' totally begrudging you wouldn 't stand for it but it wasn 't always that boys didn 't want to it was that girls didn 't want them to girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals a sense that they were simultaneously icky and sacred women 's feelings about their genitals have been directly linked to their enjoyment of sex yet believes that girls is under siege with more pressure than ever to see them as unacceptable three quarters of college women remove their pubic hair all of it at least on occasion and more than half do so regularly girls would tell me that hair removal made them feel cleaner that it was a personal choice though i kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island if this was how they would choose to spend their time avoiding humiliation guys act like they would be disgusted young woman told me no one wants to be talked about like that the rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s when women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs there 's a way that i think that this too is a sign that a girl most intimate part open to critique to becoming more about how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her the shaving trend has sparked another rise in which is the trimming of the inner and outer labia cosmetic surgery among teenage girls it rose eighty percent between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and fifteen and whereas girls under eighteen comprise two percent of all cosmetic surgeries they are five percent of labiaplasty wait for it i trust i don 't have to tell you that barbie is a made of plastic and b has no genitalia which is rarely medically indicated has not been proven safe and whose side effects include numbness pain and diminished sexual sensation sara mcclelland a psychologist at the university of michigan coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this intimate justice and it raises similar issues about physical and mental health intimate justice asks us to consider and how does each partner define good enough honestly i think those questions are tricky and sometimes traumatic for adult women to confront but when we 're talking about girls i just kept coming back to the idea that their early sexual experience shouldn 't have to be something that they get over in her work mcclelland found that young women were more likely than young men to use their partner 's pleasure as a measure of their satisfaction so they 'd say things like if he 's then i 'm sexually satisfied young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own orgasm young women also defined bad sex differently in the largest ever survey ever conducted on american sexual behavior they the young men never used that language so when young women report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to or greater than young men 's and they do in research that can be deceptive if a girl goes into an encounter encounter hoping that it won 't hurt wanting to feel close to her partner and expecting him to have an orgasm she but absence of pain that 's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment listening to all of this and thinking about it i began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological starting in infancy parents of baby boys are more likely to name all their body parts at least they 'll say here 's your pee pee parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees and they leave this whole situation in here unnamed there 's no better way to make something unspeakable then kids go into their puberty education classes and they learn that boys have erections and ejaculations and girls have periods and they see that internal diagram of a woman 's reproductive system you know the one that looks kind of like a steer head so we never say vulva and then they go into their partnered experience and we expect that somehow they 'll think sex here 's something though girls ' investment in their partner 's pleasure remains regardless of the gender of the partner so in same sex encounters and young women climax at the same rate as men lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me that they felt liberated to get off the script free to create an encounter that worked for them but it 's worth questioning why we consider this one act which most girls with discomfort or pain to be the line in the sand of sexual adulthood coercion betrayal assault whether it 's encouraging mutuality and caring whether it 's giving them more control over and joy in their experience and what it means about gay teens who can have multiple sex partners without heterosexual intercourse so i asked a gay girl that i met how 'd you know you weren 't a virgin anymore she said she had to google it and google wasn 't sure she finally decided that she wasn 't a virgin anymore after she 'd had her first orgasm with a partner and i thought whoa what if just for a second we imagined that was the definition and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal this helps us reconceptualize it as a pool of experiences and it 's worth asking young people who 's really the more sexually experienced person the one who makes out with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual tension and communication or the one who gets wasted at a party and hooks up with a random in order to dump their virginity before they get to college the only way that shift in thinking can happen though is if we talk to young people more about sex if we normalize integrating them into everyday life talking about those intimate acts in a different way the way we mostly have changed in the way that we talk about women in the public realm consider a survey of three hundred randomly chosen girls from a dutch and an american the dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls regret enjoying themselves what was their secret teachers and parents talked to them candidly from an early age about sex pleasure and the importance of mutual trust what 's more while american parents weren 't necessarily less comfortable talking about sex we tend to frame those conversations entirely in terms i have to tell you as a parent myself that hit me hard because i know had i not delved into that research i would have talked to my own child about about disease protection about consent because i 'm a modern parent and i would have thought job well done now i know i want them to see sexuality as a source of creativity and communication if they are i want them to have recourse from their schools their employers the courts but it 's not too much as parents teachers advocates and activists we have raised a generation of girls to have a voice to expect egalitarian treatment now it 's time thank you"
