  "transcript": "comparable in its own very and it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with i refer to organized crime now it has experienced an unprecedented expansion now accounting for roughly fifteen percent of the world 's gdp i like to call it the global shadow economy or mcmafia for short so what triggered this communications all that stuff which we 'll talk about a little bit later now i like solidarity in poland when i was in my teens i then started and eventually i became the bbc 's chief correspondent and so when four hundred and million people finally won the right to choose their own governments i but i was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall it wasn 't long for example before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in yugoslavia amidst the euphoria it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine continued to do so after the revolutions there obviously there were characters like this they used to win the gold medals in and they were the great celebrities of communism with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it they used to get great apartments and they could travel to the west very freely which was a great or as i like to call them they are the midwives of capitalism here are some of those same weightlifters after their one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine makeover now in bulgaria this photograph was taken in bulgaria when communism collapsed all over eastern europe it wasn 't just communism it was the state that collapsed as well that means your police force wasn 't working the court system wasn 't functioning properly so what was a business man in the brave new world of east european capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored well privatized law enforcement agencies and in bulgaria the mafia was soon joined with fourteen thousand people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine and one thousand nine hundred and ninety one when your state is collapsing your economy is heading south at a rate of knots the last people you want coming on to the labor market are fourteen thousand men and women whose chief building underground networks when i was working in the 1990s i spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in yugoslavia and i couldn 't help notice that and so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal but above all else by talking to but also as they say in the retail trade it 's location and what i noticed at the beginning of my research that the balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world the european union which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history eventually comprising some five hundred million people and a significant minority of those five hundred million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes sticking fifty euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers it has zones of production like afghanistan and it has zones of the united states the zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed take mexico for example six thousand people killed there in the last eighteen months as a direct consequence five million people have died there it 's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers but it 's the biggest conflict on this planet since the second world war and why is it because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region in the year two thousand coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone in almost every laptop and games console the and it is this western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime let me show you some of my friends in action caught conveniently on film by out the factory gate are very cheap the european union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world so if you can smuggle them into the e u there are very handsome and i want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups twenty of these boats made the trip across the adriatic from montenegro to italy and instead that money went to underwrite the wars in yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals now italian police when this trade started had just two boats which could go at the same speed and this is very important because the only way you can catch these guys is if they sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution and if the police intervened they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning rather than chasing so what were these guys doing with all the money they were making well it was the liberalization of international financial markets and did that make it easy the last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre in the and a lot of licit banks were also happy but at the heart of this is the offshore banking network and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime money laundering you have to get rid of them on a positive note we at last have someone in the white house who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities and if anyone is concerned about what i believe is the necessity for let 's take a look at bernie madoff who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail bernie madoff stole billion dollars that puts him up there on the olympus of gangsters with the colombian cartels and the major but he did this for decades in the very heart of wall street and no regulator picked up on it so how many other madoffs are there on wall street or in the city of london fleecing ordinary folk and let me go on to the one organized crime now and that is narcotics our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning this one however is in central british columbia where i photographed it it 's one of the tens of thousands of now i was taken by inspector brian cantera of the royal canadian mounted police to a cavernous warehouse east of vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the rcmp from the smugglers who are sending it of course down south to the united states as it 's called in part because it 's marketed as organic which of course goes down very well in california even by the police 's admission the global narcotics market no concomitant increase in the resources available to may all be it was last month actually that canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs interestingly the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing reproducing their highs now that is a game changer because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the western world that happens it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west the drugs policy which we 've had in place for forty years is long overdue for a very well organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession not surprising the most opportunistic industry in the whole world and it has no rules to its regulatory system and competition from other groups i e a bullet in the back of the head what they 've done is they 've shifted their operations people don 't smoke as much dope or visit prostitutes quite so frequently and so instead they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way but above all more together hooked it up to my laptop and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major the technology the key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering or to use the technical term for it there 's one born every minute and it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this of course the quickest way to a person 's wallet is through the promise of sex and love i expect some of you remember the iloveyou virus one of the very great worldwide viruses that came i was very fortunate when the iloveyou virus came out because she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time but love was not amongst them and so as soon as i saw this drop into my inbox i dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty so cybercrime do watch out for it we do know that the internet is doing is the internet is assisting these guys these are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the artesunate is a very effective drug at and they fear that the reason why it 's developing a resistance is because cambodians can 't afford the drugs on the commercial market and so they buy it from the internet and these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient which is why parasite is beginning to develop a resistance the reason i say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives you don 't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime they affect our bank accounts they affect our communications our pension funds they even the food that we eat and our governments"
