  "transcript": "about the two biggest social trends in the coming century and perhaps in the next ten thousand years but i want to start with my work on romantic love because that 's my most recent work what i and my colleagues did was and then go on into where i think love is going ancestors i started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last forty five years of research and as it turns out there 's a very specific the first thing that happens is a person begins to take on what i call special meaning as a truck driver once said to me the world had a new center and that center was mary anne george bernard shaw said it differently love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another and then you just focus on this person you can list what you don 't like about them but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do as chaucer said love is blind in trying to understand romantic love i decided i would read poetry from all over the world and i just want to give you one very because it 's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman it 's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot their car is different from every other car in the parking lot their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass and it goes like this it 's by a guy called yuan zhen the night i brought you home i watched you roll it out probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain just like with you and me but anyway not only does this person take on special meaning but you have intense energy as one polynesian said i felt like jumping in the sky you 're up all night you 're walking till dawn mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly i liked simple romantic love is very simple you become extremely sexually possessive i think but the main characteristics of romantic love are craving an intense craving to be with a particular person not just sexually but emotionally it but you want them to call you on the telephone to invite you out etc to tell you that that they love you the other main characteristic is and last but not least it is an obsession before i put these people in the mri machine i would ask them all kinds of questions but my most important question was always the same it was what percentage of the day and night do you think about this person and indeed they would say all day all night i can never stop thinking about him or her and then the very last question i would always have to work myself up to this question because i 'm not a psychologist i don 't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation my final question was always the same i would say would you die for him or her and indeed these people would say yes as if i had asked them to pass the salt i was just staggered by it so looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph with a distraction task in between so we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state in fact one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active and indeed that 's exactly what happens i began to realize that romantic in fact i had always thought it was a series of emotions from very high to very low but actually it 's a drive it comes from the motor of the mind the wanting part of the mind the craving part of the mind the kind of part of the mind when you when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate when you want to win you know if you ask somebody to go to bed with you and they say no thank you you certainly don 't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression people who are rejected in love will kill for it people live for in over one hundred and seventy five societies people have left their evidence of of this powerful brain system i have come to think it 's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow and i 've also come to think that it 's one of three basically different brain systems that the craving for sexual gratification w h auden called it an intolerable neural itch and indeed that 's what it is it keeps bothering you a little bit like being hungry the second of these three brain systems is romantic love that elation obsession of early love and the third brain system is attachment that sense of calm and security and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there looking for a whole range i think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time thereby conserving mating time and and i think that attachment the third brain system evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being at least long enough i want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends one of the last ten thousand years and the other certainly of the last the first is everywhere in the world but they are moving into the job market and they are very slowly closing that gap but nevertheless that caravan is moving on women are moving back into the job market and i say back into the job market because this is not new for millions of years on the grasslands of africa women commuted to work the double income family was the standard and women were regarded as just we 're really moving forward to the past women 's worst invention was the plow with the beginning of plow agriculture men 's roles became extremely powerful women lost their ancient in short they are acquiring the status that they had a million we are seeing now one of one of the most remarkable traditions on the business community i 'll say just a couple of things and then go on to sex and love there 's a lot of gender differences anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child we are in the words of ted i 'll only just use women can talk women can talk and indeed they 're becoming a very powerful force even in places like india and japan where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market they 're moving into journalism think that the television is like the global campfire we sit around it and it shapes our minds almost always when i 'm on tv solzhenitsyn once said to have a great writer is of people who are writers in america are women it they 're highly imaginative we now know the brain circuitry of imagination because female parts of the brain are better connected they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think put them into more complex patterns see more options holistic men tend to and these are averages tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous focus on what they do and move in a more there 's many more male geniuses in the world and there 's also many more male idiots in the world and what i really think that we 're doing is we 're moving towards a collaborative society a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life foremost women are starting to express their sexuality i 'm always astonished when people come to me and say why is it that men are so adulterous express less remorse for the partners that they do marry later have fewer children leave bad marriages once again we 're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression is going to be the century of what they call the symmetrical marriage or the pure marriage or the companionate marriage this is a marriage between equals moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit we 're also seeing a rise of romantic love ninety one percent of american women and eighty six percent of american men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner if they were not in love with that person people around the world in a study of thirty seven societies want to be in love with the person that they marry i even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great the second one being the aging world population they 're now saying that in america that middle age should be regarded as up to age so we 're seeing there 's a real extension of middle age for one of my books i looked at divorce data in fifty eight societies and as it turns out the older you get the less likely you are to divorce so the divorce rate right now is stable in america and it 's actually beginning to decline it may decline some more i would even say that hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women as interesting as they are now not at any time on this planet have women been so educated so interesting so capable and so i honestly think that if there however there 's always kinds of complications in this these three brain systems lust romantic love and attachment don 't always go together they can go together by the way that 's why casual sex isn 't so casual with orgasm you get a spike of dopamine dopamine 's associated with romantic love and you can just fall in love with somebody who you 're just having casual sex with with orgasm then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin those are associated with attachment this is why you can feel such a sense of of cosmic union with somebody romantic love connected to each other we 're capable of loving more than one person at a time in fact you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love love for somebody else it 's as if there 's a committee meeting going on in your head we are an animal that was built to reproduce i think the and however we can make good relationships with each other so i want to conclude with two things the worry is about antidepressants over one hundred million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the united states and these drugs been on them ever since she was thirteen i 've got nothing against people who take them short term when they 're going through something horrible they want to commit suicide or kill somebody else i would recommend it but more and more people in the united states are taking them what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin everybody knows that and when you and when you kill orgasm you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment the things are connected in the brain and when you tamper with one brain system you 're going to tamper with another i 'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly i 've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for thirty years why you and i are alike why the iraqis and the japanese and the australian aborigines and the people an internet dating service match com came to me and asked me you know i don 't know do you think you 've got the right person they said yes it got me thinking about why it that 's my current project it will be my next book mystery is important you fall in love with somebody who 's somewhat mysterious in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love you fall in love with somebody who fits within what i call your love map an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up but i want to tell you a story i wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it too the magic of it 's a story that was told to me by and this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student and she was not in love with him and he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody you can drive up the dopamine in the brain and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love so he decided he 'd invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him and sure enough i 've never been in one but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it 's crazy and it 's noisy and it 's exciting he figured that this would drive up the dopamine and she 'd fall in love with him so off they go and she 's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time an hour later they get down off of the rickshaw and she throws her hands up and she says we evolved three basic drives the sex drive romantic love and attachment to a long term partner they 're going to survive as long as our species survives on what shakespeare called this mortal coil"
