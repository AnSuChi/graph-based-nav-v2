  "transcript": "but that wasn like every other human being i avoided trouble in my childhood they taught me silence don 't argue do as you 're told turn the other cheek this was reinforced by the political climate kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich kenya 's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals this was reinforced by the political climate of the day we had a president moi who was a that meant that people were taught to be smart cowards stay we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother what that meant that if you stayed out of trouble you 're going to stay alive i used to question this advice and eight years ago we had an election in kenya results were violently disputed what followed that and the killing of over one thousand people my work was to document the violence as a photographer i took thousands of images signed a peace and the country moved on i was a very disturbed man because i saw the violence firsthand and it disturbed me we decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about my job i said i could not stand it anymore after quitting my job i decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country to speak about the state of the nation and june one two thousand and nine was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president 's attention it 's a national holiday it 's broadcast across the country and i showed up at the stadium my friends did not show i found myself on my feet shouting and suddenly out of nowhere the police pounced on me like hungry lions they held my mouth i spent that night in a cold and that got me and the images that i took were disturbing my life the images that i took were just a number to many kenyans most kenyans did not see the violence it was a story to them and so i decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about we traveled the country and showed the images and this was a journey that has started me to the activist path where i decided to become and our general site from our street exhibit became we have even done we have delivered live pigs to kenya 's parliament as a symbol of our politicians ' greed it across the continent where i used to stand up alone seven years ago now i belong to a community of many people who stand up with me i belong to a group of young people who are so that was my story i said goodbye to the twenty four years living as a coward and the day you discover why that day standing up in that stadium i discovered why i was truly born that i would no longer be silent in the face of injustice do you know why you were you 've created a studio a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action so because we live in a very busy world where people are spite of being arrested beaten up because i discovered who i really am as in that 's what i want to do and there 's such beauty knowing that i 'm meant to do this because you don 't get scared you just continue living your life"
