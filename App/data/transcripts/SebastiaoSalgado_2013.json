  "transcript": "i 'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures i want to start to show just a few pictures to you and after in brazil in the times that brazil was not yet a market economy i was born on a farm a farm that was more than fifty percent rainforest i swam in our small rivers with our caimans it we consumed very few things went to the market once bringing thousands of head of cattle when i was fifteen years old it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger much bigger where i did the second part of secondary school and and i became an activist i [ went to ] university to become an economist i [ did ] a master 's degree in economics my associate in everything that i have done till now my wife llia wanick salgado brazil radicalized very strongly we fought very hard against the dictatorship in a moment it was necessary to and our organization thought it was better for us and we went to france where i did a phd in economics lila became an architect economic projects in africa with the and i started to do the photography that was important for me many people tell me that you are a photojournalist that you are an anthropologist photographer that you are but i lived totally inside photography doing you 'll see inside the social projects that i went to i published many books on i photographed a story mostly in rwanda i saw in rwanda i saw deaths by thousands per day i lost my faith and i started to be attacked he made a long examination you are not sick your prostate is perfect what happened is you saw so many deaths you must stop you must stop because on the contrary you will be dead and i made the i was really upset with photography with everything in the world and i made the decision to go back to where i was born it was a big coincidence it was the moment that my parents when we received this land this land was as dead as i was when i was a kid it was more than fifty percent rainforest when we received the land it was less than half a percent to build our development we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds and we didn 't know how to deal with these and lila came up with an incredible idea and and we started we started to plant and the life started to come back in an incredible way it was necessary we created an institution called instituto terra and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere here in los angeles in the bay area in san francisco it became tax deductible money in spain in italy a lot in brazil we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project the government and this time my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that i had photographed all my life i wished and and i finished at the end of two thousand and eleven we created an incredible amount of pictures and the result llia did the design of all my books the design of all my shows i wanted to see us when i was last week at the brazilian national indian foundation and only in the amazon we have about one hundred and ten groups of indians that are not contacted yet we must protect the forest in this sense and with these pictures i hope that we can create we tried to do a new presentation of the planet and i want to show you now just a few pictures of this project but we create an incredible contradiction to build all this we destroy a lot our forest coming the other day from atlanta here two days ago i was flying over deserts that we made we provoked with our own hands india has no more trees spain has no more the only factory capable to transform co2 into oxygen are the forests the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing i put the question we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in norway ours included that would be very complicated for us for the water system the trees you happy people that have a lot of hair on your head if you take a shower it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don 't use a dryer machine me one minute it 's dry the trees are the hair of our planet when you have rain the root system holds the water all the branches of the trees the leaves that come down and maintain our source maintain our rivers this is the we were starting to construct an educational center that became but you see a lot of small spots in this picture in each point of those spots there are thousands of trees now i 'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago i told you in the beginning us to plant about two point five million trees of about two hundred different species in order my friends it 's very easy we here inside the room and thank you very much"
