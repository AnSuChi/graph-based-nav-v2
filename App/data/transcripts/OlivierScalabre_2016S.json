matters a lot if we look at the history of growth times of big growth have always been fueled by big manufacturing revolutions the steam engine 19th century the mass production model in the beginning of and the first automation wave in the this means either more labor or more capital or more productivity i 'm here today to tell you that we are on the verge of another huge change it will get us out of our growth will change radically the way globalization has been shaped i 'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution it 's not as if we 've done nothing with manufacturing since the last revolution actually we 've made some pretty lame attempts to try to revitalize it but none of them have been the big overhaul we 've tried to relocate our factories offshore in order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor but it only saved money for a short period of time because cheap labor didn 't stay cheap for long we 've tried to make our factories larger and we the idea was that we can make a lot of one product and stockpile it to be sold with demand traditional clothing companies have built offshore global rigid supply chains competitors like zara none of them have been able to keep up with the pace most of them yet with all of their shortcomings those are the factories we know today when you open the doors they look the same as they did we 've just changed the location the size the way they operate we 've made all the tweaks to the model that we could and now we hit after all of our attempts we turned to the tech sector there but it hasn 't done much for productivity what 's surprising is that productivity is on the decline despite all of those innovation efforts watching videos on youtube has made us less productive weird this is why we are not growing what if the existing manufacturing and large technological innovation came together this is the fourth manufacturing revolution and it 's happening right now major technologies are entering the manufacturing space big time and it will let me tell you about some of them have you already met advanced manufacturing robots they are the size of humans they actually collaborate with them and they can be programmed in order to perform complex non repetitive tasks today in our factories only eight percent of the tasks are automated the it means that by advanced robots will complement workers to be together twenty percent more productive to manufacture twenty percent more outputs to achieve twenty percent additional growth this isn 't some fancy futuristic idea these robots are working for us right now it was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history consumers spent three billion dollars on electronics that day that 's real economic growth then there 's additive manufacturing 3d printing 3d printing has already improved plastic manufacturing and it 's now making its way through metal those are not small industries plastic and metals represent twenty five percent of global manufacturing let 's take a real example fuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture for one reason they are made up of twenty different parts that need to be separately produced and then painstakingly assembled which allows them to turn those twenty different parts into just one the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity it 's about producing better smarter products it 's about scale customization imagine a world where you can buy the exact products you want with the functionalities you need with the design you want with the same cost and lead time as a product that 's been mass produced like your car or your clothes or your cell phone the new manufacturing revolution makes it possible advanced robots can be programmed in order to perform any product configuration without any setup time or ramp up 3d printers instantaneously produce any customized design we are now able to produce a batch of one product your product at the same cost and lead time as a batch of many those are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play but actually there are even some bigger implications for all of us when manufacturing will find its way back it will create a huge shift first our factories will be relocated into our home markets consumer proximity is the new norm flexibility does trade flows will be replaced by regional trade flows east for east west for west when you think about that the old model was pretty much insane piling up stocks making products travel the whole world before they reach their end consumers the new model producing just next to the consumer market will be much cleaner but here 's the thing with growth it does not come automatically mature economies will have to seize it we 'll have to massively re train our workforce we need to reverse that and teach manufacturing again at the countries that will boldly transform will be able to seize this growth it 's also a chance for developing economies of course it was not a sustainable model in the long term as those countries are becoming richer last year it was already as expensive to produce in brazil as to produce in france the new manufacturing revolution will accelerate the transition and this is good because this is where growth will be created the next billion consumers in china will inject more growth in our economies than the top five european markets together this fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us this means more wealth distributed to all of us and a better future for our children thank you"
