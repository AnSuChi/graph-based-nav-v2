  "transcript": "it 's my first year but i 'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything i 'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology viruses and so i 'm so excited to discuss this with them and i finally my favorite student she looks me straight in the eye and she says the reading sucked and then she clarified she said you know what i don 't mean that it sucks it means that i didn 't understand a word of it it 's boring um who cares and it sucks and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat but not one of them really understood the main ideas not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool why it 's so important i have no idea what to do next the main characters in the story are bacteria the real bacteria and viruses are so small but what a lot of people don 't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick it starts out once upon a time there 's this happy little bacterium don 't get too maybe he 's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere and then it gets horrible he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides but if you 're a virus and you see this you cross those little legs of yours and you think here 's what had to happen a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it and now that we 've gotten rid of the bacteria dna the virus dna takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses so this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer so replacing the bacteria dna with virus dna turns the bacteria but that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria here this it doesn 't do anything harmful it silently slips into the bacteria 's own dna and it just stays there so now we have a whole extended bacteria family they 're just happily living together until a signal happens and bam all of the dna pops out turns them into virus making factories and they all burst a huge extended bacteria family on the [ right ] is the lysogenic way so this stuff is not that hard right there were a couple of reasons first of all i can guarantee you that their textbooks didn 't have secret agent viruses and they didn 't have horror stories you know in the communication of science there is this obsession and as a writer i was always told never to use stories or fun engaging language because then my work might not be viewed as and check this out but if a textbook seems too much fun it 's somehow unscientific now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier we could start by saying something like these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium it looked like this bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic but here 's the thing there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students because it contains some language that isn 't completely accurate they have something called professional science writer would circle that and say that has to go we have to change it to something much more technical and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation and they 'd have to change everything that wasn 't one hundred percent perfect but it would be completely impossible and it 's like science communication has taken on this idea of what i call the tyranny of precision it 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know who gives us all the details nobody cares about where you 're like i met my friend for lunch the other day and she was wearing these ugly jeans i mean they weren 't really jeans they were more kind of like leggings but like i guess they 're actually kind of more like jeggings like but science education is becoming like that guy who always says actually right you want to be like oh dude we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness and that guy 's like because good storytelling is all about emotional connection we have to convince our audience but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out and i paraphrase i think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education i am often so disappointed when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science that 's not true at all i 'm currently a ph d student at mit and i absolutely but not when we 're trying to teach if a young learner thinks that all viruses have dna that 's not going to ruin their chances but if a young learner can 't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this that will ruin their chances of success and i wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems and i beg them i beseech so we are so lucky that we have resources like the internet where we can circumvent these institutions there 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of and i talk about fuel cells but nonetheless so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science there 's still so and if you 're involved with science in any way i urge you to join me leave out the jargon make me laugh make me let me tell you a story"
