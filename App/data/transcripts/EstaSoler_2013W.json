  "transcript": "i want you to imagine what a breakthrough this was for women who were victims of violence in the 1980s they would come into the emergency room with i would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist and she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court i 've been doing this for thirty years i 've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children i 've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief belief that this violence is not inevitable and if it 's learned it can be un learned and it can be prevented applause why do i believe this and two thousand and ten domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by were beaten they were stalked they were raped and no one talked about it and as an activist and so step one on this journey is we organized and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters and if they didn open a shelter they opened their home so that women and children could be safe you know it 's time that we went to the federal government and asked them to pay for these extraordinary services that are saving people 's lives and so step number two we knew we needed to change the laws and so we went to washington and we lobbied for the first and i remember walking through the halls of the u s capitol and but i heard about a congressman who had a very very different point of view do you know what he called this important piece of legislation he called it the take the fun out of and i wish i had twitter which is a act that has saved so many lives thank you i was proud to be part of that work and it changed the i 'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here i am a data nerd and the reason for that is i want to make sure that if we spend a dollar that the program we should change the plan we are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters and it is about prevention with a capital p and so step number three on this journey and we 're going to have to engage the public and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called there 's no excuse for domestic violence take a look at one of our spots as we were in the process of releasing this campaign o j simpson was arrested for the murder of his we learned that he had a long history of domestic violence the media became fixated and we seized this moment and let me just put this in context before one thousand nine hundred and eighty do you have any idea how many articles were in the new york times on domestic violence i 'll tell you one hundred and and in the over seven thousand we were obviously making a but we were still missing a critical element so step four we needed to engage men and i already told you i 'm a data nerd national polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation how can we include how can we get men to talk about violence against women and girls and a male friend of mine pulled me aside and he said you want men to talk about violence against women and girls men don 't talk but he said do you know what they do do they do talk to their kids they talk to their kids as parents as coaches and that 's what we did we met men where they were at and we built a program and then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships and all of a sudden he looked at the back of the room and he said sit down next to me she sat right down next to him he i do this work because i 'm her dad i get it knowing that there are so many sexual assaults on college campuses that are so widespread and so we 've got to do a better job for our kids have to we 've come a long way since the days of the polaroid technology has been our friend the mobile phone is a global game changer for the empowerment of women and facebook and twitter and google and youtube and all the social media helps us organize and tell our i clap for you i 'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life the optimist club can 't make that one up and i am convinced now more than ever in the capacity of human beings to change i believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality and i ask you stand with us as we create futures without violence for women and girls and men and thank you very much"
