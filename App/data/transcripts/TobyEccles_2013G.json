  "transcript": "not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that but a new business model for social change a new way of tackling the problem in britain percent of all men who come out of short sentences now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit and how many previous times do you think they 've been in prison and we said to the ministry of justice what 's it worth to you there 's what 's it worth now of but and if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we 've been successful at reducing that re offending then we can do something social impact bond is simply saying if we can get the government to agree that we can create a contract where they only pay which for still quite a lot of bits of government so we use the contract to raise money from socially motivated investors there 's a lot of people who if they 're given the chance would love to invest in something that does social good and here 's the opportunity do you want to also help government find whether there 's a better economic model but actually working with them to move to a different path to end up with fewer crimes and they pay for a set of services so in march two thousand and ten we signed the first social impact bond with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison was to work with three thousand offenders and then they would be compared to a group taken from the police national computer as similar as possible and we would get paid providing we achieved a hurdle rate of now if we achieved that 10 percent reduction across all three cohorts then the investors get a seven and a half percent and if we do better than that they can get up to thirteen percent annualized return on their investment so everyone wins here right the ministry of justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works investors get two opportunities for the first time they can invest in social change also they make a reasonable return and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things they 're going to have to believers they 're going to have to care in the then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product the service providers well for the first time they 've got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they 're doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they 're doing over five or six years not just one or two as often happens at now the offenders they also benefit instead of just coming out of the prison with forty six pounds in their pocket half of them not knowing where they 're spending their first night out of jail connects them to benefits connects them to employment drug so let 's think of another example working with children in care social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people so children in the state care tend to do very badly seventy percent of prostitutes have spent some time in care the state is not a great there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care and thirty percent of kids going into care are adolescents so we set up a program with essex county council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those essex only pays in the event that it 's saving others around homelessness in london around and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world so david cameron 's put twenty million pounds obama has suggested three hundred million dollars in the u s budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest so what 's caused this excitement why is this so different for people well the first piece which we 've talked about is innovation it enables testing of new ideas in a way that 's less difficult by working to outcomes people really have to test and bring data we add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different because and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it so when you 're trying to do something like this you need the flexibility to adapt the program we started off with a program but we also greater engagement public sector 's better private sector 's better and this creates a structure through which they can combine so where does this leave us this leaves us with a way possibly millions of people who want the we 've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences thank you"
