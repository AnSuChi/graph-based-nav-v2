  "transcript": "i decided to create an art piece in manshiyat naser i never thought this project would be the most amazing human experience that i would ever live this humanist intention of beautifying a poor and neglected neighborhood by bringing art to it the first time i heard about this christian coptic community was in two thousand and nine when the egyptian authorities under the regime of hosni mubarak decided to slaughter three hundred thousand pigs using the pretext of the first time but to reach there you must dodge add to it but everything is perfectly organized they have developed one of the most efficient and highly profitable systems on a global so my initial idea was to create an a piece that you can only see from one vantage point i wanted to challenge myself artistically by painting over several buildings and having it only fully visible from one point on the muqattam mountain the muqattam mountain is the pride of the community this is where they built the st simon monastery a cave church that they carved into the mountain itself so the first time i stood on top of the mountain and i looked at the neighborhood i asked myself on earth will i convince all those owners to let me paint on their buildings and then magd came magd is a but to convince father samaan i needed to convince mario who is a polish artist who moved to cairo twenty years ago and who created all the artwork of the cave church and he was mainly concerned by what i was going to write in every work that i create i write messages with my style of arabic i make sure those messages are relevant to the place where i am painting but have this universal dimension so anybody around the world can relate to it st athanasius of alexandria a coptic bishop from the third century who said and his approval brought all the residents on board hundreds of liters of paint middle east and the us and after a year of planning and there we are my team and some members from the local community creating a piece that will spread over fifty buildings some here some blue there some yellow there some orange some others carrying some sand bags and putting them on the top of the buildings to hold those manual assembling and disassembling those same lifts and moving them around the different buildings at the beginning of the project and there was no real interaction with the community people didnt get the point of all this the first building was the house of uncle ibrahim and his daughters and sons saved me from his bull who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor actually the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony yeah i remember him saying that he didnt go to the mountain for ten years but surprisingly and he said that this project was a project of peace and his perception towards the project changed perception towards the community changed also and towards what they do so i started doubting myself and wondering what was the real purpose of this whole project was not about beautifying a place by bringing art to it it was about switching perception and standing exactly at this point every day made my realize the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece if you want to see the real image of somebody maybe you should change your angle the strength of the smell and also the stress of not finishing on time the building number three was the house of uncle and all the i was impressed and amazed by the kids of manshiyat naser actually the zaraeeb community was the ideal context to raise the topic of perception we need to question our level of misconception and judgment we can have as a society i remember how we got delayed on uncle ibrahim 's house when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop were eating the sand bags that hold the lifts bakheet and aunty fareeda was this kind of meeting point everybody used to gather there i think this is what uncle ibrahim meant when he said that was a project of peace and unity everyone was greeting us with a smile offering us a drink or inviting us into their own house for lunch and then the same thing happens on the second floor and you keep going all the way to i think i never drink as much tea as i did in egypt and to be honest with you we could have finished earlier but i think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks they have another expression which is i used a white glow in the dark paint for the calligraphy so at the end of the project we rented some black light projectors surprising everybody around we wanted to tell them that they are the ones who brought light to us the people of manshiyat naser call the people of cairo the zabaleen they say they are the ones who produce the garbage the art piece at some point will disappear and actually there is somebody who is building a second floor in front of uncle ibrahim 's house so it 's covering part of the of the painting so i might need to go back and paint over it it was about the experience about the story about the moment thank you"
