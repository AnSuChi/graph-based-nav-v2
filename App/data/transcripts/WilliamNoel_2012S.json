  "transcript": "the ancient world they survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them and so it is and they 're called a b and c and a was lost by an italian humanist in and b was last heard of in the pope 's library about a hundred miles north of rome in viterbo in now codex c is actually buried it was finished by a guy called johannes myrones on the but he didn 't use use new parchment he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts and there were seven of them and archimedes codex c was just one of those seven he erased all of their and he wrote prayers on top of these books and essentially these seven manuscripts he transcribed as much of the text and the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript that were unique texts they weren 't in a and b at all they were completely new texts by archimedes and they were called the method and the stomachion and it became a world famous manuscript now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition it got in worse condition in the 20th century after heiberg saw it forgeries were painted and it suffered very badly from mold this book is the definition of a write off it was bought by a private owner in because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe he wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous he wanted to make that which was expensive because not many people are really going to read archimedes in ancient greek but they should have the chance to do it but actually it wouldn 't be as much as you think because these people they didn 't come from money first problem was a conservation problem and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with the top half is elmer 's wood glue it and it 's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on and so before we could and this is a rare action shot ladies and gentlemen another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax because this was used in the liturgical services of the greek orthodox church and they 'd used candle wax and the candle wax was dirty and we couldn 't image through the it 's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is but it came out in little bits very often and normally in a book you wouldn 't worry about the little bits but these little bits might contain unique archimedes text so tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place so and we put two images into one blank screen here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript and the image on the left is the normal red image and the image on the right is an ultraviolet image and in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the archimedes writing if you merge them together into one digital canvas the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright the prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark the archimedes text is and that 's what it looks like now that 's a before and after image but you don 't read the image on the screen like that you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you can just if you process the same two images in a different way you can actually get rid of the prayer book text and this is terribly important because the diagrams in the in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth i can give them to you with this kind of imaging this kind of infrared ultraviolet invisible light imaging we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries how were we going to do that well we took the manuscript and we decided to image it in x ray fluorescence imaging and as it disappears and when it takes its place it sheds electromagnetic radiation it sheds an x ray and this x ray is specific in its wavelength to the atom that it hits because the ink was written in and if we can map where this x ray that comes out where it comes from we can map all the iron on the page then theoretically we can read the image the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this so we took it to the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton but as the electrons go round at the speed of light they shed x rays and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system this is called synchrotron radiation and it 's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing but we wanted it to look at atoms so that we could read the page from before and after and lo and behold we found that we could do it well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called the stomachion he was trying to work anyone want to guess the answer and the important point about this is that it 's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics and combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made the scribe had made now hyperides and in three hundred and he and demosthenes and this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial and it 's a great speech best of all the one battle that the spartans fought that everybody remembers is the the battle of thermopylae where they were butchered to a man but fought for the it was such a great speech that the and no one so this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity speaking to us not from the grave because his grave doesn 't exist but from the now i should say at this point that normally when you 're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off you don 't find unique texts and to find two in one manuscript is really something to find three and we found a third century a d commentary on it possibly by galen and probably by porphyry now all this data that we collected all the images all the raw images all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a creative commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose why did the owner of the manuscript do do this he did this because he understands data as if you want to ensure their long term utility is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them the thing to do with data if you want it to survive is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible and that 's what he did from this because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing and if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the web at the moment you have to go to the national library of y 's site or the university library of x 's site which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data what you want to do is to aggregate it all together because the web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn 't going to be built by institutions it 's going to be built users by people who get this data together by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things and that is the future of the web and it 's an attractive and and we have put up all our manuscripts on the web for people to enjoy all the raw data all the descriptions twenty four of the twenty eight images you 'll find come from my institution now because what 's really and they know what she looks like because they 've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere for these restrictions at all and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses and it would be a great benefit to everybody why don 't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty"
