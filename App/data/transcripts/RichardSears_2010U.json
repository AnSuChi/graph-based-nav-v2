  "transcript": "for the next few minutes we 're going to talk about energy and it 's going to be a bit of a varied talk i 'll try to spin a story about energy and oil 's a convenient starting place the talk will be broadly about energy but oil 's a good place to start and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff you take about eight eight or so carbon atoms about twenty hydrogen atoms you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid very as far as it goes here 's my little pocket map of where it 's all located a bigger one for you to look at but this is it this is the and we could end it there and say well oil 's going to last forever because well there 's just a lot of it but there 's actually more to come talk to me about it i 'll fill in some of the details if you want there 's just a lot of it and it 's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those one hundred and fifty years little secret i 'm going to tell you about for the last twenty five years oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems there was one kind of peak oil in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five when oil represented fifty percent of global energy supply now it 's about thirty five percent it 's been declining and i believe it will continue to probably peaked in two thousand and seven and is declining so oil is playing a less significant role there was a peak oil just like in the 1920s there was a peak coal this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems and what 's been taking up the slack in the last few decades well a lot of natural gas i think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas and beyond that peak renewables now i 'll tell you another little very important story about this picture now i 'm not pretending that energy use in total isn 't increasing it is that 's another part of the story come talk to me about it we 'll fill in some of the details but there 's a very important message here this is two hundred years of history and for two hundred years we 've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system reaching maybe thirty percent of primary energy by mid century now that might be the end of the story okay we just replace it all with conventional renewables but i think actually there 's more to the story than that and to tell the next part of the story and this is looking out say two thousand one hundred well we have to take a little excursion and we here 's a piece of limestone i picked it up outside of marble falls texas now here 's a piece of chalk i and you wouldn 't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this yeah it 's very different no it 's not different it 's not different off the coast of california oh by the way just in case you weren 't already guessing it 's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this it 's thousands of times maybe three thousand times tougher than this and why because the lowly abalone making this beautiful iridescent mother of pearl very specialized material that the abalone how the molecules are put together whether we 're talking about fuels or energy carriers or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells nature hasn 't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature didn 't need to until maybe now imagine what would it be like like if instead of this we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently and so that is my story thousands of years ago people invented ideas they had ideas innovations technology and the stone age ended not because we ran out of stones thank you very much"
