  "transcript": "is it that french people do better than all the others wine but let me suggest a fourth one mathematics did you know that paris has more mathematicians than any other city in the world and more streets with mathematicians ' names too and if you look at the statistics of the fields medal often called the nobel prize for mathematics and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of forty you will find that france has more fields medalists what is it that we find so sexy in math just numbers and computations and rules to apply but it 's not dull and it 's not about is about reasoning it is about finding the truth there 's nothing like the feeling which invades you when after months of hard thinking you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world close your eyes for moment and think of what is occurring right now around you invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you by the billions and billions at each second and open your eyes now to the statistics of the the law of errors of deviations with respect to the mean behavior it 's one of the most important curves keeps on occurring again and again from many theories and many experiments as a great example of the universality which is so dear to us mathematicians the famous scientist francis galton said it would have been deified by the greeks if they had known it it is the supreme law of unreason better way to materialize that supreme goddess than galton 's board inside this board are narrow tunnels through which tiny balls will fall down randomly going etc all in complete randomness and chaos let 's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together trapped here inside this transparent box as dream in the sandman comics for you and this is touching the mystery of that goddess replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation all of science is like this and beautiful mathematical explanations they also they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories and the gauss curve it was not the first time that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world more than two thousand years ago at the time of the ancient greeks it already occurred using mathematics was able to measure the earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent a pendulum swings slightly slower in cayenne than in paris newton rightly deduced that the earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles like zero point three percent so tiny that you wouldn 't even notice it on the real view of the earth these stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition measure the earth which seems infinite see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape and it is this mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition here 's a modern example you will all relate to searching the internet the world wide web more than one billion web pages do you want to go through them all but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling to find the information hidden in the data and there are many people who have their version of the facts who do you want to interview first answer prime witnesses you see suppose that there is person number seven and maybe person number three in turn points at person number one as the primary source now number one is a prime witness so i definitely want to interview but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify and this graph i may think of it as but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other referring to each other for contents enter pagerank one of the early cornerstones of google this algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to determine automatically the most relevant web pages in the same way as we used randomness in the galton board experiment so let 's send into this graph a bunch of tiny digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph and again again and again and with small growing piles we 'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited by these digital marbles here we go randomness randomness and look at this from the chaos will emerge the solution the the solution emerges from the randomness google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms just one problem in a million making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one to the extent that a it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs in a study about the best and worst jobs published by the wall street journal in two thousand and nine mathematician best job in the world and why not stochastic processes linear programming or fluid simulation and through them there is big money in mathematics and let me concede that when it comes to making money from the americans are by a long shot the world champions ultimately on good algorithm it is filled with perplexity frustration a desperate fight for understanding let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician 's life or should i say one of the most striking nights at that time i was staying at the institute for advanced studies in princeton for many years the home of albert einstein and the most holy place for mathematical research in the world it was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas which are a crowd of electrons in the perfect world of plasma there are no collisions or damps out as if called the landau damping is one of the most important in physics and it was discovered through mathematical ideas and together with my former student and main collaborator in paris at the time we had been working for months and months on such a but the truth is the proof was just not working in spite of more than one hundred pages of complicated mathematical arguments and a bunch discoveries and huge calculation it was not working i was putting in there all my energy and still nothing was working one my head i swear take the second term to the other side fourier transform and invert in l2 damn it that was the start of the solution but really my brain had continued to work on it in those moments you don 't think of your career or your colleagues complete battle between the problem and you it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work and after we completed our huge analysis of the landau damping i was lucky enough to get the most coveted fields medal from the hands of the president of india in hyderabad on nineteen august two thousand and ten and because it was a collective adventure you need to share it not just with your collaborators collaborators i believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it and i 've been working with my staff at institut together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide so that we can found our own very special museum of mathematics there so in a few years please come and visit us at institut henri poincar and share the mathematical dream with us thank you"
