  "transcript": "i believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we 've left more than one billion of our members in the fight against extreme and why they make poverty a winnable fight in our lifetimes i stayed overnight with a farm family they were wonderful people they invited me into their home we sang songs together and ate a simple dinner they gave me a blanket to sleep on the floor and then at lunchtime i watched with an increasingly sick feeling and i knew i had to accept their hospitality children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally every day they fail to eat they lose a little bit of their future amongst the extreme poor one in three children are permanently stunted from a lifetime of not eating enough and only one quarter of children complete high school because they lack but until we solve these problems for all of our members we fail that standard these children matter but remember our friend archimedes global poverty has powerful levers it 's a problem like any other let 's engage our collective passion for problem solving and figure out what those levers are this gets me really excited all of these people one and it gets better they earn more food they reduce environmental pressure or we can clear cut forest and savannah to make more farmland which would be environmentally disastrous and not a farmer look at the strength and the will radiating from this woman she is physically strong mentally tough and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children if we 're going to put the future of humanity in one person 's hands then i 'm really glad it 's her they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe these are tools and techniques that date to the bronze age and it 's why many farmers are still very poor let me walk you through the three most basic factors in farming first hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together if you naturally pollinate a high yielding variety together with a drought resistant variety you get a hybrid that inherits positive traits from both of its parents if used responsibly is environmentally sustainable if you just a pinch of fertilizer to a plant that 's taller than i am you unlock enormous yield gain these are known as farm inputs when you space your seeds and plant with massive amounts of compost farmers multiply their humanity actually solved agricultural poverty a century ago we just haven 't delivered these things to everybody just yet in this century the reason that people remain poor is because maybe they live in they lack access to these things wherever the world 's companies but what about in practice what do these delivery networks look like i want to share the concrete example that i know best my organization one acre fund we only serve the farmer and our job is to provide her with the tools that she needs to succeed we start off by delivering farm inputs but it 's pretty possible let me show you and store it in twenty warehouses like this then during input delivery we rent hundreds of 10 ton trucks and send them out to where farmers are waiting in the field they then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms it 's kind of like amazon for rural farmers realistic delivery also includes finance a way to pay and then we surround all that with training wherever we deliver our services farmers use these tools to climb out of this is a farmer in our program consolata today i 'm proud to say that we 're serving about four hundred thousand farmers like scalable delivery governments and nonprofits that have delivery armies just like this but we analyzed and we found that half of farmers live in just these shaded regions they would only cover the eastern united states if america can deliver pizza to an area of this size governments and non profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers this is possible i 'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming again using a this is what i would call a highly achievable delivery zone we just lack the will if we are willing every one of teachers farmer sales agents for life improving goods these are the delivery people that dedicate their careers to improving the lives of others but this may surprise you but no matter what your technical specialty there is a role for you in this fight we need a lot more resources this is our number one constraint we need a big expansion of venture capital we need more visionary philanthropists and global leaders who will take problems in human development if you 're interested in these ideas check out this humanity has put people on the moon we 've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet but we 've left more than one billion of our until every girl like this one has an opportunity to earn her full human potential we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race we just need to deliver proven goods and services to everybody let 's deploy our thank you"
