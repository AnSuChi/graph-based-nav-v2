  "transcript": "and we live and work in india i 'd like to begin with my very first object which i call the uncle phone and it was inspired by my uncle and as i grew up it became worse and worse and i started to think of it as a form of control but of course i could never say anything because and the situation that irked me and mystified me the most was his use of a landline telephone the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him and so as a response and as a gift to my uncle i made him the uncle phone it 's so long that it requires two people to use it it 's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that 's designed for one person but the problem is that when i left home and went to college i started missing his commands and so i made him a golden typewriter through which he could dispense his commands to nephews and nieces around the world as type his email or command and pull the paper out so my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface and of course the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism the way my uncle likes it the next work is a sound sensitive installation that we affectionately call the pygmies and we wanted to work with a notion of being surrounded by a tribe of very shy sensitive and sweet creatures so how it works is we have these panels which we have on the wall and behind them we have these little creatures which hide so when it 's quiet it 's sort of coming out from behind the panels and they hear like humans do or real creatures do so they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile and they don 't react to background sounds moment that they don 't react to but they react to foreground sounds you 'll hear that in a second so each pygmy has so this is a very early prototype of course it got much better after that and we made them react to people but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us so i 'm just going to show you a very early prototype on the right side you can see my colleague soren who 's actually in the space and on the left side you 'll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible and as people walked into the room they would see themselves in the monitor except with one difference one person was constantly invisible and from the front this object appeared to be very strong and robust and from the side it almost seemed very weak and it would get exhausted and it would collapse every time laughter so this work is a caricature of an upside down man his head is so heavy full of heavy thoughts that it 's sort of fallen into his hat well what he does is he moves around in a very drunken fashion on his head in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement and it 's kind of constrained by that circle because if that circle weren 't there and the floor was very even it would start to wander about in the space and there 's no wires so i 'll just show you an instance so when people enter the room it activates this object and then it gains momentum and it looks like it 's almost about to fall and this is an important moment because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and because if we made it in a way that it would topple over then it would damage itself and if it didn 't fall enough it wouldn 't instill that fatalism or that sense of wanting to go and help because it manages to lift itself up on its own so this is a work that we were very intrigued with working with the aesthetic of fur embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes of fiber optics which twinkle like the night sky and it 's at the scale of the night and the idea was to sort of contrast something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe into the familiar form of a teddy bear which is very comforting and intimate and the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky and it 's called space filler well imagine a small cube that 's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room and as you approached it it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that 's twice its height and [ eight ] times its volume and so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it almost like it were trying to conceal a so we work with a lot of technology but but we use it because we 're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create and once a creature pops into our minds it 's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move thank you"
