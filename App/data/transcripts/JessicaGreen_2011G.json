  "transcript": "where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye microorganisms what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors and they are brought inside by humans and other the fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans and with the human built environment and today architects and biologists are working together we spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments like this building here heating and air conditioning given the amount of time that we spend indoors it 's important to understand how this affects our health at the biology and the built environment center we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air and we looked at three different types of rooms we looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated which are the data points in the blue we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable but they made them operable for our study if you look at the x axis of this graph you 'll see that what we commonly want to do which is keeping the outdoors out we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation so if you look at the green data points which is air that 's outside you 'll see that there 's a large amount of microbial diversity or variety of microbial types but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health if you look at the y axis of this graph you 'll see that in the mechanically ventilated air you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen or germ so to understand why this was the case which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples the data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart and the first things that you can see from this graph is if you look at the blue data points which are the mechanically ventilated what we 've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans and this is because we 're all constantly shedding microbes so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one why does this matter it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the united states and the model that we 're working with in hospitals and also with many many different buildings is to keep the and given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections hospital acquired infections so just as we manage national parks where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others we 're working towards and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside thank you"
