  "transcript": "if we don 't do that we 're going to get they 're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them and a bunch of our activities are in fact in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us or as broadly as we can i 'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone one is what 's on the boston public library carved above their door is free to all it 's kind of an inspiring statement and i 'll go back at the end of this i 'm a librarian and what i 'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it and the idea of using technology is perfect for us i think we have the opportunity to one up the greeks it 's not easy to one up the greeks but with the industriousness of the egyptians they were able to build the library of alexandria the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it on the other hand if you did then great things happened i think we can one up the greeks and achieve something and i 'm going to try to argue only one point today that universal access to all knowledge so if i 'm successful then you 'll actually come away thinking we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published yes there 's issues about how money should be distributed and that 's still being refigured out but i 'd say there 's plenty of money and there 's plenty of demand so we can actually achieve that but i 'm going to go over the technological social and sort of where are we as a whole trying to get and the way i 'm going to try to do this is do it like the website the so if we start with books you know sort of where are we well first you have to as an engineer scope the how big is it if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available well how big a problem is it well we don 't really know but the largest print library in the world is the library of congress it 's twenty six million volumes twenty six million volumes it is by far and away the largest so you know terabytes fits in a computer system that 's about this big on spinning spinning linux drives and it costs about sixty thousand dollars so for the cost of a house or around here a garage you you can put you can have spinning all of the words in the library of congress that 's pretty neat then the question is do you get you know is it worth trying to get there do you actually want it online some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books and that if you happen to have like books in certain ways and you can search them make little tabs and it 's kind of cute still very but i don 't know reading things on a laptop whenever i pull up my laptop it always feels like work but i have to say that there 's that i tend to like and we sort of said well how hard is this and it turns out to not be very hard we actually went off to make a and they actually come out kind of nice looking you can actually get really good looking books there are some other bookmobiles running around this is eric eldred making books at walden pond thoreau 's works this is just before he got kicked out by the parks services for competing with the bookstore there in india they 've got another couple bookmobiles running around and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria the new library of alexandria in egypt it was quite popularly attended and kids starting to make their own books and a happy kid with the first book that he 's ever owned so the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where i can handle sort of sounds a little retro but i think it still has its place and being from the silicon valley sort of utopian and we found in about thirty days we could go and a couple folks from from silicon valley fly them to it works what we found out of this is we didn 't have the right books send things to india and china one is a print on demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine we have one of these things now it 's completely you can press a button and make a book something else i 'm quite excited about beyond these sort of kiosk y things where you can get books on demand is some of these new little screens that are coming out and i don 't mean to to so here 's one of the beta units and you can it actually turns out to be a really we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it and it turns out that two hundred dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good at two hundred dots per inch it 's kind of the equivalent of a three hundred dot print laser printer we 're in good enough shape you actually can go and read scanned books well let 's try out this send books to india thing and there was a project with funded by the national science foundation sent a bunch of scanners and the american libraries were supposed to send books well they didn 't they didn 't want to send their books so we bought one hundred thousand books and sent them to india and then we learned why you don 't want to send books to india if you really care about books butcher them because you could just buy another one that 's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning but the indians have been scanning a lot of their own books about three hundred thousand now doing very did over a million and the egyptians are about thirty thousand ok if we 're going to need to do this and we sort of picked the price point of ten cents a page if it 's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize ocr package it up make it so that you could download print and bind it the whole shebang we would have achieved something so we started out trying to figure out how do we auto page turning things if we can have mars rovers but it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages and the volume isn 't there so anyway so we ended up making our own book scanner museum lighting so even if it 's a black and white book so you basically do a beautiful respectful job this is not a fax this is the idea is to do a beautiful job as you 're going through and actually it turns out to but some people kind of get into the zen of it and especially if it 's kind of interesting books that you care about in languages that you can read so ten cents a page three hundred pages in your average book thirty dollars a book the library of congress if you did the whole darn thing twenty six million books is about seven hundred and fifty million dollars right but a million books i think actually would be a pretty good start and that would cost thirty million dollars that 's not that big a bill and what we 've been able to do is get into libraries we 've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries and libraries are up for having their books scanned the getty here moving their books to the ucla which is where we have one these scanning centers and scanning their out of copyright books which is fabulous so we 're starting to get the institutional responsibility the thing we 're missing is the ten cents if we can get the ten cents all the rest of it flows we 've scanned about two hundred thousand now we 're scanning about fifteen thousand books a month and it 's starting to to gear up another factor of two so all in all so i think of we 're kind of going from the out of copyright library stuff and amazon com is coming from the in print world and i think we 'll meet in the middle some place and have the classic thing that you have which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel and so we 're starting up a program to do but anyway loaning out of print works the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over so all in all it 's possible to do this in large scale we 're also going back over microfilm and getting that online so we can do ten cents a page we 're going fifteen thousand books a month and we 've got about two hundred and fifty thousand books online counting all the other projects that are starting to add books are within our grasp the idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal yes it costs but one time shot and we 've got basically the history of printed and then there 's business model issues about how to try to effectively get it to people but it is within our grasp technologically and law wise at least for the out of print and out of copyright we suggest to be able to get the whole darn thing online well as best we can tell there are about two to three million disks having been published so published materials we 've been able to sort of point at it costs about ten dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online if you 're doing things in volume so we 've found that there are niches in the music world that aren 't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system and we 've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the net in the united states it doesn 't cost you to give something away right if you give something to a charity or to the public you get a pat on the back and a tax donation except on the net where you can lose your guitars or your house this unlimited bandwidth forever for free and we 've been getting a lot of takers one is the rock ' n ' rollers the rock ' n ' rollers had a tradition of sharing as long as nobody made any money you could concert recordings it 's not the commercial recordings but concert started by the grateful dead and we get about two or three bands a day signing up they give permission and we get about forty or fifty concerts a day we have about forty thousand concerts everything the grateful dead ever did up on the net so that people can so audio is possible to put up but the rights issues are really pretty thorny we 've got a lot of collections now a couple hundred thousand items and it 's growing over time moving images it 's just not that many but half of those were indian but anyway it 's doable but we 've only found about a thousand of these things that to be out but we 've found that there 's lots of other types of movies that haven 't really seen the light of day archival films we 've found also a lot of political films a lot of amateur films all sorts of things that are are basically needing a home a permanent home so we 've been starting to make these available and it 's grown to be very popular we 're not quite a youtube we tended towards things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies which has just been great fun television comes quite a bit larger we started recording twenty channels of television twenty four hours a day it 's sort of the biggest tivo box you 've ever seen it 's about a petabyte so far of worldwide television russian chinese japanese iraqi al jazeera bbc cnn abc cbs nbc hours a day we only put one week up which is mostly for cost reasons which is the cnn was saying that palestinians were dancing in the streets were they let 's look at the palestinian television and find out how can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past and television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable except by jon stewart who does a fabulous so fifteen dollars per video hour and also about one hundred dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars per celluloid so we 've got about one hundred thousand pieces up there so books music video software there 's only fifty thousand titles of it mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections but we 've worked through some of those but we we 've still got real problems in washington well we 're best known as the world wide web we 've been archiving the world wide web since one thousand nine we take a snapshot of every website and actually it 's really been pioneered by alexa internet which donates this collection to the internet archive and it 's been growing along if you go and search on something this is the different versions of it that we have this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release and this is what it looked like at stanford so anyway you 've got basically an idea of where things came from mostly people want to see their old stuff out of this if there 's one thing that we want to learn from the library of alexandria version one which is probably best known for burning so we 've started to so this is a picture of the internet archive at the library of alexandria and we now have also another copy building up in amsterdam so flood zone in amsterdam the library of alexandria carved above their door"
