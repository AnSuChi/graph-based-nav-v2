  "transcript": "i 'm a savant or more precisely a autistic savant it 's a rare condition and rarer still when a mastery of language quite often the urge is stronger than they are and they blurt it out if i give you my date of birth can you tell me what day of the week i was born on or they mention cube roots or i hope you 'll forgive me if i don 't perform a kind of one man savant show for you i 'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots a little deeper i want to talk to you briefly about perception when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make anton chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details that other people seem to miss every time i read chekhov i 'm reminded of why i too became i explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding i 'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them the calculation can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall or look at the foreign word and the sounds can you get a sense of the range of meanings and in terms i 'm asking you to do this because i believe our personal perceptions you see are at rather than abstract reasoning guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know i 'm an extreme example of this as juan said it 's the condition that scientists call synesthesia an unusual cross talk between the senses here are the numbers one to twelve as i see them every number with its own shape and character one is a flash of white light six five is yellow i paint as well and here is one of my paintings it 's a multiplication of two prime numbers three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape the answer to the sum what about bigger numbers the mathematical constant it 's an infinite number literally goes on forever in this painting that i made i take the colors and the emotions and the textures and i pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape but it 's not only numbers that i see in colors words too for me have colors and emotions and textures and this is an opening phrase from the novel lolita and nabokov was himself synesthetic and you can see here how my perception of the sound l helps the alliteration another example a little bit more mathematical and i wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from the great gatsby there is a procession of syllables wheat one and it helps the sentence to feel right let 's go back to the questions i posed you a moment ago number and that 's why so that gives us a form that we can picture that we can perceive what about well if one hundred if we think of one hundred as being like a square seventy five would look like this so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind something like this and in the right hand corner you don 't have to calculate anything four sixteen that 's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math i 'm sure it 's sixteen sixteen sixteen the second question i 'm assuming so let me narrow the choices down to two is it a happy word or a sad word what and it actually means sad why do statistically a majority of people say that a word is language evolves in such a way correspond with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience of the listener let 's have a look at the the third question it 's a line from a poem by john keats express fundamental relationships should in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships and poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings in the case of hare it 's an ambiguous sound in english it can also mean the fibers that grow from a head and if we think of that let me put the picture up the fibers represent vulnerability they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion so the hare itself the animal not a cat not a dog a hare why a hare because the overlong the overlarge feet helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means to limp i hope i 've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things shapes and personalities vaster i hope that i 've given you the desire to learn to see thank you"
