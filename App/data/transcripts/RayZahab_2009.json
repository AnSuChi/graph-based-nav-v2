  "transcript": "together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the south pole thirty three days twenty three hours and fifty five minutes to get there we shaved five days off the previous best time and in the process i became the first person in history to make the entire solely on feet without skis if you will dragging a sled as you just saw in that video clip with one hundred and seventy pounds of gear in it everything you need to survive on your antarctic trek it 's going to be forty below every single day you 'll be in a massive headwind and at some point you 're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice these crevasses some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them that could give way at a moment 's notice taking your sled you into the abyss never to be seen again yes it 's uphill the entire way because the south pole is at ten thousand feet and you 're starting at sea level our journey did not in fact begin at hercules inlet where frozen ocean meets the land of antarctica it began a little less than two years ago of buddies of mine and i had finished a and while we were there we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in northern africa we also learned that many of the issues facing the people of northern africa affected young people the most i came home to my wife after one hundred and eleven days of running in the sand and we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to but if i 'm going to continue doing these adventures there has to be a reason for me to do them beyond just getting there around that time i met an extraordinary human being peter thum who inspired me with his actions he 's trying to find and solve water issues the crisis around the world his dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition a run to the south pole where with an interactive website will be able to bring young people students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me as active members depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces crossing miles and miles of sastrugi frozen ice snowdrifts that could be i 'm telling you crossing these things with 170 pound sled that sled may as well have weighed one thousand seven hundred pounds because that 's what it felt like sometimes twenty hours of trekking daily to meet our goal forty below on our sled incidentally students people from around the world would ask us questions young people would ask the most amazing questions one of my favorite it 's forty below where are you going to go and how are you going to do it i 'm we slept in a tent that was very low to the ground because the winds on antarctica were so we were burning about eight thousand five hundred a day so we needed it how many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have virtually none all of our equipment including film equipment was charged by the sun i certainly hope so because at some point or another on this expedition one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle and put it in an infected blister drain it for you because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people they were our teammates they were inspiring us the stories we were hearing got us to the south pole the website worked brilliantly as a two way street of communication pretending they were richard ray and kevin we huddled into that tent forty five below that day i 'll never forget it we looked at each other with these and i remember looking at the guys thinking what do i take from this journey you know seriously i take from this journey"
