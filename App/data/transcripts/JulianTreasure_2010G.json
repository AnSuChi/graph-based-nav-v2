  "transcript": "one translation of which is the world is sound and in a way that 's true because everything is vibrating in fact all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies so you are in fact a chord each of you an individual chord one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony incidentally we see just one octave they work even when you sleep the smallest sound you can perceive moves your eardrum just the loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that ears are made not for hearing but for listening listening is an active skill whereas hearing is passive listening is something that we have to work at it 's a relationship with sound and yet it 's a skill that none of us are taught reductive listening is listening expansive listening on the other hand is listening with not listening for it 's got no destination in mind it 's just enjoying the journey women typically listen if you look at these two eye contact facing each other possibly both talking at the same time the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise surrounding us all the time noise like this according to the european union is reducing the health and the quality of the population of europe two percent of the population of europe that 's sixteen million people are having their sleep devastated by noise like that it 's a really big problem now when you were little if you had noise and you didn 't want to hear it you 'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum these days you can do a similar thing it just looks a bit cooler it the trouble with widespread headphone use is it brings three really big health issues the first really big health issue is a word that murray schafer coined schizophonia it 's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear so we 're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us i think there 's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this listen to this this is an uncompressed piece of music and now the same piece of music with ninety eight percent of the data removed music i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two there is a cost of compression it makes you deafness but really worryingly sixteen percent roughly one in six of american teenagers as a result of headphone abuse one study at an american university found that sixty one percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people if you 're going to use headphones buy the best ones you can afford because and thirdly if you 're in bad sound it 's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it protect your ears in that way let 's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i urge you to seek out wwb birds stochastic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events all seek those sounds out they 're good for you and so it this silence is beautiful the elizabethans described language as decorated silence i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art have a foreground a background all in beautiful it 's fun to get into designing with sound if you can 't do it yourself get a professional to do it for you sound design is the future and i think it 's the way we 're going to change the way the way the world sounds i 'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities eight ways sound can improve health it 's also now being used to treat cancer lithotripsy saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high intensity sound dementia and other conditions generally devotional music good mozart good and four modalities where you need to take some action and get involved first of all listen consciously i hope that that after this talk you 'll be doing that it 's a whole new dimension to your life and it 's wonderful to have that dimension and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice get trained learn to sing learn to play an instrument musicians have bigger brains it 's true and let 's take a stewarding role for the sound around us protect your ears yes absolutely design soundscapes to be beautiful around you at home and at work and let 's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that i played you early on so i 'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound i 'm leaving you with a little more birdsong which is very good for you i wish you sound health"
