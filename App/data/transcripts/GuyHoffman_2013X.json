  "transcript": "my job is to design build and study robots that communicate with people but this story doesn 't start with robotics at all it starts with animation when i first saw pixar 's luxo jr i was amazed by how much emotion they could put into something as trivial as a desk lamp them at the end of this movie you actually feel something for two pieces of furniture and i said i have to learn how to do this so i made a really bad career decision it i left a very cozy tech job in israel at a nice software company and i moved to new to study animation and there i lived in a collapsing apartment building in harlem with roommates i 'm not using this phrase metaphorically the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room whenever they did news stories about building violations in new york they would put the report in front of our building as kind of like a backdrop to show how bad things are and i learned two surprising lessons one of them was that when you want to he actually did the the weasel in ice age and he said as an animator you 're not a director you 're an actor so if you want to find the right motion for a character don 't think about it go use your body to find it stand in front of a mirror act it out in front of a camera whatever you need and then put it back in your character a year later i found myself at mit in the robotic life group it was one of the first groups researching the relationships between humans and robots and i still had this dream to make they were all how should i put it they were all kind of robotic so i went and designed frame by frame to try to make this and here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop and i 'm actually redesigning the robot unbeknownst to itself it 's kind of digging its own grave by helping me and when for example i 'm looking for a battery that i can 't find in a subtle way it 'll show me where the battery is so you i 'm not an actor seem gentle and caring and in the other case seem violent and confrontational and it 's the same structure just the motion is different the psychology the of teamwork and at the same time i found myself in my own kind of teamwork situation with a good friend of mine who 's actually here and in that situation we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us we didn 't have to to divide our tasks we didn 't have to communicate verbally about this it all just happened and humans and robots don 't look at all like this when humans and robots interact it 's much more like a chess game the human does a thing the robot analyzes whatever the human did the robot decides what to do next plans it and does it then the human waits until it 's their turn again so it 's much more like a chess game and that makes sense because chess is great for mathematicians and computer scientists it 's all about information analysis decision making but i wanted to be less of a chess player and more like a i actually participated in a play i hope theres no video of that around still and i got every book i could find about acting including one from the 19th century that i got from the library and i was really amazed because my name was the second name on the list the previous name was in one thousand eight hundred and eighty nine and this book was kind of waiting for one hundred years to be rediscovered for and this book shows actors how to move every muscle in the body to match every kind of emotion that they want to express and method acting said have to plan every muscle in your body instead you have to use your body to find the right movement you have to use your sense memory and this came at the same time as i was reading about this which also talks about the same ideas we use our bodies to think we don 't just think with our brains and use our bodies to move but our bodies feed back into our brain to generate the way that we behave which i never really published called acting lessons for artificial intelligence and i even took another month to do what was then the first theater play with a human and a robot acting together that 's what you saw before with with the actors and i thought how can we make an intelligence model so i worked for quite a long time on these models and i implemented them on a number of robots here you can see a very early example with the robots trying to use this embodied artificial intelligence to try to match my movements as closely let 's look at it you can see when i psych it out and it 's a little bit like what you might see actors do when they try to mirror each other to find the right synchrony between them and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence actually used two kinds of brains for the same robot the robot is the same lamp that you saw and i put two brains in it for one half of the people i put in a brain that 's kind of the traditional calculated robotic brain it waits for its turn it analyzes everything it plans let 's call it the calculated brain the other got more the stage actor it sometimes acts without knowing everything it and i had them do this very tedious task that took almost twenty minutes and they had to work together somehow simulating like a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing what i found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot they thought it was more intelligent more committed a better member of the team contributed to when they talked about it after the task with the adventurous brain they said by the end we were good friends and high fived mentally whereas the people with the calculated brain said it was just like a lazy it only did what it was supposed to do and nothing more which is almost what people expect robots to do so i was surprised that people had higher expectations of robots than what anybody in robotics thought robots should be doing and in a way i thought maybe it 's time just like method acting changed the way people thought about acting in the 19th century from going from the very calculated planned way of behaving to a more intuitive embodied way of behaving maybe it 's time for robots to have the same kind of revolution and i was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians and i thought music that 's the perfect place to look at teamwork coordination timing improvisation and we just got this robot playing marimba and the marimba for everybody like me it was this the human would play the robot analyzed what was played and would improvise their own part so this is what musicians called a call and response interaction and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence maybe i can make the the robots jam together like a like where the robot doesn 't really know what it 's about to play it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play sometimes you don 't know what you 're doing and you still do it so i tried to make a robot where the robot listens to the human musician and then look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with about making notes otherwise nobody would and i thought we already have a robot musician on stage why not make it be a full fledged musician it just expresses what the so i spent i would say on average three to four hours a day there i think and i went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like but especially what a robotic musician would move like to sort of show that it doesn 't like what the other person is playing and maybe show whatever whatever beat it 's feeling at the so we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot which was nice i 'm going to show you now the same kind of performance this time with a socially expressive head and notice one thing how the robot is really showing us the beat it 's picking up from the human while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it 's doing and also how it changes the way moves as soon as it starts its own solo now look at the final chord of the of the piece again and this time the robot communicates with its body when it 's busy doing its own thing and when it 's ready to coordinate the final chord with me and at some point we are in atlanta here you can see the robot basically responding to the beat notice two things one how irresistible it is to join the robot while it 's moving its head you kind of want to move your own head when it does it and second even though the rapper is really focused on his iphone as soon as the robot turns to him he turns back so even though it 's just in the periphery of his vision in the corner of his eye we are wired for that so if you have a problem maybe your partner is looking at their iphone or smartphone too much you might want to have a robot there to get their attention to introduce the last robot that that we 've worked on it came out of something surprising that we found some point people didn 't care about the robot being intelligent able to improvise and listen and do all these embodied intelligence things that i spent years developing they really liked that the robot was enjoying the music and they didn 't say the robot was moving to the music they said enjoying the music and and i designed a new piece of furniture this time it wasn 't a desk lamp it was a speaker dock one of those things you plug your what would happen if your speaker dock didn 't just play the music for you but would actually enjoy it too and so again here are some animation tests from from an early stage and this is what the final product looked like a lot of bobbing heads in the audience so we can still see robots influence people and it 's not just fun and games i think one of the reasons i care so much about robots that use their body to communicate and use their body let you in on a little secret we roboticists are hiding is that every one of you is going to be living with a robot at some point in your life somewhere in your future there will be a robot in your life if not in yours your children 's lives and i want these robots to be to be more fluent more engaging more graceful than currently they seem to be and for that i think maybe robots need to be less like chess players and more like stage actors and more like musicians maybe they should be able to take chances and improvise thank you"
