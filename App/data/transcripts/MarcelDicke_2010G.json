  "transcript": "'m going to show you again something about our diets and i would like to know what the audience is and so who of you ever ate insects that 's quite a lot but still you 're not representing the overall population of the earth laughter but this is quite good why not eat insects well and here you see just a there 's six million species of insects on this planet but if we would count all the and we take an average weight of them it would amount to something like two hundred to two thousand kilograms for each of you and me on earth that means that in terms of biomass insects are more abundant than we are and usually without us was an estimation a conservative estimation a couple of years ago it 's a number very large and so i looked up what the economy it was eighty well we know that that was contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude they pollinate our crops a third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants they and they 're food for animals they 're at the start of food chains and at the end of the food chain we are eating them as well there 's quite a lot of people that are eating insects and here you see me in a small provincial town in china lijiang about two million inhabitants if you go out for dinner bee pupae delicacies you can eat something new everyday there 's more than one thousand species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that that we 're eating like a cow or a pig or a sheep more than one thousand species in this provincial town in china they 're doing that but not us well we 've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally but without any exception noodles because insects are here all around us when they 're out there in nature and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency there 's meat in there anyway in fact all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of so anything is a good protein source already now you may say so we 're eating five hundred grams just by accident we 're even doing this on purpose in a lot of food items that we have i have only two items here on the slide pink cookies or surimi sticks or if you like campari a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a or is being sold as crab meat is white fish that 's being dyed with cochineal cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti it 's being produced in large amounts one hundred and fifty to one hundred and eighty metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru and it 's big business one gram of cochineal costs about thirty euros so it 's now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me for everyone on this earth the human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially where at the moment we have something between six and seven billion people it will grow to about nine billion in two thousand and fifty that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed and this is something that worries more and more people there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this how are we going to feed this world and if you look at the figures up but we need an agricultural production increase of seventy percent and that 's especially because this world population but we 're also getting wealthier and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and meat in fact is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production our diet consists most of us here get it and we eat quite a lot of it in the developed world which goes up to one hundred and twenty in the united states but on average eighty kilograms per person per year but it 's increasing enormously in china in the last twenty years it increased from twenty to fifty so if a third of the world population is going to increase to eighty on average and a third of the world population is living in china and in india we 're having an enormous demand on meat and they have the same share that we have now to start with i should say that we are eating way too much meat we could do with much much less and i know i 've been a vegetarian but then there 's a lot of problems that come with meat production and we 're being faced with that more and more often the first problem that we 're facing is human health pigs are quite like us they 're even models in and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human and because of their kind of reproduction they can combine and produce a new virus this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever so that 's one point for insects and there 's the conversion factor you so if you would be you can get either one or nine we 're not taking the bonus yet we 're not taking so that 's two points for insects if we take ten kilograms of food and it results in one kilogram of beef the other nine kilograms are waste and a lot of that is manure if you produce insects you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce furthermore per kilogram of manure you have much much less ammonia so you have less waste so that 's three points for insects now and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality well there have been all kinds of analyses and in in fact it 's comparable one kilogram of grasshoppers so that 's four points for insects i can go on and i could make many more points for insects i gave you at least four arguments in favor we 'll have to even if you don 't like it you 'll have to get used to this seventy percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock that 's not only the land where the livestock is walking but it 's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported we can increase it a bit at the expense of so we are just a minority in a country like the the usa the netherlands anywhere on the left hand side you see a market in laos where they have abundantly so but because they think it 's a delicacy it 's just very good food shrimps a delicacy or crabs or crayfish and it would make very good into our diet arnold van huis in telling people what insects are what magnificent things they are what magnificent jobs they do in nature and in fact without insects we would not be here in this room we will soon die soon die out as well if we die out the insects will continue very happily so we have to get used to the idea of eating insects and some might think well they 're not yet there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them and one of them is here in the audience marian peeters who 's in the picture i predict that later this year you 'll get them in the supermarkets not visible but as animal protein in the food and they 're being made in the most wonderful ways a dutch chocolate maker a lot of design to it well in the netherlands and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e u over to the hague recently so why not eat because it 's just a normal way of doing so you can try it yourself and i 'm going to and he can have the first bite"
