  "transcript": "grew up interacting with the physical objects around us there are an enormous number of them that we unlike most of our computing devices these objects are much more fun to use when you talk about objects one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing and that is gestures how we manipulate these objects how we use these objects in everyday life we use gestures not only to interact with these objects but we also use them to interact with each other a gesture of namaste maybe to respect someone or maybe in india i don 't need to teach a so i am very interested from the beginning how our knowledge so i started this exploration and it literally started with a mouse on my desk i actually opened it most of you might be aware that in those days the mouse used to come with a ball inside and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving and accordingly where the mouse is moving and i actually wanted more so i borrowed another mouse from a friend never returned to him and i now had four rollers i took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line it had some strings and pulleys and some springs what i got is basically a i thought of sticky notes i thought why can i not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world a message written on a sticky note to my mom or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar a to do list that automatically syncs with you or maybe you can write a query saying what is dr smith 's address and this small system actually prints it out so it actually acts like a paper just made out of paper so i implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions but they can actually draw so that it 's more intuitive to use that way then i thought why not make a google map rather than typing a keyword to find something i put my objects on top of it if i put a boarding pass it will show me where the flight gate is a coffee cup or where you can trash the cup among all these experiments there was one thing in common i was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world but then i realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing we want to know about things we want to know about dynamic things going around so i thought last year in the beginning of the last year i started thinking why can i not take this approach in the reverse way maybe how about i take my digital world and paint why can i not remove this confine i took it very literally and took my bike helmet put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely so now what i can do i can the world around me with this digital information later we moved to a much better but the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go you can start using any surface any wall around you as an interface the camera is actually tracking whatever you 're doing with your hands it 's understanding that gesture tracking one finger here we are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present the camera is actually doing just getting all the images is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms and it takes a photo for you thank and later i can find and start browsing those photos or maybe ok i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend so we are looking for an an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world and of course if you don 't have any surface you can start using your palm for simple operations here i 'm dialing a phone number just using my hand the camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements but interestingly is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand for example in this case the book and checking out which book it is once it has that information it finds out more reviews about that or maybe new york times has a sound overview on that so you can actually famous talk at harvard university this was obama 's visit last week to mit and particularly i want to thank two outstanding on just a newspaper your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated you have to check your computer in order to it will change the way we interact with people also not only the physical and playing a pong game inside the train on on the ground right but many of you argue actually that what about that and many of you are excited about the so rather than waiting for that i actually made my own just using a piece of paper so what i did here is remove the camera all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera i removed the microphone from that and then just pinched that like i just made a clip out of the microphone and clipped that to a piece of paper any paper that you found but the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving you can of course watch movies the camera is actually understanding how you 're holding the paper and playing a car racing game many of you already must have thought ok you can browse yeah of course you can browse to any any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it so more interestingly i 'm interested in how we can take that when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my full size computer we can just play with papers paper world is interesting to play with here i 'm taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from ok this looks nice let me print it out that thing so i now have a print out of that thing so the the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe i think that integrating information to everyday objects will not but will also help us in some way to stay human to be more connected to our physical world and it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines or is this research forever or what pranav mistry so there are lots of companies sponsor companies of media lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the ngos in india thinking why can we only have ' sixth sense ' we should have a ' fifth sense ' for missing sense people who cannot speak this technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system plans are you staying at mit or are you going to do something with this pm i 'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own sixthsense device because the hardware is actually not we will provide all the open source software for them maybe starting next month you going to split your your time going forward pm there is a lot of energy here lots of learning all of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in india and now if you see it 's more about the cost effectiveness this system costs you $ three hundred compared to the $ twenty thousand or maybe even the $ two mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ five thousand to president abdul kalam at that time and then he said ok we should use this in bhabha atomic research centre for some use of that so i 'm excited about how i can bring the technology to the masses rather based on the people we 've seen at ted i would say you 're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now it 's an honor to have you at"
