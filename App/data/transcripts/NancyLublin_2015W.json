  "transcript": "a girl i 've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people i 'm the ceo of it 's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people in fact it 's bigger than the boy scouts in the united states we 're not homophobic and it 's true the way we communicate with young people is by text because that 's how young people communicate so we 'll run over two hundred campaigns this year things like collecting peanut butter for food pantries or making valentine 's day cards for senior citizens who are homebound and we 'll text them and we 'll have a ninety seven percent open rate it 'll over index hispanic and urban we collected two hundred thousand jars of peanut butter and over three hundred and sixty five thousand valentine 's day cards this is big scale ok but there 's one weird side every time we send out a text message we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens but text messages about being bullied text messages about being addicted to pot and the worst message we ever got he told me not to tell anyone are you there we couldn 't believe this was happening we couldn 't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being and that she would share it with us and we realized we had to stop triaging this and we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain so we launched crisis text line very quietly in chicago and el paso just a few thousand people in each market we were in all two hundred and ninety five area codes in america just to put that into perspective that 's zero marketing and faster growth than when facebook first launched text is unbelievably private no one hears you talking we get things like i want to die i have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me and so the crisis counselor says how about you put those pills in the drawer while we text and they go back and forth for a while and the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address because if you 're texting a text line you want help so she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they 're texting back and forth with no response from this girl and the next message that comes in says it 's the mom i had no idea and i was in the house we 're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital as a mom that one just the next message comes a month later i just got out of the hospital i was diagnosed as and i think i 'm going to be ok i would love to tell you that that 's an unusual exchange but we 're doing on average two point four one active rescues a day thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression huge the beautiful thing about crisis text line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate and getting them from hot moments to cold moments it 's exciting and i will tell you that we have done a total of more than six point five million text messages in less than two years but the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this the thing that really gets me psyched is the data velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus we can do things like predictive work we can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set chances are someone here someone watching this has seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life you do not have to raise your hand oh they have a degree from harvard on the wall are you sure he didn 't graduate in the bottom ten percent when my husband and i saw a marriage counselor i thought she was a genius when she said i 'll see you guys in two weeks but i need to see you next week sir we have the data to know what makes a great counselor we know that if you text the words numbs and sleeve there 's a ninety nine percent match for cutting we know that if you text in the words mg and rubber band there 's a ninety nine percent match for substance abuse pop up says ninety nine percent match for cutting try asking one of these questions to prompt the counselor or ninety nine percent match for substance abuse here are three drug clinics near the texter us more accurate on the day that robin williams committed suicide people flooded hotlines all over this country it was sad to see an icon a funnyman commit suicide we had a spike in volume also so we can handle severity not chronological this data is also making the world better because i 'm sitting on the world 's first map of real time crises think monday the worst time of day for substance abuse 5am because it is the number one state for suicidal and it 's in a place called and i want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at take care of those native american reservations in montana evidence policing school boards everything better i don 't think of myself as a mental health activist i think of myself as a yeah that sounded too girly i 'm nerdy and the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat funded companies is that i 'm not inspired by helping you find chinese food at 2am in dallas or helping you touch your wrist and or swipe right and get laid i 'm inspired i want to use tech and data and i hope that she is somewhere safe and i hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of crisis text line and inspires me every freaking day"
