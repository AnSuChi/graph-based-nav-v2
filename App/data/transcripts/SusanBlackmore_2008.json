memetics memetics is founded on the principle of universal darwinism darwin had this amazing idea indeed some people say it 's the best idea anybody ever had isn 't that a wonderful thought that there could be such a thing as a best idea anybody ever had but let me just paraphrase the origin of species one thousand eight hundred and fifty nine in a few sentences what darwin said was something like this if you have creatures that vary and that can 't be doubted i 've been to the galapagos and i 've measured the size of the beaks and the size of the turtle shells and so on and so on and one hundred pages later and if there is a struggle for life such that nearly all of these creatures die and this can 't be and if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were you see the idea if if if then he had no the principle is without the aid of mind there 's one word i love on that slide what do you think my favorite word is anything else if there 's something that is copied with variation and it 's selected then you must get design appearing out of nowhere the principle here we 're so used to thinking in but the principle of universal darwinism is that any information that is varied and selected will produce design and this is what richard dawkins the information that is copied he called the replicator it selfishly copies not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going i want to get copied and he wanted to get away from everybody thinking all the time about genes and so he said is there another replicator out there on the planet ah yes there is look around you here will do in this room by language by talking by telling stories by wearing clothes by doing things this is information copied with variation and selection this is is design process going on he wanted a name for the new replicator and abbreviated it to meme just because it sounds good and made a good meme an effective spreading meme so that 's how the idea came about it 's important to stick with that definition the whole science of memetics is is much maligned much misunderstood much feared but a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition a meme is not equivalent to an idea it 's not it 's that which is imitated and what about oh i can 't see any interesting memes here oh well your earrings i don 't suppose you invented the idea of earrings you probably went out and bought them there are plenty more in the shops that 's something that 's passed on from person to person ted is the way to think about memes though is to think why do they spread they 're selfish will get copied if they can some of them will be copied even though they 're not some it 's quite hard to tell why international hotel somewhere all memes but they 're sort of useful ones and then there 's this one what is this one doing this has spread all over the world it 's not surprising that you all found it when you arrived but i took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent in the eco camp in the jungle in assam and why laughter some people get carried away other people are just lazy and make mistakes some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes with a little sticker what is this all about actually all it tells you is that another person has potentially spread spread germs from place to place imagine a world full of brains and far more memes than can possibly find homes the memes are all trying to get copied trying in inverted commas that 's the shorthand for if they can get copied they will they and we are the meme machines now why is this important why is this useful what does it tell us it gives us a completely new view of human origins and what it means to be human all other theories explaining the big brain and language and tool use and all these things that make us unique tool use must have enhanced our survival mating and so on it the point of memetics is to say oh no it doesn 't there are two replicators now on this planet began imitating there was a new copying and it could never be right from the start it could never be that human beings who let loose this while their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy lighting fires keeping fires going techniques of hunting these kinds of things inevitably they were also copying or wearing strange clothes or painting their faces or whatever so you get an arms race between the genes which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains and not waste their time copying all this stuff and the memes themselves like the sounds that people made and copied in other words what turned out to be language competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger so the big brain on this theory is driven by the memes this is why in the meme machine i called it memetic drive they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes that that are doing the driving this is why we 've ended up with such peculiar that we like religion and music and art language is a parasite that we 've adapted to not something that was there originally for for our genes on this view and we end up with a symbiotic relationship with this new parasite and so from our perspective we don 't realize that that 's how it began is a view of what humans are hardly at all the memes took i 've been wondering for a long time since i 've been thinking about memes a lot is there a difference between the memes that we copy the words we speak to each other the gestures we copy the human things and all these technological things around us i have always until now but i i do honestly think now we need a new word for technological memes let 's call them techno memes or temes because the processes are getting different we began perhaps five thousand years ago with writing we put the and we 're getting there we 're at this extraordinary that there are machines like that and indeed in the short time i 've already been at ted i see we 're even closer than i thought we were before are are forcing our brains to become more like teme machines our children are growing up we 're going to have all kinds of implants drugs that force us to stay awake all the time we 'll think we 're choosing these things but the temes are making us do it so we 're at this cusp now of having a third replicator on our planet now what about what else is going on out there in the universe but i think he concentrated on the wrong things it 's been very productive that equation he wanted to estimate and he included in there the rate of star formation the rate of planets but crucially intelligence i think that 's the wrong way to think about it but what 's really important is the replicators you have and the levels i would suggest that we don 't think intelligence we think replicators the same thing the number of communicative civilizations out there [ that ] we might expect in our galaxy just start with the the number of planets there are in our galaxy because it 's only the third replicator that 's going to reach out sending information sending probes getting out there and communicating with anywhere else because every step is dangerous but it 's dangerous take the first step we may take the gaian view i loved peter ward 's talk yesterday it 's not gaian all the time actually life forms produce things that kill themselves but then a long time later billions of years later we got the second replicator the memes that was dangerous all right think of the big brain how many mothers do we have here you know all about big brains they are dangerous to give birth to are agonizing my cat gave birth to four kittens purring all the time ah mm slightly different it kills lots of babies it kills lots of mothers and it 's very expensive to produce the genes are forced into producing all this myelin all the fat to myelinate the brain do you know sitting here your brain is using about twenty percent of your body louise leakey talked yesterday what happened to the others but now we 're hitting as i 've just described we 're hitting the third replicator point because the temes are selfish replicators and they don 't care about just information why would they they are using us to suck up the planet 's resources to produce more computers and more of all these amazing things we 're hearing about here at ted we created the internet for our own benefit that 's how it seems to us think temes spreading because they must we are the old machines one that is obviously happening all around us now is that the temes turn us into teme machines with these implants with the drugs with us merging with the technology and why would they do that because we are we have babies we make new ones and so it 's convenient to piggyback on us because we 're not yet at the stage on this planet where the other option is viable although it 's closer i heard this morning it 's closer than i thought it was it wouldn 't matter and it was no longer possible for humans to live here because those teme machines they wouldn 't need they 're not squishy wet we got the second"
