  "transcript": "unstable male that i completely lost my heart to he hunted flies that didn 't exist he suffered from hallucinations he was diagnosed with a canine but like with humans sometimes it 's six months in before you realize that the person that you love has some issues and most of us do not take the person we 're dating back to the bar where we met them back to the friend that introduced us or sign them back up on match com and that is what i did and i was a i 'd studied and had you asked me ten years ago if a dog i loved or just dogs generally had emotions i would have said yes but i 'm not sure that i would have told you that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder a prozac prescription and a therapist and what i discovered is that i i do believe they can suffer from mental illness and actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them often helps us be better friends to them and also can help many of us think that we can 't know what another animal is thinking but any of you in relationships at least this is my case just because you ask someone that you 're with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn 't mean that they can tell you they may not have words to explain and they may not know it 's actually a pretty recent phenomenon that we feel that we have to talk to someone to understand their emotional distress it also turns out that thinking about mental illness in other animals isn 't actually that much of a stretch most mental disorders in the united states are and when you think about it fear and anxiety are actually really extremely helpful animal emotions usually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous and once we feel them we then are motivated to move away from whatever is dangerous the problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don 't call for it and obsessive compulsive disorders also are often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing which is keeping yourself clean and groomed or you develop a ritual that 's so extreme that you can 't sit down to a bowl of food unless you engage in that ritual so we have the diagnostic and statistical manual which is basically an atlas of the currently agreed upon mental disorders we have youtube laughter this is just one search i did for ocd dog but i encourage all of you to i 'm going to show you just a couple examples this is an example of i know and it 's funny and in some ways it 's cute so they won 't go for a walk they won 't hang out with their friends they 'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively he looks like he 's on a stakeout but he does this for many many many hours a day he just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw at the screen this is another example of what 's considered a stereotypic behavior and if you pay close attention and if i showed you guys the full half hour of this clip you 'd see that he does the exact same thing in the exact same order and he spins the stick in the exact same way every time move from side to side many of us do this and sometimes but it 's not just stereotypic behaviors that other animals engage in this is gigi she 's a gorilla that lives at the franklin park zoo in boston she actually has a harvard psychiatrist and she 's been treated for a mood disorder among other things many animals develop mood disorders lots of creatures this horse is just one example develop 'll gnaw on things or do other things that may also soothe them even if they 're self destructive which could be considered similar to the ways that some humans cut themselves plucking turns out if you have fur or feathers or skin you can pluck yourself compulsively lab rats pluck themselves too in them it 's called barbering canine veterans of conflicts of iraq and afghanistan are coming back with what 's considered canine ptsd and they 're having a hard time reentering civilian life when they come back from deployments they can be too scared to approach men with we are all different raised in the same household exposed to the very same things one may develop say so and it turns out we 're actually so so one great thing that has happened to me is recently i published a book on this and every day now that i open my email or when i go to a reading or even when i go to a cocktail party people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met and recently i did a reading in california and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said dr braitman i think my cat has she was a rescue and she used to live with an elderly man and one day the man was vacuuming and he suffered a heart attack and he died ping was discovered in the apartment and the vacuum had been running the entire time for many months up to i think two years after that incident but with the loving support of her family a lot of a time and their confident cat i met a monkey named boonlua dragged himself to a monastery where the monks took him in they called in a veterinarian and the keepers really decided to take him under their wing and they figured out what he liked which it turned out was mint mentos and but they worried because he was social that he was lonely and they didn 't want to put him in with another monkey and so they gave him a rabbit and it had in a way given him a reason to wake up in the morning and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up that he decided not to sleep in fact he was so protective and so affectionate with these babies that the sanctuary eventually had to take them so after they were taken away the sanctuary staff worried that he would fall into a depression and so to avoid my official opinion is that he does not look depressed so one thing that i would really like people to feel is that you really should feel empowered if you think that they are traumatized or depressed you 're probably right i don 't think though that that 's a problem i don 't think that we can not anthropomorphize it 's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head and put it in a jar and then use it to think about another animal or do you anthropomorphize poorly and anthropomorphizing poorly is all too common laughter it may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding or getting too close to exotic wildlife because you believe that you had a spiritual connection there 's all manner of i believe is based on accepting our animal similarities with other species and using them to make assumptions that are informed about other animals and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry one in five americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug from the antidepressants and antianxiety medications to the antipsychotics it turns out that we owe this entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal to other animals these drugs were tested in non human animals first and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects the very popular antipsychotic thorazine first relaxed rats before it relaxed 1950s today however we are not just giving these drugs to other animals as test subjects but they 're giving them these drugs as patients both in ethical and much less seaworld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications when their calves are taken away many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics and antianxiety medications but dogs like my own oliver are given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications to keep them from jumping out of buildings or jumping into traffic just recently actually a study came out in it made them braver less skittish and more likely to explore their environment it 's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs but i can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry is immense and growing from seven billion dollars in two thousand and eleven to a projected nine point two five billion by the and fifteen others like one bonobo who lives in milwaukee at the zoo there was on them until he started to save his paxil prescription and then distribute it among are many many many other therapeutic interventions that help other creatures and here is a place where i think actually that veterinary medicine can teach something to human medicine which is if you take your dog who is say compulsively chasing his tail they want to know how often your dog gets largely behavior therapies you 've tried with that animal those are the things that often tend to help the most especially when combined with i believe that helps the most particularly with social animals is time with other social animals and i have seen parrots do it for people and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants know about you i get a lot of internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships i also think it 's a and had you asked me eight nine years ago about these i would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way and maybe even staged and what i can tell you now is that there is actually something to this this is legit in fact some interesting studies have pointed to oxytocin levels which are a kind of bonding hormone that we release when we 're having sex or nursing or around someone that we care for extremely and beyond that other studies show that i have a friend who really showed me that mental health is in fact a two way street his name is lonnie hodge and he 's a veteran of vietnam when he returned he started working with survivors of genocide and a lot of and he was givena service dog named gander a labradoodle to help him with ptsd and his fear of heights this is them actually on the first day that they met which is amazing probably because he was watching lonnie so closely what 's pretty great about this though is that he 's still a fantastic service dog because now when they 're both at a great height lonnie is so concerned with gander 's forgets to be scared of the heights himself since i 've spent so much time and it 's changed me i look at them as individuals and i think about them as creatures with their own individual weather systems and i really believe that this has made me a more curious and a more empathetic person both to the animals that but also to the people that i know and i really do believe that even though you can 't know exactly what 's going on in the mind of a pig or your pug or your partner that that shouldn 't stop you from empathizing with them the best thing that we could do for our loved ones is perhaps mind at some point thankfully we can often find them again but only with each other 's help thank you"
