  "transcript": "in israel i feel that i connect with and i feel that i 'm united with this country 's and also for me biking is a matter of i feel young it 's as if i 'm connecting with some legacy or with some energy far greater than myself you can see my fellow riders at the end of the picture looking at me with some neither can i and that 's because my fellow riders are juvenile inmates and for the last four years and by now they 've become a very big part of my life and it 's surrounded by barbed i told the warden that i wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place and that basically i wanted to take the kids from here and i told him let 's find a way in which i 'll be able to take out ten kids with in the summer in the country and the warden was quite amused and he told me he thought that i was a nut and he told me this place is a correction facility these guys are serious offenders they are supposed to be locked up they aren 't supposed to be out at large we began to talk about it and see myself going into a and so two months later we found ourselves at large myself ten juvenile inmates and a wonderful fellow named russ who became a very good friend of mine and my partner in this project the next few weeks i had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these everything you see here is obviously in israel as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes every small obstacle every slight uphill would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up so we had a lot of this going on i found out that they had a very hard time dealing with frustration and difficulties not because they were physically unfit and i became increasingly more and more agitated because i was there not only to be with them but also to ride and create a team and i didn 't know what to do now let me give you an example we and the front tire of alex gets caught in one of these crevasses here but this does not prevent him from jumping up and then starting to jump up and down on his bike then he throws his helmet in the air his backpack goes ballistic in some other direction and then he runs to the nearest tree and starts to break branches and throw rocks and and curse like i 've never heard watching this scene with a complete disbelief not knowing what to do i 'm used to algorithms and data structures and and violent adolescent in the middle of nowhere have to realize that these incidents did not happen in convenient locations they happened in places like this in the and what you don 't see in this picture is that somewhere between these riders there there 's a teenager sitting on a rock one way or another you have to get this guy moving because it 's getting dark soon and dangerous it took me several such incidents to figure out what i was supposed to do at the beginning it was a disaster i tried harsh words and threats and they took me nowhere that 's what they had all their lives and at some point i found out when a kid like this gets into a fit the best thing that you can possibly do is stay as close as possible to this kid which is people walking away from him so what you have to do is stay close i know that have to understand that on these rides we are constantly hungry and after the rides someone put him on a boat in odessa and he ended up in south tel aviv and did not have the good luck and he spent the last ten years of his life in two places only the slums and so this kid was probably ignored betrayed by almost every adult along the way when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him and doesn 't walk away from him in any situation it 's an act of when i started this program four years ago i had an image of lance armstrong in my mind and it took me exactly two months of complete frustration to realize that this vision was misplaced and that there was another vision supremely more a sudden dawned on me in this project that the purpose of these rides should actually be to expose the kids love to the country to the uphill and the downhill to all the incredible creatures that surround us the animals the plants the insects love and respect to other fellow members in love and respect to yourself which is something that they badly miss together with the kids i also went through a remarkable transformation now i come from a cutthroat world of science and i used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only and before i worked with the kids anything that i did with them optimal but after working with them for some time i discovered the great virtues of empathy and well nothing happened all you have to do is play with it change it a little bit and come up with something that does help that does work so right now i feel more like i have others focus before each ride we sit together with the kids and we give them one word to think about during the ride you have to focus their attention on something because so many things happen so these are words like teamwork or endurance or even complicated concepts word that they don 't understand you know perspective is one of these critically important life coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you i tell kids when they struggle through some uphill it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows it literally propels you upwards that 's what perspective is all about or you can also look back in time and realize that you 've already conquered steeper mountains before self esteem now let me give you an example of how it works you stand with your bike at the beginning of february it 's very cold and you 're standing in one of these rainy and you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds you see and you say there 's no way that i could possibly get there and yet two hours later you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery and you say hey alex look at this parking lot where we started it 's that big i can 't believe that i did it and that 's the point and so we talked about these special words that we teach them and at the end of we sit together and share moments in which those special words of the day popped up and made a difference and these discussions can be extremely inspiring in one of them one of the kids once said when we were riding on this ridge overlooking the dead sea and he 's talking about this spot here i was reminded of the day when i left my village in ethiopia and went away together with my brother one hundred and twenty kilometers until we reached sudan this was the first place where we got some water and supplies and he says who are sitting there listening to him and he says and this was just the beginning of of our and only now he says i 'm beginning to to understand where i am and i actually like it now i remember when he said it i felt goosebumps on my body because he said it overlooking the moab mountains here in the background that 's where joshua descended and crossed the jordan and led the people of of israel into the land of canaan three thousand years ago in this final leg of and so perspective and context and history play key roles in the way i plan my rides with the kids we visit kibbutzim that were established by holocaust survivors we explore and we discuss how they became canaanite settlements which is the history of this country the kids and that is the understanding that life is complex and tolerance leads to hope every tuesday here 's a picture i took last tuesday less than a week ago and i ride with them tomorrow and i feel and i feel blessed and fortunate that fifteen years ago i had the courage to resign my tenured position at nyu and return to my home country where of of troubled kids coming from ethiopia and and i feel blessed and fortunate that every week every tuesday and actually every friday also i can once again celebrate in the marrow of my bones the very essence of living in israel on the edge"
