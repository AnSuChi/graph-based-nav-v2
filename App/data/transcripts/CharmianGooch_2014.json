  "transcript": "come here today to talk to you about a problem it 's a very simple yet devastating problem one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us the problem is anonymous companies like a really dry and technical thing doesn 't it but anonymous companies are making it difficult and sometimes impossible to find out so why am i here i guess i am a lifelong troublemaker and when my parents taught my twin brother and i to question authority i don 't think they knew where it might lead laughter and they probably really regretted it during my stroppy teenage years when predictably i questioned their authority a lot and a lot of my school teachers didn 't appreciate it much and little did i realize that this question would become the basis of everything i would do and so it was in my twenties a long time ago one rainy sunday afternoon in north london i was sitting with simon taylor and patrick alley and we were busy stuffing envelopes for a mail out in the office of the campaign group and in particular we were talking about the civil war and we had talked about that many many times before but then suddenly we stopped and looked at each other but why don 't we try and change this and from that slightly crazy question over two decades and many campaigns later including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war from that crazy question global witness is now an 80 strong team and we 're all driven by the same belief that change really is possible so what exactly does global witness do we investigate we report to uncover the people really responsible for funding conflict for stealing millions and we 're doing this because so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet and much of this injustice is made possible and one of these now we 've come up against anonymous companies in lots of our investigations like in the democratic republic of congo where we exposed how secretive deals involving anonymous companies had deprived the citizens of one of the poorest countries on the planet of well over a billion dollars that 's twice the country 's health and education budget combined or in liberia where an international predatory logging company or political corruption in sarawak well that uses anonymous companies too we secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such and the awful thing is there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life whether it 's the ruthless mexican drugs cartel the zetas who use anonymous companies to launder profits while their tearing communities apart piled on the legal fees pay up or lose your home imagine being threatened with losing your home and not being able to find out who you were really up against now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too as the iranian government found out despite american sanctions unknowing tenants there there are just so many examples the they 've used these companies for decades the $ one hundred million american medicare fraud the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in eastern europe in the early ' 90s anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the ukraine but for every case that we and others expose and it 's just a simple truth that some of the people responsible for outrageous crimes for stealing from you and me and millions of others they are remaining faceless and they are escaping accountability and really that is unfair and can i really set one up and use it without anyone who i am so let me show you well first you need to work out where you want to set it up now at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens shockingly my own hometown london and indeed the u k is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company i 'm afraid that 's america do you know in some states across america which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company and now you can simply go online and find yourself a company service provider so here 's one but there are plenty of others to choose from and having made your choice you then pick what type of company you want and then fill in a it can be your lawyer 's and again it doesn 't have to be you because you can get creative because there is a whole universe out there of nominees to choose from and nominees are the people that you can legally pay to be your company 's owner give your company a name and then the service provider will take a few hours or more to process it but there you are in ten minutes of online shopping you can create yourself but the fun doesn 't have to end there maybe you want to be even more you can simply keep adding layers companies owned by companies you can have hundreds of layers with hundreds of companies spread across lots of different countries each layer makes it more difficult for law enforcement and others to find out who the real owner is but whose interests is this all serving it might be in the but what about all of us the public and what does it all mean for us well an example that really haunts me is one i came three thousand very happy revelers many of them teenagers were crammed into a space meant for one thousand so people tried to escape only to find that some of the fire doors had been chained shut seven hundred were injured trying to get out investigators tried to find out who was responsible they and confusion surrounded the identities of those involved with the companies and it shouldn 't have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths because in an age when there is so much information out there in the open why should this crucial information about company ownership stay hidden away the public why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice anonymous companies might be the norm right now companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line companies were created to limit financial risk they were never intended to be used as a moral shield companies were never intended to be anonymous and they don 't have"
