  "transcript": "what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to explain to you an extreme green concept that was developed at nasa 's glenn research center but before i do that we have to go over the definition of what green is ' cause a lot of us have a different definition of the product is created through environmentally and socially conscious means there 's plenty of things that are being called green now what does it actually mean which means are you preserving what you are doing for future use or for future generations now my task at nasa is to develop the next generation of aviation fuels extreme green why aviation the field of aviation uses more fuel than just about every other combined we need to find an alternative also it 's a national aeronautics directive one of the national aeronautics goals is to develop the next generation of fuels biofuels using domestic and safe friendly resources combating that challenge we have to also meet the big three metric actually extreme green for us is all three together that 's why you see the plus there i was told to say that ninety seven percent how about we use that combine that with number three do not use arable land because crops are already growing on that land that 's very scarce around the world number two and lastly the most precious resource we have on this earth don 't use fresh water less than a half percent of that is accessible for human use but sixty percent of the population lives within that one percent so combating my problem was now i have to be extreme green greenlab research facility this is a facility we also are using weeds and we are also using algae because we are on to something special so in the lower you see the greenlab obviously and on the right hand side you 'll see algae if you are into the business of the next generation of aviation fuels algae is a viable option there 's a lot of funding right now and we have an algae to fuels program and what you see on the other our job at nasa is to take the experimental and computational and make a better mixing for the closed photobioreactors so on large scale what do they use now around the world they are growing algae with but when it gets around the last turn which i call turn four we actually use wave technology on our open pond systems we have ninety five percent mixing and our content is higher than a closed system which we think is significant it 's very expensive is there a way to produce algae inexpensively and the answer is yes we do the same thing we do with have six primary ecosystems that range from freshwater all the way to saltwater when the second tank here will be the same ecosystem as brazil right next to the sugar cane fields you can have our plants the next tank represents africa the and the next tank represents california or the open ocean what we are trying to do is to come up with a single species that can survive we are being very successful so far you need and the last thing that you need is fertilizer most people use chemical fertilizers but guess what we do not use chemical fertilizer wait a second i just saw lots of greenery in your greenlab believe it or not in our analysis of our saltwater ecosystems eighty percent of what we need are in these tanks themselves the twenty percent that 's missing we have a natural solution fish no we don 't cut up the fish and put them in there fish waste is what we use as a matter of fact we use freshwater mollies that we 've used our climatic adaptation technique from freshwater all the way and the more they go to the bathroom the more fertilizer we get the better off we are believe it or not it should be noted that we use sand regular beach sand fossilized coral so a lot of people ask me how did you get started started in what we call the indoor biofuels lab it 's a seedling lab we have twenty six different species of halophytes and five are winners what we do here is actually it should be called a death lab ' cause we try to kill the seedlings make them rough and then we come to the greenlab what you see in the lower corner is a wastewater treatment plant experiment that we are growing a and lastly it 's me actually working in the lab to prove to you i do work i don 't just talk about what i do salicornia virginica everywhere we go we see it it 's all over the place from maine all the way to but it has a shortcoming it 's short and what we are trying to do with natural selection or adaptive biology combine all three when a hurricane decimated the delaware bay soybean fields gone we came up with an idea can you have a plant that has a land reclamation it 's called seashore mallow cattle feed it 's there for ten years it 's working very well now we get to chaetomorpha this is a macro algae that loves excess nutrients if you are in the aquarium industry you know we use it to clean up dirty tanks this species is so significant to us the properties are very close to plastic we are trying right now to convert this macro algae into a if we are successful we will revolutionize the plastics industry so we have a seed to fuel program we have to do something with this biomass that we have and so we do g c because our goal really is to come up with the next generation of aviation fuels aviation specifics so on and so forth so far we talked about water but along the way we found out something interesting about salicornia it how about this half use for fuel we can make that happen inexpensively you can see there 's a greenhouse in germany that sells it as a health food product and in the middle here is a shrimp dish and it 's being pickled so i have to tell you a joke salicornia is known as sea beans so we are pickling pickle weed in the middle oh i thought it was funny and at the bottom is seaman 's mustard it does make sense this is a logical snack you have mustard you are a seaman the halophyte you mix it together it 's a great snack with some crackers and last garlic with salicornia which is what i like fuel we have the big three at nasa grc that 's myself the backbone of the greenlab is students over the last two years we 've had thirty five different students from around the world working at greenlab as a matter fact my division chief says a lot you have a green which is significant so in first summary fuel there 's something missing we have a solution for you we 're using clean energy we are also using something that is quite interesting there is a solar array field at nasa 's glenn research center hasn 't been used for fifteen years along with some of my electrical engineering colleagues we realized that they are still viable so we are refurbishing them right now in about thirty days or so they 'll be connected to the greenlab and the reason why you see red red and yellow is a lot of people think nasa employees don 't work on saturday there are no cars around but you see my truck in yellow i ' cause we do what it takes to get the job done most people know that here 's a concept with this micro grid test bed we have the ability to do that and i think it 's going to work we really really hope this concept catches on worldwide we think we have a solution fuel and now energy don 't compete with food crops"
