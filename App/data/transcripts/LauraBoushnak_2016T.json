  "transcript": "it makes me i have this thought in the back of my mind that i might lose a limb this underlying fear started ten years ago after i met mohammed a cluster bomb survivor of the summer two thousand and six war in lebanon mohammed like so many other survivors all around the world had to live through when the one month conflict started i wanted to reassure myself that the falling bombs missed my parents ' home after they had finally managed to escape southern lebanon regardless of what they would find an estimated four million cluster submunitions were spread in lebanon during the 34 day conflict lost both legs during the last week of the conflict i saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends and i know the young jobless man who spends hours surfing the internet trying to meet a girl who might become his girlfriend his fate and the effects of losing his legs are now his daily reality survivors of bomb trauma like mohammed have to deal with so many details that never occur to us who have imagined that so many daily tasks we do or take for granted such as going to the beach or even picking up something from the floor well that 's what eventually became of mohammed due to his inflexible prosthetic legs i learned that this indiscriminate weapon was used in so many parts of the world and continues to kill without distinguishing between a military target and what for let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is it 's a large canister filled with bomblets when it 's dropped from the air it opens up in midair to release hundreds of bomblets these weapons are extremely unpredictable which makes the threat even bigger one day he can make fire and burn some branches and the submunitions close by could be set off because of the heat being a documentary and i met a few hussein and rasha who both lost a leg to submunitions their stories are similar to so many other kids ' stories across the world and are a testimony to the horrifying implications of the continuous use of such weapons he was eleven years old and i met him exactly four months after his accident when i first saw him he was going through painful physiotherapy to recover from his fresh wounds he would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet what drew me closer to his story was my instant realization of the difficulties mohammed was likely to face in the future that what he has been suffering while adjusting to his injury at the age of eleven would increase manyfold and this is where he still lives and they suffer from discriminatory laws they 're not allowed to work in the public sector or practice certain professions and are denied the right to own property he said what 's the point of a university degree when i can 't find a job cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle of impact on communities and not only the lives of their victims this is not to mention the continuous physical pain and the experience of feeling which is insufficient and unsustainable especially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured 's very cautious with his steps as a couple of falls over the years brought him embarrassment among his friends he joked that since he doesn 't have legs some days he tries to walk on his hands one of the worst yet invisible impacts of the weapon is the psychological scars it leaves he sleep disturbance and showed signs of anger the reality is mohammed never received proper help to fully recover his current obsession is to leave lebanon at any cost knowing how risky such a journey would be he said if i were he is dead here anyway cluster bombs are a world problem as this munition keeps destroying and hurting whole communities for generations to come in an online interview with the director of the the us forces dropped over two million tons of munitions over laos because it 's dangerous to land with loaded planes according to the international committee of the red cross in laos alone one of the poorest countries in the world nine to unexploded submunitions remain some eleven thousand people have been killed or injured since one thousand nine hundred and seventy three iraq and sudan but some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions namely the united states russia and china remain outside of this lifesaving treaty and continue to produce them reserve the right to produce them in the future keep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles and even possibly use them in the future cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently in the ongoing conflicts in yemen according to research on the worldwide investments in cluster munitions producers by pax financial institutions invested billions of us dollars into companies that make cluster munitions one of the few jobs he was able to find was picking lemons when i ask him if it 's safe to work in the field he said according to handicap international 's research ninety eight percent of those killed or injured by cluster munitions are civilians eighty four percent of casualties are males in countries where these people have no choice but to work in those fields they simply do it and risk but he simply can 't he tried to have so many different jobs but he couldn 't keep any due to his physical disability and the less than friendly environment to people with disabilities to say the least it hurts him a lot when he goes out looking for a he said i 'm not here to beg for money i just want to earn it and he communicates with voice messages here is one of his messages i would never stop"
