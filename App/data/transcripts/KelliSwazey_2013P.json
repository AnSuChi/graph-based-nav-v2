  "transcript": "but what if that intimacy began long before you faced your own what would life be like if the dead literally lived alongside you there is a community of people that experience death not as a singular event but as a gradual social process in tana the focal points of social and cultural interaction so these funerals are characterized by elaborate rituals that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt based on the amount of animals water buffalo the most visible lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks where commemorating someone who 's died and it 's a transition that 's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead so every year thousands of visitors come to tana toraja to see as it were this culture of death and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies so even as we share death as a universal experience same way the world over and as an anthropologist i see these differences in experience being rooted in the cultural and social world through which we define the phenomena around us so where we see an death as an irrefutable biological condition so again the physical cessation of life is not the same as death in fact a member of society is only truly dead when the extended family can agree upon and marshal the their body is placed in a special room in the traditional residence which is called the tongkonan and the tongkonan is symbolic not only of the family 's identity until the funeral ceremony which can be held years after a person 's physical death the deceased is referred to as to makala a sick person and they continue to be a member of the household they are symbolically fed and cared for and the family at this time will begin a number of ritual injunctions which communicates to the wider community around them that one of their members is undergoing the transition from this life so i know what some of you must be thinking right now and that 's exactly what i 'm saying i like to think about what the torajan way of viewing death encompasses of the human experience that the medical definition leaves out i think that torajans socially recognize and culturally express what many of us feel to be true and that is that our relationships with other humans their impact on our social reality doesn 't cease with the termination of the physical processes of the body that there 's a period of transition as the relationship between the living and the dead is transformed so torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship by lavishing love and for him there is nothing unnatural about this this is a natural part of the process as the family comes to terms with the transition in their and this is the transition from relating to the deceased as a person who 's living so these are people who have already been buried already had a funeral ceremony so the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational and it 's also a moment of it 's a moment when people think about who they are their place in society and their role in the life cycle in accordance with torajan cosmology we all become part of the ancestral line that anchors us between the past and the present and will define who our loved ones are into the future so essentially we all become grandparents to the generations of human children that come after us and this metaphor of membership in the greater human family is the way that children also describe the money that they invest in these sacrificial buffaloes that are thought to carry people 's soul from here to the afterlife and children will explain that they will invest the money in this because they want to repay their parents the debt for all of the years their parents spent investing and caring for them but the sacrifice of buffalo the deceased 's family relationships are reconfirmed but also transformed in a ritual drama that highlights the most salient feature about its impact on life and the relationships of the living so all of this focus on death doesn 't mean that torajans don 't aspire to the ideal of a long life but they don 't put much stock in in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness it 's said in toraja that everybody has sort of a predetermined amount of life it 's called the sunga ' so by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabric nenet katcha and there are increasing signs that he is about to depart on his own journey for puya and his death will be greatly mourned but i know that my husband 's family looks forward to the moment when they can ritually display weaving his story into the history of their community his story is their story it 's a story that goes on long after his body no longer does people ask me if i 'm frightened or repulsed by but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a where decisions about how long to stretch the thread of life are made based on our emotional and social ties with the people around us not just on medicine 's ability to prolong life we like the torajans base our decisions about life on the meanings so i 'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the torajans it might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the united states but i want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story what would it be like to look on the expired human form with love we could experience death as part of life and perhaps face death with something other than fear perhaps one of the answers to the challenges that are facing the u s healthcare system particularly in the end of life care is as simple as a shift in perspective and the shift in perspective in this case would be to look at the social life of every it might help us recognize that the way we limit our conversation about death to something that 's medical or biological is reflective of a larger culture that we all share of avoiding death being afraid of talking about it if we could entertain and value including other definitions of death it could transform the way that we live"
