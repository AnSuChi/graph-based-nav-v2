  "transcript": "last few years i 've been had the opportunity to do this closing conference billy graham opened for me and i thought that there was i thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that but i just wanted to say and i mean this without irony i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states this is the title of my talk today first of all please remember i 'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with now is the time to check your blackberry just to review this is my tedtalk we 're going to do some jokes some gags some little skits and then we 're going to talk about the l1 point let 's try and sum things up shall we images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox twenty one percent of the conference images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu and if the if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then we 're going to have a scream bag next year cradle to cradle scream bag of course so you 're going to be able to go like this back at ted university this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips so robert wright i don 't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels he was talking about business class morality is don 't bomb japan they built my car and first class morality is don 't bomb mexico they clean my house yes it is politically incorrect i wanted to show you guys i wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you as a completely natural user interface and you can you can use really natural hand gestures to like go like this now we had a harvard professor here she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and and she was actually and then there 's my weak brain which is too too absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about now one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here and and it 's called the porpoise driven life and rick is as which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and now we 're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren ok and then this is books sold the logarithmic scale and his installed base is getting a little bigger but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back one of the things that 's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per i 'm sorry now let 's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device i 'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i 'll show it to you in person first very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across many platforms now we 've actually done some research neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market they did some research we came back and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually actually asking for and here it is i bought this device from clifford stoll for about nine hundred bucks so we 're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana see who uses marijuana only if we open enough locker doors now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had dr larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox we start this is day one day four day five and day six now the good news is because i 'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she 'll be scarred for life she 's going to make a full recovery they 've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions and they 've had a design competition now the wonderful thing is larry brilliant was just appointed the head of the google foundation and so he decided that he would support he would support cameron 's work and the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over fifty thousand shipping containers of google snacks laughter so i want to show you some prototypes the u n you know they took twenty years just but i think we have some more exciting things this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll ups those roll up cookies coated with white chocolate and the really wonderful thing about this is when you 're done well but the thing that i 'm really really excited about is this incredible granola house and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it and it 's well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly and we we wanted to show you what this might look like in situ could you say that again what 's your favorite singing group one more time i 'm just going to give you a little help your favorite singing group it 's diana ross and the audience supremes tom exactly could we have the sound up on the laptop please now it 's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to so i wanted to help you a little bit we 've talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said it sounds kind of nice good so i 've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace global warming so we started with babel fish we put in global warming and then we decided that we 'd change it from english to dutch into het globale verwarmen from dutch to we 're totally fucked now i don 't know about you but michael shermer talked about the willingness for human beings evolutionarily they 're designed to see patterns in things for example in cheese sandwiches now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary i tried to make it a little bit clearer so i talked to josh prince ramus about the convention center and the conferences it 's getting awfully big it 's getting just a little bit too big it 's bursting at the seams here a little bit so we tried to come up with a program how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted so first of all we decided that we needed about one third bookstore one third google cafe about twenty percent registration eighty percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms and then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program so we build this building on stilts then up here is where we 're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium and the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is it 's going to be shaped in a spiral that 's 're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there and finally we 're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top i immediately go and i want you to write a terrorist note if we put up the elmo for a moment if we put up the elmo then give you a model that you can work from ok and once you 've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax and then i want you to throw it on jim young and i wanted to see i want to dedicate this film to so i wanted to going to try and do this while reciting pi we cue the music please now i wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit back you can see that the mountain range of brokeback mountain was covered in one hundred and fifty one inches of snow pack parenthetically over there on the slopes i did want to show you that black men ski but over the years the water level of the lake has started drying up a few years later there 's no snow left at all and all the trees have turned brown unfortunately the lakebed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in twenty years it 's going to look like this vice president i wish i knew how to quit you"
