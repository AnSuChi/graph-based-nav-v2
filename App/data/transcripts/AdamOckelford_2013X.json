  "transcript": "i promise there won 't be too much of me talking and a lot of derek playing but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today it 's amazing now because he 's so much bigger than and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive he had to have a lot of oxygen and that affected your eyes derek and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world but that was the end of the bad news because when derek came came home from the hospital his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood and nanny 's great insight really was to think or as derek called it warbled to him for him for his first few years of life and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after every day that made him think maybe you know in his brain something was stirring some sort of musical here 's a little picture of derek going up now when you were with your nanny now nanny 's great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek something and sure enough she dragged this little bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break but and i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard that was the great eureka moment now not being able to see meant of course that you taught yourself derek paravicini i taught myself to play ao you did teach yourself to play and and now here 's what nanny did also do was to press the record button on one of those little and this is a wonderful tape now of derek playing when you were four years old little child who can 't see can 't really understand much about the world has no one in the family who plays an instrument and yet he taught himself to play that and as you can see from the picture there was quite a lot of body action going on while you were playing derek along derek and i met when he was four and a half years old and and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way so as soon as i tried to get near the piano shoved off and having said to to your dad nic that i would try to teach you i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasn 't but after a while i thought well the only way is to just pick you up and in the end i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the playing the piano together as you can see there 's me in my and little derek concentrating there i just realized this is going to be recorded isn 't it right okay this is a photo of you playing at the barbican with the royal philharmonic pops basically it was it was just an exciting journey really and in those days derek you didn 't speak very much and so there was always a moment of tension as to whether you 'd actually understood what it was we were going to play and whether you 'd play the right piece in the right key and all that kind of thing but the orchestra were wowed as well and the press of the world were fascinated by your to play these fantastic pieces now the question is how do you do it derek and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do i think that one of the first things that happened when when you were very little derek was that and so whenever you heard any note at all if i just play a random note you knew instantly what it was and you 'd got the ability as well to find that note now that 's called perfect pitch and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes in the middle of the piano your ear is so much more than that if i just put the microphone down for a bit i 'm going to play a cluster of notes those of you who can see will know how many notes but derek of course can 't not only can you say how many notes it 's being able to play them all at the that ability that ability to hear simultaneous sounds not only just single sounds but when a whole orchestra is playing derek you can hear now then it 's no use having and luckily derek you decided that once we did start learning you 'd let me help you learn all the scale fingerings so for and in the end you got so quick that things like flight of the bumblebee playing things like this the you could not in your brain derek is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalculate all the pieces in the world that are out there most pianists would have a heart attack if you said sorry do you mind playing ' flight of the bumblebee ' in b minor instead of a minor you 'd learned the version that you 'd learned and then the orchestra did have a different version so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to fantastic chap the other wonderful thing about you is memory dp memory ao your memory is truly amazing and every concert we do we ask the audience you 're invited to come and sing it first and then he 'll pick it up but seriously would anyone like to the now then which i think is just missing the point really because derek and someone in a longer concert we we tend to get people joining in and this person very very nervously came onto the stage i should really get derek 's manager to come and play it he 's sitting there okay the and here is derek 's take on art tatum the for"
