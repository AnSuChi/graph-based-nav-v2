  "transcript": "boring word but it 's actually quite exciting because ichthyology is the only ology with yolo to the cool kids in the audience you already know yolo stands for you only live once and it turns out there 's lots of new cavefish species out there you just have to know where to look and to maybe be a little thin now cavefishes can tell me a lot about biology and geology by being blind now fish have eyes that are essentially the same as ours all vertebrates and each time a fish species starts to adapt to this dark cold cave environment and that 's why it 's so exciting when we find a new species so this is a new there 's this gene called rhodopsin that 's super critical for sight we have it and these species have it too species has lost all function in that gene and the other one maintains it but the genes in these cavefishes can also tell us about deep geological time maybe no more so than in this species here this is a new species we described from madagascar that we named swimming around sinkholes full of dead things and cave full of bat poop isn 't the smartest thing you could be doing with your life and that 's because this species in madagascar its closest relatives are six thousand kilometers away cavefishes in australia now there 's no way a three inch long freshwater cavefish can swim across the indian ocean or about the time that the southern continents southern continents were last together so in fact these species didn 't move at all it 's the continents that moved them and so they give us through their dna this precise model and measure of how to date and time these ancient geological events now this species here is so new i 'm not even allowed to tell you its name and it 's probably already extinct we actually don 't know this species ' closest relative yet it doesn 't appear to be anything else in mexico and i 'm going to spend my one life as an ichthyologist trying to discover and save these humble little blind cavefishes that can tell us so much about the geology of the planet thank you"
