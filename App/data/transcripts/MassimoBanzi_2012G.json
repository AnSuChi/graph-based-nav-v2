  "transcript": "but instead of going into a store and then he printed it on this printer so this idea that you can manufacture objects digitally using these machines is something that the economist magazine defined as the third industrial revolution because the printer that my friend used to print the toy is actually so you go to the same website you can download all the files that you need in order to make the software all the instruction is there and also this is part of a large community where there are thousands of people around the world that are actually making these kinds of printers and there 's a lot of innovation happening because it 's all don 't need anybody 's permission to create something great and that space is like the personal computer in one thousand nine hundred and seventy six like the apples with the other companies are fighting and we will see in a few years there will be the apple of this kind of market come out well there 's also another interesting thing i said the electronics are open source because at the heart of this printer there is something i 'm really attached to these arduino boards the motherboard that sort of powers this printer is a project i 've been working on for the past seven years it 's an open source project i worked with with these friends of mine that i have here so the five of us two americans two italians it 's a so we came together which was teaching interaction design this idea that you can take design from the simple shape of an object and you can move it forward to design the way you interact with things it doesn 't make any sense you have to have something that actually interacts worked on arduino and a lot of other projects there to create platforms that would be simple for our students to use so that our students could just build things that worked but they don 't have five years to become an electronics engineer we have one month so how do i make something that even a kid can use and actually with arduino we have kids like sylvia that you see here that actually make projects with arduino kids stop me and show me stuff they built for arduino that 's really scary to see the capabilities that kids have when you give them so let 's look at what happens when you make a tool that anybody can just pick up and build something quickly so one of the examples that i like to sort of kick off this the gentleman who made this project had two cats one was sick and the other one was healthy so he had to make sure they ate the proper food so he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat and opens the door and the cat can eat the food this is made by recycling an old cd player that you can get from an old computer some cardboard tape couple of sensors a few blinking leds and then suddenly you have a tool you build something that you cannot find on the market like this phrase scratch your own itch if you have an idea you just go and you make it this is the equivalent of sketching on paper done with electronics so one of the features that i think is important about our work is that our hardware on top of being made with love in italy as you can see from the back of the circuit is that so we publish all the design files so you can download it and you can actually use it to make something or to modify to learn you know when i was learning about programming i learned by looking at other people 's code or looking at other people 's circuits in magazines and this is so the different elements of the project are all open so the hardware is released with a creative commons license so you know i like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon like it was a song or a poem with creative commons the documentation and the hands on teaching methodology is also open source and released as the creative commons just the name is protected so that we can make sure that we can tell people what is arduino and what isn 't now arduino itself is made of a lot of different so arduino wraps everything together into a mashup of open source technologies so you have situations like this where some people in chile decided to make their own boards instead of buying them to organize a workshop and to save money maybe like a one hundred and fifty of them or something at the moment this one is made which is run by this woman called limor fried also known as ladyada who is one of the heroes of the open source hardware movement and the maker movement so this idea that you have a new sort of collaborates online collaborates in different spaces there is this magazine called make that sort of gathered all these people and sort of put them together as a community and you see a very technical project explained or you have websites like this one like instructables where people actually teach each other about anything so this one is about arduino projects the page you see on the screen but effectively here you can learn how to make a cake and everything else so it 's a small model helicopter in a way it 's a toy but then somebody actually launched this start up called matternet where they figured out that you could use this to actually transport things from one village to another in africa and the fact that this was easy to find open source easy to hack enabled them so i decided to do something about it this arduino project which i call the enough already will mute the tv anytime any of these our producers caught up with kim kardashian earlier today to find out what she was planning on wearing to her mb eh mr it should do a pretty good job of protecting our ears from having to hear about the details of kim kardashian 's wedding mb again what is interesting here is that matt found this module lets arduino process tv signals he found some code written by somebody else that generates infrared signals for the tv put it together and then created this great project it so this is a musical interface built by a student from italy because it was a student project becoming a product or it can be used to make an assistive device this is a glove that understands the sign language and transforms the gestures you make into sounds and writes the words that you 're signing on a display and again this is made of all different parts you can find on all the websites that sell or this is a project from the itp part of nyu where they met with this boy who has a severe disability cannot play with the ps3 so they built this device that allows the kid to play baseball although he has limited so you put a message into this device and then you roll it on the wall so you just pull it over a wall and it just writes on the wall all the political messages and it 's measuring the well being of the plant and it 's creating a twitter account where you can actually this plant will start to say this is really hot or there 's a lot of baby inside the belly of a pregnant woman kicks or this is a 14 year old kid in chile who made a system that detects earthquakes and publishes on twitter he has two hundred and eighty thousand followers he 's fourteen and he anticipated a governmental project by one year applause or or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts it 's interesting how in two thousand and nine gizmodo basically defined said that this project actually gives a meaning to twitter so it so very serious project when the fukushima disaster happened plus arduino plus network and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called cosm another website they built or this machine here it 's from the diy bio movement or you have students in developing countries making replicas of scientific instruments that cost a lot of money to make actually they just build and then they started to use arduino to make these robots that play football they became world champions by making an arduino based robot and so when we had to make our own educational robot we just went to them and said you know you design it because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids not me i 'm an old guy what am i supposed to excite huh but as i in terms of educational assets there 's also companies like google that are using the technology to create interfaces between mobile phones tablets and the real world so the accessory development kit from google based on arduino as opposed to the one from apple which is sign your life to apple here you are there 's a giant maze and joey 's sitting there and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet also i come from italy and the design is important in italy and yet very so we worked with a design studio called habits in milan to make this mirror which is completely open source this doubles also as an ipod so the idea is that the so we want other designers to pick this up and learn how to make great but when you have this you know what happens to all these ideas there 's like thousands of ideas that i you know it would take seven hours for me to do all the presentations thank you but let 's start from this example so the group of people that started this company called pebble they prototyped a watch that via bluetooth with your phone and you can display information on it and they prototyped with an old lcd screen from a nokia mobile phone and an arduino and then when they had a final project they actually went to kickstarter and they were asking for one hundred thousand dollars they got a completely fully funded start up and they don 't have and it contains an arduino connected to a bunch of sensors so if you know how to use arduino you can actually upload your experiments into this satellite if you as a high school can have the satellite for a week and do satellite satellite space experiments like that and just every day making lots of you told me earlier today that you had no idea of course that it would take off like this mb no ca i mean how must you feel when you read this stuff and you see what you 've unlocked it 's just it 's difficult to describe this every morning i wake up and i look at all the stuff that google alerts sends me and it 's just amazing it 's just going into every field that you can imagine"
