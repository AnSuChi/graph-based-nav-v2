  "transcript": "it come from what do we do about it well for most adults it 's a relatively mild disease a little fever a little headache maybe a rash in fact most people who get it don 't even know they 've had it but the more we find out about the zika virus the more terrifying it becomes for example doctors have noticed an uptick of something called guillain barr syndrome in recent outbreaks in but if you 're pregnant when you 're infected you 're at risk of something terrible indeed a child with a deformed head here 's a normal baby here 's that infant with what 's called a brain in a head that 's too small and there 's no known cure it was actually doctors in northeastern brazil who first noticed just a year ago outbreak that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly it took medical doctors another year to be sure that it was caused by the check out this publication like many of our viruses it came out of africa specifically the zika forest researchers at the nearby yellow fever research institute identified an unknown virus in a monkey in the the zika forest which is how it got its name the first human cases of zika fever surfaced a few years later in india but it was still mostly in monkeys and of course mosquitoes in fact in the sixty years between the time it was first identified in one thousand nine hundred and forty seven and then something extraordinary happened on the tiny micronesian yap islands there was an outbreak that of the population how did it get there by air today we have two billion commercial airline passengers an infected passenger can board a plane fly halfway around the world before developing symptoms if they develop symptoms at all then when they land the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever fever then next surfaced in two thousand and thirteen in french polynesia by december of that year it was being transmitted locally by the mosquitoes that led to an explosive outbreak in which almost thirty thousand people were affected from there it radiated around the pacific there were outbreaks in the cook islands in new caledonia in vanuatu in the solomon islands and almost all the way around to the coast of south america and easter island and then in early two thousand and fifteen there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue like syndrome in the city of natal in northeastern brazil the virus wasn 't dengue it was zika and it spread down the coast a big metropolitan center soon became the epicenter but others have speculated that perhaps it was pacific islanders participating in championship canoe races that were held in rio that year that brought it in the virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes virtually throughout south america central america mexico and the caribbean islands it 's being transmitted so what do we do about it well preventing infection is either about protecting people or about eliminating the mosquitoes let 's focus on people first you can get vaccinated you can not travel to zika areas or you can cover up and apply getting vaccinated is not an option because there isn 't a vaccine yet and there probably won 't be for a couple of years staying home isn 't a foolproof protection either because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted covering up and applying insect repellent does work until you forget so that leaves the mosquitoes and here 's how we control them now spraying insecticides the protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs although it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug these are pictures from brazil and nicaragua but it looks the same in miami florida and we of course can spray insecticides from planes summer authorized spraying of naled an insecticide early one morning as recommended by the manufacturer later that day a beekeeper told reporters that her bee yard looked like it had unfortunately so did the increase in the number of zika fever cases that 's because insecticides aren 't very effective so are there any approaches that are perhaps more effective than spraying but with less downsides than toxic chemicals i 'm a huge fan of biological controls and i share that view with rachel carson author of silent spring the book that is credited with starting the environmental movement in this book she tells the story as an example of how a very nasty insect pest of livestock was eliminated in the last century no one knows that extraordinary story today so jack block and i when we were writing an editorial about the mosquito problem today retold that story and in capsule form it 's that pupae that 's the immature form of the insect were irradiated until they were sterile grown to adulthood and then released from planes all over the southwest the southeast and down into mexico and into central america literally by the hundreds of millions from little airplanes eventually eliminating that terrible insect pest for most of the western hemisphere our real purpose in writing this editorial was introduce readers to how we can do that today not with radiation but with our knowledge of genetics let me explain this is the bad guy aedes aegypti it 's the most common insect vector of diseases not just zika but dengue chikungunya west nile virus and it 's the female that does the dirty work she bites to get a blood meal to feed her offspring males don 't bite they don 't even have the mouth parts to bite a little british company called oxitec genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female its eggs don 't develop to adulthood let me show you this is the normal reproductive cycle oxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female the eggs don 't develop sounds impossible and that tangle in the middle represents its genome the sum total of its genes scientists added a single gene that codes for a protein represented by this orange ball that feeds back on itself the extra copies however go and gum killing the organism to keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline tetracycline shuts off that gene and that is they added a gene that makes the insect glow under uv light so that when they released it they could follow exactly how far it went how long it lived and all of the kinds of data for a good scientific study now this is the pupal stage and at this stage the females are larger than the males that allows them to sort them into the males and the females and they allow only the males to grow to adulthood and let me remind you that males don 't bite from there it 's pretty simple they take beakers full load them into milk cartons and drive around the city releasing them guided by gps here 's the mayor of a city releasing the first batch of what they call the friendly aedes now i wish i could tell you this is an american city but it 's not it brought down the cases of dengue by percent that 's better than any insecticide spraying can do that 's because it 's a gmo notice the subtitle here says if the fda would let them so now i have to tell you torturous story of gm regulation in the us in the us there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms took these folks two years to decide that it would be the fda that would regulate the genetically modified mosquito and they would do it took them another five years going and forth and back and forth to convince the fda permission to run a little test in the florida keys where they had been invited years earlier when they keys it were that easy when the local residents heard that there would be genetically modified mosquitoes tested in their community some of them began to organize protests they even organized a petition on the internet with this cuddly logo which eventually accumulated some one hundred and sixty thousand signatures and they demanded a referendum which will be conducted in just a couple of weeks about whether the trials would be permitted at all well it 's miami that really needs these better ways of controlling insects and there the attitudes are changing in fact very recently a bipartisan group of more than sixty legislators wrote to hhs secretary sylvia burwell asking that she at the federal level expedite access for florida so the bottom line is this biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using what 's different is that we have enormously more information about genetics than we had then and therefore more ability to use that information and i hope that what i 've done is aroused your curiosity enough to start your own inquiry not into just gm mosquitoes but to the other genetically modified i think if you do that and you dig down through all of the misinformation and the marketing on the part of the organic food industry and the greenpeaces the accurate science you 'll be surprised and pleased"
