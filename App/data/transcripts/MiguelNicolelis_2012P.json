  "transcript": "the kind of neuroscience that i do and my colleagues do is almost like the weatherman we are always chasing storms we want to see and measure storms brainstorms but we rarely see or listen to one so i always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them actually the first time we recorded more than one neuron a hundred brain cells simultaneously we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal this is the first image we got the first ten seconds of this recording so we got a little snippet of a thought we could see it in front of us because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe and here we are out of billions of neurons just recording ten years a hundred we are doing a thousand now and we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains everything that every human has ever done do or will do requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms and the sound of a brainstorm if you 've never heard one is somewhat like this you can put it louder if you can my son calls this making your brain will sound like this any brain and what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies brain symphonies and try to extract from them the messages they carry in particular about twelve years ago we created a preparation that we named brain machine interfaces and you have a scheme here that describes how it works and see if you can in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal extract the motor messages that are embedded in it translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain and see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that and if we can actually back to the brain how the brain deals with that of receiving messages from and that 's exactly what we did ten years ago we started with a superstar monkey called aurora that became one of the superstars of this field as you can see here she likes to use a joystick like any one of us any of our kids to play this game and as a good primate she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer so even before a target appears that she 's supposed to cross with the cursor that she 's controlling with this joystick aurora is trying to find the target no matter where it is actually any primate will do that think about that well while aurora was playing this game as you saw and doing a thousand trials a day and getting we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that aurora was making because the idea was to actually turn on this brain machine interface and have aurora play the game just by thinking would move the cursor and cross the target and to our shock that 's exactly what aurora did she played the game so every trajectory that you see of the cursor now this is the exact first moment she got that that 's the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from of a body of a primate and could act outside in that outside world kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get that she craved for well she did that because she at that time had acquired a after the first video that i showed to you is under the control of aurora 's brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target and aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm but she has not lost she the model of the self that aurora had in her mind has been expanded just fast forward ten years just last year we realized that you don to have a robotic device you can just build a computational body an avatar a monkey avatar and you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar 's arms or what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world and these objects but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects and in just four weeks the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway like a new sense and you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar you 're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets and he has to select one because only one carries and he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm an arm that doesn 't and that 's exactly what they do this is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task the animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets and he 's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain and the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward the legends that you see in the movie don 't appear for the monkey and by the way so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position and yet they can find them by tactile discrimination and they can press it and select it so when we look at the brains of these animals on the top panel you see the alignment of one hundred and twenty five cells showing what happens with the brain activity the electrical storms of this sample of neurons in and that 's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows the basic alignment shows that these the bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar as fast as we can reset our computers the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool as if this too was a part of that primate 's body so that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we 're commanding with our brains our violins our cars our bicycles our soccer balls our clothing they all become assimilated by this voracious how far can we take it well in an experiment that we ran a few years ago we took this to the limit we had an animal running on a treadmill at duke university on the east coast of the united states producing the brainstorms necessary to move and we had a robotic device a humanoid robot in kyoto japan at atr laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain or a primate brain what happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her so she could be rewarded not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity funny thing that round trip around the globe took twenty milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head the head of the monkey and reach its own muscle across the planet this is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously this is cb1 fulfilling its dream in japan besides studying well the idea is to take all this knowledge millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action into movement although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord create a bypass is to use these brain machine interfaces to read these signals larger scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body a whole body called an exoskeleton and you can see an image produced by this consortium this is a nonprofit consortium called the walk again project that is putting together scientists from europe from here in the united states and in brazil together to work to actually get this new body built same plastic mechanisms that allow aurora and other monkeys to use these tools brain machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life we hope will allow these patients not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls and i was five years old and i never understood why nasa didn 't hire captain kirk and spock to do the job after all they were very proficient as my grandmother used to tell me that impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true thank you"
