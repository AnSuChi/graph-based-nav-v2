  "transcript": "have a studio in berlin let me cue on here which is down there in this snow just last weekend i would consider the studio more like a laboratory i have occasional meetings with scientists and i have an academy life in space is really not necessarily about how we do things but why we do things so you will have a yellow circle and we will do an goes away you will have another color the complementary color i am saying something and your eyes and your brain are saying something back this whole idea of sharing the idea of constituting reality by overlapping what i say and what you say think of a movie since two years now with some stipends from the science ministry in berlin i 've been working on these films where we produce the i think there is a socializing dimension in kind of moving that border who decides what reality is the show was in a sense about that it was about a space in which i put half a semi circular yellow disk i also put a mirror in the ceiling and some fog some haze with such a big space the problem is obviously that discrepancy between what your body can embrace and what the space in that sense is so here i had the hope that by inserting some natural elements if you want some fog and what happens is that people they start to see themselves in this space so look at this look at the girl of course they have to look through a bloody camera in a museum that was my foot there she wasn 't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not and in that whole idea how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space how do we reconfigure it how do we know that being in a space makes a difference do you see when i said in the beginning it 's about why rather than how the why really what consequences does it have when i take a step what does it matter does it matter if i am in the world or not and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take it is obviously about not just about decorating the world and making it look even better or even worse if you ask me it among other places the green dye is not environmentally dangerous but it obviously looks really rather frightening and it 's on the other side also i think quite beautiful as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas in these different places of the world in this city as they walk by that space has the water has an ability to negotiable meaning that it makes a difference whether you do something or not it makes a difference whether you say i 'm a part of this city and if i vote it makes a difference if i take a stand it makes a difference this whole idea of a always was working with the idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship between what is the difference lower right corner my favorite place these kinds of experiments they filter into one is an experiment i did for bmw an attempt to make a car it 's made out of ice a crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top which i am trying to turn into a concert hall in iceland a sort of a run track or a walk track on the top of a museum in denmark which is made of colored glass and two summers at the hyde park in london with the serpentine gallery a kind of a temporal pavilion where moving was the only way you could see the pavilion i 've walked if you stand and if you stop again you wonder is that a right out there at the you look at the waterfall and you go oh the water is falling really slowly and you go my god it 's really far away and it 's a giant waterfall if a waterfall is falling it 's a smaller waterfall which is closer by because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere and your body somehow knows that so this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space of course being an iconic city like new york had an interest in somehow playing around with the sense of space you could say that new york wants to seem as big as possible adding a measurement brooklyn is exactly this much the distance between brooklyn and manhattan in this case the lower east river is this big so it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities it was also about giving the city a sense of dimension and why would we want to do that because i think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture and ha ha there is a picture and here is i and what does it matter if i feel there is time if there is a dimension i could call time one could say this is about how do we create create public space what does the word public mean today anyway so asked in that being together being individual and also to collectivity without polarizing the two into two different opposites of course the political agendas in the world has been very obsessed polarizing the two against each other into different very normative ideas between thinking and doing"
