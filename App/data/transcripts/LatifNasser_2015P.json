  "transcript": "she 's a now one summer day in two thousand and six she was at a dig site called the fyles leaf bed which is less than ten degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your gps and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil ln and at some point she noticed something nr rusty kind of it was just lying on the surface ln and at first she thought it was just a fyles leaf bed before prehistoric plant parts but back at camp nr i get out the hand lens i 'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn 't quite look like this has tree rings maybe it 's a preservation thing but it looks really like bone ln huh so over the next four years she went to that spot over and over and eventually collected thirty most of them really tiny nr it 's not a whole lot it but it was challenging nr it 's broken up into so many little tiny pieces i 'm trying to use sand and kind of magical when it all fits together ln how certain were you that you had it right that you had put it together in the right way was there a potential that you 'd put it together a different way and have like a parakeet or what she had she discovered was a tibia a leg bone and specifically one that belonged to so something like a cow or a sheep but it couldn 't have been either of those it was just too big nr the size of this thing it was huge it 's a really big and they had an idea nr we took and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it ln it smelled kind of like it was a smell that natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab collagen collagen is what gives structure to our bones and usually after so many years it breaks down but in this case the arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it then a year or two later natalia was at a conference in bristol and she saw that turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone you can compare it to those of known species and so she shipped him one of the fragments and he processed it and compared it to it turns out that the three point five bone that natalia had dug out of the high arctic belonged to and i 'm thinking what that 's amazing if it 's true ln so they tested a bunch of the fragments and they got the same result for each one yeah natalia had found a giant arctic camel when you hear the word camel what may come to mind is one of these the bactrian camel of east and central asia but chances are the postcard image you have in your brain is one of these quintessential desert creature so how on earth would one of these guys end up in the high arctic well have known for a long time turns out even before natalia 's discovery that camels are actually originally american they started here for nearly forty maybe more ln if i put them all in a lineup would they look different nr yeah you 're going to have different body sizes you 'll have some with really long necks so they 're actually functionally like giraffes ln some had snouts like crocodiles nr the really primitive early and then around the end of the last ice age north american camels went extinct so but it still doesn 't fully explain how natalia found one so far north like this is temperature wise the polar opposite of the sahara now to be fair three and a half million years ago it was on average so it would have been boreal forest so more like the yukon or siberia today but still like they would have six month long winters where the ponds would freeze over you 'd have blizzards you 'd have twenty four hours a day of straight darkness it that one of these saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions laughter natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer and it 's kind of brilliant what if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well suited to places like the sahara actually evolved to help it get through the winter what if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand but over snow like a pair of snowshoes does not contain water it contains fat six month long winter when food was scarce and then only later long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment like for instance the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place like a you know fat backpack so it helps heat dissipate easier this crazy idea that what seems like proof of the camel 's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its high arctic past i 'm not the first person to tell this story others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change but i love it for a totally different reason so and i 've learned that actually a lot of scientists are historians too they make sense of the past they tell the history of our universe of our planet of life on and as a historian you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes nr we make up stories and we stick with it like the camel in the desert right that 's a great story it 's totally adapted for that clearly it always lived there ln you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence you could learn some tiny thing that forces you to and because of that science dr seuss looking creature looks the way it does it went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment to being this this world traveler that that just happens to be in the sahara and could end up virtually anywhere on a break from her regular gig 's not even a joke anyway but really azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one it requires our willingness to readjust to we 're all just one shard of bone away from seeing the world anew"
