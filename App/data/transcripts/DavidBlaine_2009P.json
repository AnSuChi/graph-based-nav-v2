  "transcript": "i also try to challenge myself to do things that i was buried alive in new york city in a coffin buried alive in a coffin in april for a week and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue doing more of these things the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city that one was way more difficult than i had expected so next i went to london in london i lived in a glass box for forty four days with nothing but water it was for me one of the most difficult things i 'd ever done but it was especially the press in london that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me so i felt very validated when the new england journal of medicine actually used the research for science my next pursuit was i wanted to see how long i could go without breathing like how long i could survive with nothing not even air i didn 't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life seeing how long i could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe i would later find out that was houdini 's personal record in one thousand nine i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice ice and was trapped under a river he when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage his core temperature had dropped to seventy seven degrees and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by i started to think if the boy could survive without breathing for that long there must be a way that i could do it so i met with a top neurosurgeon and i asked him how long is it possible to go without breathing like how long could i go without air and he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk so i took that as a challenge basically and i filled it with ice so i realized that was completely not going to work i went to talk to a doctor friend and i asked him how could i create the illusion of not breathing it will be much easier which was basically that he thought we could put inside of me and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this this is a little hard to watch but this is that attempt so that clearly wasn 't going to work and it 's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it so i got my hands on that chemical filled the sink up with it and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in which was really impossible it 's would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine which was another insane idea obviously then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it to actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain i started researching into pearl divers you know because they go down for four minutes on one breath and when i was researching pearl divers i found the world of free diving it was the most amazing thing that i ever discovered pretty much there is there is depth records where people go as deep as they can and then there is static apnea that 's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving and that depletes oxygen and it builds up co2 in your blood so i i had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that i wasn 't in my body and just control that purging is basically hyperventilating you blow in and out breathing and you 're really ridding your body of when you hold your breath it 's infinitely easier then i learned that you have to take a huge breath and just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain this is for months i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath for and i would hold immediately after for five and a half minutes purging as hard as i can then immediately after that i would hold again for five and a half minutes i would repeat this process eight times in a row headaches basically i 'm not the best person to talk to when i 'm doing that stuff he 's six foot four he 's one hundred and sixty pounds and his total lung capacity is twice the so everything that i put into my body i considered i ate really small controlled portions throughout the and by eating so well and training so hard which is lower than most olympic athletes in four months of i was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime time television the world record was eight minutes and guy with the whale lungs i told you about i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and if i stayed there a week not eating i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it and i thought everything the producers of my television special thought that and almost drowning is too boring for television laughter so i had to add handcuffs while holding my breath to escape from this was a critical mistake and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions by seven eight i started to black out they had to pull my body out and bring me back i had failed on every level the only way out of the slump that i could think of was i decided to call oprah i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had this was a different o2 static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at thirteen minutes o2 first oxygenating your body flushing out co2 and you are able to hold much longer i realized that my real so i would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night a hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at fifteen thousand feet so it 's like base camp everest what that does is you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body helps you carry oxygen better every morning again after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out my first attempt on pure o2 i was able to go up to fifteen the neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind at fifteen minutes your brain is done up and i was fine there was one person there that was definitely not impressed it was my while i was breaking the record underwater for the first time she was sifting through my blackberry checking all my messages my brother had a picture of it and what he did in response is he went on regis and kelly and broke his old record then his main competitor went out and broke his record so he suddenly pushed the record up to sixteen minutes and thirty two which was three minutes longer than i had prepared it was longer than the record i did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do i walked into the new york times offices and did card tricks to everybody i don 't know if it was the magic or the lure of the cayman islands but john tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding while he was there i tried to impress him of course and i did a dive down to one hundred and sixty feet which is basically the height of a sixteen story building and as i was coming up i blacked out underwater which is really dangerous i started full focus but in practice i would do it face down floating on the pool but for tv they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face basically the other problem was the the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up so i had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose which was a real problem for me raising the heart rate and it was right next to the sphere every time my heart would which was making me more nervous and there was no way to slow my heart rate down which is pretty i was just sitting there thinking i 've got to slow this down i 'm going to fail and i was getting more nervous and the heart rate just kept going up and up all the way up to one hundred and fifty beats basically it 's the same thing that created my downfall at lincoln center it was a waste of o2 when i made it to the halfway mark at eight minutes i was one hundred percent certain that i was not going to be able to make this there was no way for me to do it i figured oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing if i had cracked early it would be a whole show how depressed i am so i figured i 'm better off just fighting and staying there until i black out at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that and i knew that that was blood shunting when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs and i started to feel i started feeling it was awful at fourteen minutes i had these awful contractions like this urge to breathe and i started having ischemia to the heart it would skip a beat and i was sure that i was going to have a heart attack so at sixteen minutes what i did is i slid my feet out because i knew that if i did go out if i did have a heart attack they 'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up i was really nervous i let my feet out and i started floating to the top and i didn 't take my head out but i was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop and then i realized that i had made it to sixteen thirty two so with the energy of of everybody that was there i decided to keep pushing and i went to seventeen minutes and four seconds i also didn 't want anybody to question it i had the world record and i wanted to and that 's my life so as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible and i think magic whether i 'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards is pretty simple it 's practice it 's training and it 's it 's practice it 's training and experimenting that 's that 's what magic is to me"
