  "transcript": "twelve years ago i picked up a camera for the first time to film the olive harvest in a palestinian village in the west bank but something kept bringing me back they often just want that conflict to go away the israeli palestinian conflict is bad and we wish it could just disappear but every time we turn our attention to the news it seems like one more country has gone up in flames so i 've been wondering whether we should not start looking at conflict in a different way whether instead of simply wishing to end conflict we focus instead this has been a big question for me one i 've pursued together with my team at the nonprofit just vision i started noticing some patterns patterns on the more successful ones i wondered whether these variables held across cases and if they did what lessons we could glean there is some science about this in a study of maria stephan and erica chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns were almost one hundred percent more likely to lead to success than violent campaigns nonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm to those waging the campaign as well as typically lead to more peaceful and democratic societies why don 't more groups use it political scientist victor asal and colleagues have looked at several factors that shape a political group 's choice of tactics and it turns out greatest predictor of a movement 's decision to adopt nonviolence or violence is not whether that group is more left wing or right wing not whether the group is more or less influenced by religious beliefs the greatest predictor of a movement 's decision to adopt nonviolence is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life when a movement includes in its discourse language around gender equality it increases dramatically the chances it will adopt nonviolence and thus the likelihood it will i 've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions such as the one i documented in a village called budrus this village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map when israel started building the separation the proposed route would require the destruction of this community 's olive groves their cemeteries the odds were massively stacked against them but they had secret weapon stopping it and so it was that the women of budrus went to the front lines day after day using their creativity and acumen they win at the end and the women of budrus came to be known across because i do want to tackle two the first one is that i don 't believe women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men but i do believe having had to navigate being in the less powerful position in multiple aspects of their lives women are often more adept at how to surreptitiously pressure for change and finding alternatives to direct confrontation is at the core of nonviolent resistance now to the second potential misunderstanding and some of you might be thinking now that the solution then is for us to educate muslim and arab societies to be more inclusive of their women if we were to do that they would be more successful they do not need this kind of help but they tend to be invisible to the international community our cameras are largely focused on the men who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes that we find so irresistible and we end up with a narrative that not only erases women from the struggles in the region but often and quickly spread to the west bank and east jerusalem it came to be known and people who have any visual memory of it generally conjure up something like this palestinian men throwing rocks at israeli tanks the molotov cocktails this period though was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing in the forms of strikes factions and class lines according to the israeli army itself and here 's another thing that is not part of our narrative about that time for eighteen months in the intifada women were the ones calling the shots behind the scenes palestinian women from all walks of life in charge of mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people in a concerted effort to withdraw consent from the occupation an activity deemed illegal by the israeli authorities at that time who took over decision making authority for the entire uprising when the men who had been running it were deported who ensured the longevity of the uprising by leading an organization that went from twenty five women to three thousand in a single year none of these women have made it into our narrative we do this in other parts of the globe too in our history books for instance and in our collective consciousness men are the public faces and spokespersons mobilizing organizing taking to the streets how many of us think of septima clark but she played a crucial role particularly by emphasizing literacy and ignored like so many other women who played critical roles in the united states civil rights movement this is not about getting credit it 's more profound than that and to how we believe movements are run the stories we tell about a movement like the first intifada or the united states civil rights era matter deeply americans and people around the world will make next time they encounter an injustice and develop the courage to confront it without role models it becomes harder and as we saw earlier one of the most critical variables in determining whether a movement will be successful or not this is a question of whether we 're moving towards more democratic and peaceful societies in a world where so much change is happening and where change is bound to continue at an increasingly faster pace it is not a question of whether we will face but rather a question of which stories will shape how we choose to wage conflict"
