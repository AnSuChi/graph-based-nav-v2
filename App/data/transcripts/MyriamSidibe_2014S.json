  "transcript": "imagine that a plane is about to crash with two hundred and fifty children and babies and if you knew how to stop that would you now imagine that sixty planes full of babies under five and that doesn 't just make me sad it makes me angry diarrhea and pneumonia are among the top two killers of children under five and what we can do to prevent these diseases isn 't some smart new technological innovations it 's one of the world 's oldest inventions a washing hands a habit we all take for granted can reduce diarrhea by half can reduce respiratory infections by one third handwashing with soap can have an impact on reducing flu and most recently in the case of cholera and ebola outbreak one of the key interventions handwashing with soap keeps kids in school it stops babies from dying handwashing with soap is one of the most ways of saving children 's lives it can save over six hundred thousand children every year that 's the equivalent i think you 'll agree with me please shake their hands all so what if i told you that the person whose hands you just shook actually didn 't wash their hands when they were coming out of the toilet statistics are actually showing that four people out of five and soap available it 's the same thing in the countries where child mortality is really high actually soap is available even in countries where soap we are at fifty percent so why is it why aren 't people washing their hands why is it that mayank well soap is used for bathing soap is used for laundry soap is used for washing dishes his parents think sometimes it 's a precious commodity so they 'll keep it in a cupboard they will use soap for washing hands once a day what 's the result of that children pick up disease in the place that 's supposed to love them and protect them the most in their homes however we all and local cultural norms are something that and this is where the private sector comes in every second in asia and africa many women in india will tell you they learned all about hygiene from this bar of soap from lifebuoy brand iconic brands like this one have a responsibility to do good plus the scale of unilever that allows us to keep talking about handwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers big businesses and brands can change and shift those social norms and make a difference for those habits that are so stubborn think about it marketeers and actually they know how to transform science and facts into compelling messages just for a minute imagine when they put all their forces behind a message as handwashing with soap lifebuoy brand was launched in in victorian england i was in ghana because if you don 't know there 's a cholera outbreak in ghana at the moment a hundred and eighteen years the solution is exactly the same it 's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap i think this drive for profit is extremely powerful sometimes more powerful than the most committed charity or government government is doing what they can but with competing priorities the budget is not always there and when you think about this you think about what is required to make handwashing a daily habit it requires sustained funding to refine this behavior in short those we have friends like usaid plan wateraid that all believe for a win for the public sector because we help them reach their win win for the most vulnerable on october fifteen we will celebrate global handwashing day schools communities our friends in the public sector and our friends in the private sector yes on that day even our competitors we all join hands hands to celebrate the world 's most important public health intervention what 's required and again where the private sector can make a huge difference is coming up with this big creative thinking we 've created great great films that bring the message of handwashing with soap to the everyday person in a way that can relate to them we 've had over thirty million views most of these discussions are still happening online i urge you to take five minutes and look at those films i grew up in a family where every dinner conversation was around social justice and the only one with a doctorate in handwashing with soap i decided successful public health career in the making that i could make the biggest impact coming we run today the world 's largest handwashing program we 've reached over one hundred and eighty three million people in sixteen countries my team and i have the ambition to reach one billion by over the last four years business it may be uncomfortable for some to hear business growth and lives saved somehow equated in the same sentence but it is that business growth that allows us to keep doing more without it and without talking about it we cannot achieve the change that we need last week my team and i spent time visiting mothers that have all experienced the same thing i 'm a mom i can 't imagine anything more powerful and more painful this one is from myanmar had the most beautiful smile the smile i think that life gives you when you 've had a second chance her son myo is her second one she had and we know that if we give a bar of soap to every skilled birth attendant and that 's what inspires me inspires me to continue in this mission to know that i can equip her and next time you think of a gift i hope you will join us thank you"
