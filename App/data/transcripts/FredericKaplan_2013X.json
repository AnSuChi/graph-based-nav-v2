  "transcript": "this is an image of the planet earth it looks very much like the apollo pictures you can click on it and if you click on it you can but there 's something missing i 'm not even sure it was taken at in my lab we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time the kind of question we 're asking is is it possible to build something like google maps of the past can i add a slider on top of google maps and just change the year seeing how it was one hundred years before one thousand years before is that possible can i reconstruct social networks of the past can i make a facebook of the middle ages so can i build time machines maybe we can just say no it 's not possible or maybe we can think of it from an information point of view this is what i call the information mushroom vertically you have the time and horizontally the amount of digital information available obviously in the last ten years we have the less information we have if we want to build something like google maps of the past or facebook of the past we need to enlarge this space we need to make that like a rectangle how do we do that i can extract i can extrapolate this is what we call in computer science simulation i can consider it 's not i can consider it 's not just that particular building but probably it also shares the same grammar so if we want to construct a time machine we need two things we need very large archives and we need excellent specialists epfl and the university of venice ca 'foscari there 's something very peculiar about venice that its administration has been very very bureaucratic they 've been keeping you have eighty kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of venice over more than one thousand years you have every boat that goes out every boat that comes in you have every change that was made in the city this is all there we are setting up a 10 year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system the type of objective we want to reach is four hundred and fifty books a day that can be digitized because these documents most of them are in latin in tuscan so you need to transcribe them to translate them in some cases to index them and this is obviously not in particular traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts they do not work so the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain speech recognition this is a domain of something that seems impossible which can actually if you have a very good model of a language which is used we can extract from this document events actually probably ten billion events can be extracted from this archive and this giant information system can be searched in many ways you can ask questions like who lived in this palazzo in how much cost a sea bream at the realto market what was the salary of a glass maker in murano maybe over a decade you can ask even bigger questions because it will be semantically coded and then what you can do is put that in space because much of this information is spatial and from that you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment but of course you cannot understand venice if you just look at the city you have to put it in a larger european context so the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the european level how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time controlling most of the sea routes but you can even do other things you can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system create a mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing which would enable us to have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner if i am in corfu in june and want to go to constantinople ' precision how much will it cost what are the chance of encountering pirates of course you understand the central scientific challenge of a project like there are errors everywhere some of the boats never actually took to sea there are errors and on top of that if you add algorithmic processes you 're going to have errors it 's difficult one thing you can do is document each step of the process not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta historical information documenting each step that will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of venice but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of venice maybe there 's not a single map maybe there are several maps the system should allow for that because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty which is really new for this type again venice is extraordinary for that imagine and vertically you see the document that served the reconstruction paintings for instance some experience you could share within a group on the contrary imagine actually that you start from a document a venetian manuscript and you show actually what you can construct out of it how it is decoded how the context of document can be recreated this is an image from an exhibit which is currently we can say that research in the humanities is about to undergo an evolution which is maybe similar to what happened to life sciences thirty years ago it 's really we see projects which are much beyond any single research team can and this is really new for the humanities which very often take the habit of working so what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of digital humanists that are going to be ready for this shift i thank you very much"
