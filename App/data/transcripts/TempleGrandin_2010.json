  "transcript": "autism is a very big continuum that goes from very severe the child remains nonverbal all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers and i actually feel at home here because there 's a lot of autism genetics here wouldn 't have any it 's a continuum of traits when does a nerd turn into and one of the things that is really going to concern me is getting these kids to be the now the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details and one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstract people are getting away from doing stuff i 'm really concerned that a lot of the schools have taken out the hands on classes this feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility all they needed to do was move the flag rapid contrast shadows would make them balk a hose on the floor people weren 't noticing these things a chain hanging down and that 's shown very very nicely in the movie in fact i loved the movie how they duplicated all my projects that 's the geek side my drawings got to star in the movie my mind works like google for images and i was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different like if i say but it 's going to be true and in the movie they 've got a great scene in there where the word shoe is said and a whole bunch of ' there 's my childhood church that 's specific now visual thinking was a tremendous asset in my work designing and i 've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated at the slaughter plant i 'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides i 've got that stuff up on youtube if you want to look at it but one of the things that i was able to do in my design work is i could just like a virtual reality computer system and there were a lot of kind of asperger types and autism types working out there on the movie set too but one of the things that really worries me is where 's the younger version of those kids going today they 're not ending up in silicon valley where they belong boy in the ' 50s you were taught manners you were taught you can 't pull the merchandise off the shelves in the store and throw it around when kids get to be in third or fourth grade and i used to joke around about having a gigantic internet trunk line going deep into my visual cortex this is tensor age matched control and the control over there the blue one has got a really small one you see the autistic mind tends to now another kind of mind is the pattern thinker more abstract these are your engineers your computer and there in the background is the pattern for folding it here are the types of thinking photo realistic visual thinkers like me you also will see these kind of problems with kids that are others have problems with sound now visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight into the animal mind because think about it an animal is he knows who 's been there it 's all very detailed information and looking at these kind of details puts information into categories man on a horse they 'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian and with the horseshoer but you can 't ride him you have another horse where maybe the horseshoer beat him up and he 'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian but man on a horse a man on foot i find a lot of people are not very good at this when i 'm out troubleshooting equipment or problems with something in a plant they don 't seem to be able to figure out do i have a i find a lot of people have difficulty doing doing that now let 's say i figure out it 's an equipment problem or is the whole design of the system wrong people have a hard time figuring that out and if i was at the faa what would i be doing a lot of direct observation of it would be their airplane tails you know five fatal wrecks in the last twenty years the tail either came off now as i think about that i 'm pulling now here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats he now the thing is the world is going to need all of the different kinds of minds to and nobody 's working on developing their interest in something like science and this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher my science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie and this brings up the whole thing of you 've got to show kids interesting stuff you know one of the things that i think maybe ted ought to do is tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on ted and there 's all kinds of great stuff on the internet to get these or your mind can be wired to be more social and what some of the research now has shown in autism is there may by extra wiring back and then you can get to the point where it 's so severe you 're going to have a person that 's going to be non verbal this is the work of dr bruce miller he studied alzheimer 's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia but i think it 's very interesting that there was some work done to show that this eddy pattern in this painting followed a statistical model brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical because i think that 's going to go on in my autism lectures we 've got to show and they 've taken out the auto shop class and the drafting class and the art class i mean art was my best subject in and let 's talk about jobs i 'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven 't learned basic things like how to be on time i was taught that when i was eight years old how to have table manners at granny 's sunday party and when i was thirteen i had a job at a dressmaker 's shop sewing clothes i did internships in college you know all i wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when i let 's get him working on building different things the thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated use that fixation in order to motivate that kid that 's one of the things we need to do i really get fed up when the teachers especially when you get away from this part of the country they don 't know what to do with these smart kids it just drives me crazy what can visual thinkers do when they grow up they can do graphic design all kinds of stuff with computers photography industrial design the pattern thinkers they 're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians your software engineers your computer programmers and we need to be working with these students and this brings up my science teacher was not an accredited teacher he was a nasa space scientist some states now are getting it to where if you have a degree in biology or in chemistry you can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools another thing that can be very very very successful is there 's a lot of people that may have retired because what you 're doing is you 're lighting the spark you 're getting that kid turned on and you get him turned on then you 'll learn all the new stuff and we 've got to mentor them hire them and if you bring them in for internships in your companies the thing about the autism asperger y kind of mind you 've got to give them a specific task don 't just say design new software you 've got to tell them something more specific we 're designing software for a phone and it has to do some specific thing and it can only use so much memory that 's the kind of specificity you need well that 's and i just want to thank everybody for from the face of the earth then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire at the entrance to a cave temple grandin and the energy crisis would not be but if there is someone here who has an autistic child or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them what advice would you give them tg well first of all degrees about half of the people on the spectrum are not going to learn to talk and they won 't be working in silicon valley and that 's where you 've got to get them turned on with doing interesting things i got social interaction through shared interests i rode horses with onto a rubber membrane on a speaker to make a light show that was like we considered that super cool ca is it unrealistic for them to hope or think that that child loves them as some might as most wish tg well i tell you that child will be loyal and if your house is burning down they 're going to get you out of it ca passionate about that the things i do are going to make the world a better place when i have a mother of an autistic child say my kid went to college because of your book or one of your lectures that makes me happy you know the slaughter plants i worked with in the ' 80s they were absolutely awful i developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes how many cattle fell down how many got poked with the prodder how many cattle are mooing their heads off i get satisfaction out of seeing stuff that makes real change in the real world we need a lot more of that and a lot less abstract stuff one of the things you said that really astonished me was that one thing you were passionate about was server farms tell me about that tg it it 's libraries and to me knowledge is something that is extremely valuable so maybe ten years ago now our library got flooded this is before the internet got really big and i was really upset about all the books being wrecked and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge ca temple can i just say it 's an absolute delight to have you at ted"
