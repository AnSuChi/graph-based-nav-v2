  "transcript": "so bear with me as i take you through this journey when i was twenty two years old i came home from work i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever while i was preparing my dog for the run picked up his car keys got into a car and headed south or wherever he was i was running across the street and the only thing that i and i remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life 's blood emptying out of my neck she ended up underneath the car i flew out in front of the car and then he ran over my legs my left leg got caught up in the wheel well spun it around the bumper of the car hit my throat slicing it open i ended up with blunt chest trauma your aorta comes up behind your heart it 's your major artery and it was severed so my my blood was gurgling out of my mouth it foamed and horrible things were happening to me i say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it somebody was smart and put a bic pen in my neck to open up my airway so i could get some air in there and my lung collapsed so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well to to stop that catastrophic event from happening eighteen months later i woke up i was blind i couldn 't speak and i the hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that and in fact they started to call me a gomer that 's another story we won 't even get into i had so many surgeries to put my neck back together to repair my heart a few times some things worked some things didn 't i had lots of titanium put in me cadaver bones to try to but but who 's counting so eventually the hospital decided it was time for me to go they needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could could come back from whatever all of you are scratching your head a senior citizens ' home what in the world are you going to do there but if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now so there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had the one advantage they had over most of you is wisdom but imagine what it was like for them when i showed up at their doorstep i was wearing hospital scrubs and somebody donated tennis shoes for me and i had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting what skills do we have in this room this kid needs a lot of work so they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs but one of the first things they needed to do was assess what i needed right away i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being since i 'd been eating through a tube in my chest and and through my veins so i had to go through she needs furniture she is sleeping in the corner of this apartment they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture gave me pots and pans blankets and then then the next thing that i needed was a makeover so out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints we not going to talk about the hairstyles they tried to force on me once my hair grew back but i did say no to the blue hair what went on is so they figured not being able to see is one but they need to get me to talk so while sally the office manager was teaching me to speak in the day it 's hard because when you 're a kid you take things for granted you learn things unconsciously but for me i was an adult and it was embarrassing and i had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue and my new teeth and my lips and capture the air and get the word out so i acted like a so they were teaching me cuss word scrabble at night laughter and then secretly how to swear like a sailor laughter i 'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were when sally finally got my confidence built so i moved on from there and a former teacher who happened to have alzheimer 's took on the task of teaching me to write the redundancy was actually good for me one of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross the street again so close your eyes now imagine you have to cross a street you don 't know how far that street is and you don 't know if you 're going straight so there were two obstacles i had to get through one was post traumatic stress disorder every time i approached the the corner or the curb i would panic and the second one was so one of the seniors just came up to me and she pushed me up to the corner and said when you think it 's time to go just stick the cane out there if it 's hit don 't cross the street laughter made perfect sense but by the third cane that went whizzing across the road so that i could go to the braille institute and actually gain the skills to be and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained ten years later i gained my sight back not magically the biggest change for me was that the world moved forward that there were innovations and all kinds of new things cellphones and is replaced with how you feel about things and so one day i was in my room and i saw this thing sitting in my room i thought it was a monster so i was walking around it and i go i 'm just going to touch it and i touched it and i went everything is different because you take that for granted but when you 're blind you have the tactile memory for things the biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that i 'd lost ten years of my life i thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends but when i looked down i realized that time marched on for me too and that i needed to get caught up so i got got going on it i wouldn 't be standing here today if it wasn 't for extreme radical collaboration thank you so much"
