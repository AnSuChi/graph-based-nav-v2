  "transcript": "my name 's seth priebatsch i 'm the chief ninja of scvngr i 'm a proud princeton dropout also proud to have relocated here to boston where i actually grew up easy wins i should just name the counties that we 've i 'm also fairly determined to try and build a game layer on top of the world this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built where the motivations we use to actually influence behavior and the framework in which that is constructed i say i want to build a game layer on top of the world but that 's not quite true because it 's already under construction it 's already happening there are credit card schemes and airline mile programs coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes that actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer they just suck but luckily as my favorite action hero bob the builder says and so the crux of this presentation is going to go through four really important game dynamics really interesting things that if you use consciously you can but this is the the important stage in which that framework will get built and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now and it 's very important and construction on that layer is over and it 's called facebook and that 's a lot of people are very happy with facebook i like it quite a lot they 've created this thing called the open graph and they own all of our connections they own half a billion people so when you want to build on the social layer the framework has been decided it is there 's nothing you can do and that 's a real thing i mean we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it productive down the road the game layer is all about influence it 's not about adding a social fabric to the web and connecting you to other people everywhere you are and everywhere you go it 's actually about using dynamics using forces to influence the behavior of where you are what you do there how you do it that 's really really powerful and it 's going to be more important than the social layer and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly while the frameworks like facebook or open graph are being created for the game layer equivalent that we think about it so that 's what i want to talk about for game dynamics because construction has just begun and the more consciously we can think about this the better we 'll be able to use it for anything we want like i said the way you go through and build on the game layer is not with and the tools the raw materials are these game dynamics with that a couple game dynamics to talk about back at scvngr we like to joke that with seven game dynamics you can get anyone to do anything today i 'm going to show you four because i hope to have a advantage at the end of this still laughter so the first one it 's a very simple game dynamic it 's called the appointment dynamic it 's a dynamic in which to succeed players have to do something at a predefined time generally at a predefined place and these dynamics are a little scary sometimes because you think other people can be using forces that will manipulate how i interact what i do where i do it when i do it so with each dynamic i 'm going to give three examples one that shows how it 's already being used in the real world so you can rationalize it a bit one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game i think everything is a game but this is more so you can see that so the first one the most famous appointment dynamic in the world is something called happy hour so i had just recently dropped out of princeton and actually ended up come here at a certain time get your drinks half off to win all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time this game dynamic is so powerful it doesn 't just influence our behavior it 's influenced our entire culture it also exists in more conventional game forms i 'm sure you 've all heard of farmville by now if you haven 't i recommend playing it you won 't do anything else for the rest of your day it 's incredibly powerful and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time to water your fake it changes the life cycle they could make it a 30 minute cycle and no one could do anything else right that 's a little scary this local company called vitality has created a product to help people take their medicine on time it 's something that people don 't do very well they have these glowcaps which flash and email you and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine and leverage the games then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways we 're going to jump onto the next one influence and status this is one of the most most famous game dynamics used all over the place we all want that credit card on the far left because it 's black and you see someone at cvs or not cvs like christian dior i don 't know i don 't have a black card i 've got a debit card whip it out and you see that black card and i want that because it means they 're cooler than i am and i need that and that means that i am somehow better it 's also used in more and can be used more consciously there school and remember i made it through one year so i think i 'm qualified to talk on school if we called valedictorian a white knight paladin level twenty i think people would probably work a lot harder but let 's use it consciously why have games you can lose why go from an a to an f or a b to a c that why not level up at princeton they 've actually experimented experimented with this with quizzes where you gain experience points and you level up from b to an and it 's very powerful it can be used in interesting ways this is used all over the place including linkedin where and this is this is so deep seated in our psyche that when we 're presented with a progress bar and presented with easy granular steps to take to we will do it we will find a way to move that blue line all the way to the right edge of the screen this is used in conventional games as well i mean this is a paladin level ten and that 's a paladin level twenty and if you were going to fight orcs on the fields of mordor against the ra 's al ghul you 'd probably want to be the the bigger one right i would and so people work very hard to of warcraft is one of the most successful games of all time it 's insane and they have these systems where you can level up and that 's a very powerful thing progression is powerful it can also be used in very compelling ways for good one of the things we work and here we have a game that people play they go places do challenges earn points and we 've introduced a progression dynamic into it where by going to the same place over and over doing challenges engaging with the business you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right and unlock rewards creates loyalty creates engagement the final one i want to talk about and it 's a great one to end on is this concept of communal discovery a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems is used in some famous consumer web stories like digg which i 'm sure you 've all heard of initially they had a leader board where if you recommended the best stories you would get points but it became so powerful there was actually a cabal a group of people the top seven the game became more powerful than the goal they ended up shutting down the leader board and started having people work to maintain leadership so we have to use this one carefully there they 're just looking for a sticker that says boardwalk but it can also be used to find real things this is the darpa balloon challenge where they hid a couple balloons all across the united states and said use networks try and find these balloons fastest and the winner will get $ forty thousand the winner was a group out of mit where they created sort of a pyramid scheme a network where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $ two thousand and anyone else they were able to find all these balloons all across the country so if i 'm going to leave you with anything it 's very powerful it 's very exciting let 's all build it together let 's do it well and have fun playing"
