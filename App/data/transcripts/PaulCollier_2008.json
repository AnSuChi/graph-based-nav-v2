  "transcript": "well the thesis of the bottom billion is that a billion people have been stuck living and hence diverging from the rest of mankind and so the real question to pose is not can we be optimistic it 's how can we give credible hope to that billion people what i 'm going to offer you which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened compassion because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope enlightened because if that economic divergence continues for another forty it will build a nightmare for our children we need compassion to get ourselves started and enlightened that 's the alliance that changes the world well a good guide is to think what did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world that gives us it turns out quite a good clue except you have to go back quite a long time the last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late and the region that needed to be developed was my though there was that it was that you knew you had to because in the late so what did you do that was marshall aid we need to do it again but what else did you do and totally reversed and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the general agreement on tariffs and trade so total reversal of trade policy before the war your security policy had you tear up the eleventh commandment you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct you found the imf you encouraged europe to create the european community all systems for mutual government support that is still the waterfront of effective policies aid trade security governments it 's so that they actually catch up is that easier or harder we need to be at least as now today i 'm going to take just one of those four i 'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest the one that 's just motherhood and apple pie governments mutual systems of support for governments and i 'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance the opportunity we 're going to look to is and that is the commodity booms the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money but it 's not just that there 's also uganda has just discovered oil in about the most disastrous location on earth between them these new revenue flows dwarf aid just to give you one example angola alone is getting fifty billion dollars a year in oil revenue aid flows to the sixty countries of the bottom billion last year were thirty four billion so the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent so there 's the optimism the question is how is it going to help their development it 's a huge opportunity for transformational development here comes a bit of science and this is a bit of science i 've done since the bottom billion so it 's new i 've looked to see what is the relationship between and the growth of commodity exporting countries and looked to see what the relationship say the first five to seven years everything goes up you get more money because your terms of trade have improved but also that drives up output across the board so gdp goes up a lot that 's the short run it 's humpty dumpty but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they 'd had no booms at all that is not a forecast about how commodity it 's a forecast of the consequences the long term consequences for growth of an increase in prices so what goes wrong why is there this resource curse as it 's called the initial level of economic governance resource booms accrue it 's australia it 's canada the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a the best growth rates they 've had ever and the question is whether the short run will persist and with bad governance historically over the last forty years it hasn 't it 's countries like nigeria which are worse off than if they 'd never had oil there 's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term and below which you go down just to benchmark that threshold it 's about the governance level of portugal in the mid 1980s so the question is are the bottom billion above or below that threshold now there 's one big change since the commodity booms of so i thought well maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy so i looked democracy does have significant effects democracies make even more two distinct aspects of democracy and there are checks and balances which determine how you use power whereas strong checks and balances they got instant democracy in the elections without checks and balances how can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances there are intense struggles to do just that but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues we know these international standards work because we 've already got one it 's called the extractive industries transparency initiative that is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have no sooner was it proposed than reformers in nigeria adopted it nigerian newspapers circulations spiked people wanted to know so we know it works what would the content be but i 'll give you the first is how to take the resources out of the ground the economic processes taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction you know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment how they 've been sold over the last forty years and it 's quite often great for the minister the and the british treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth it 'll reveal the value if the british treasury can be out by a factor of ten think what the ministry of finance in sierra leone is going to be like if we could do it we would change the world we would be helping the reformers in these societies who are for change that 's our modest role the cost of promulgating international rules why on earth are they not there i realized that the reason they 're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies politicians will get away with gestures that unless we have an informed society but don 't work and so i realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry"
