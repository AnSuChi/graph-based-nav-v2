  "transcript": "at the age of four because of the coup d 'tat my family had to leave they too had a military coup i vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night and gathering the few belongings we could and walking for about two hours to a safe house for a week we slept under our beds we moved to botswana this time it was different everything worked great education they had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had the only thing they didn 't have is that they didn 't have their own national television station and so i remember watching tv from neighboring south africa and watching nelson mandela in jail being offered a chance to come out but he didn 't he refused to do that until he actually achieved his objective of freeing south africa from apartheid and i remember feeling how just one good leader then at the age of twelve and everything was and it seemed all of a sudden that thirty years of development had been wiped out how could a country go so bad so fast most people would agree that it 's all because of leadership now all these experiences of living in different parts of africa growing up everywhere i went i experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent and saw the and the spirit of our people and at the time i realized that i wanted to dedicate the rest of my life you see all these countries i lived in the coups d 'tat and the corruption i 'd seen in ghana and gambia contrasted with the wonderful examples i had seen in botswana and in south africa it is this the difference that just one good leader can make is much greater than anywhere else and here 's why it civil society so here 's a general rule of thumb that i believe in but when you have weak then just one good leader let me make it a bit more concrete i 've arrived i 'm the most powerful man in the world so you decide perhaps let me pass a law let me try this way the senate comes and says uh uh we don 't think you can do that i think the economy needs a stimulus i think i 'd like to stay in it forever well you just can you decide you want to print money you call the central bank governor and you say please double the money supply he 'll say okay yes sir is there anything else i can do for you this is the power that african leaders have and this is why they make the most difference on the continent the good news we 've had three generations of leaders in my mind generation one the legacy they left is that they brought independence to they freed us from colonialism and let 's give them credit for that they were followed by generation two corruption human rights abuses and they were replaced by generation three these are people like the late nelson mandela and most of the leaders that we see in africa today and i call them the stabilizer generation they 're much more accountable to their people they 've improved macroeconomic but they are by and large the best leaders we 've seen in the last fifty years i believe that the next generation to come after this generation four has a unique opportunity to transform the continent the first thing they need to do why is prosperity so important because none of the previous generations have been able to tackle this issue of poverty but also is the poorest and by two thousand and fifty it will have the largest workforce in the world so if we don 't grow our economies fast enough let me show you an example laetitia 's a young woman from kenya who at the age of thirteen had to drop out of school because her family couldn 't afford to pay fees for her so she started her own business rearing rabbits which happen to be a delicacy in this part of kenya that she 's from this business did so well that within a year she was employing fifteen women and today she educates four hundred children in her community and she 's just turned eighteen another example is erick rajaonary erick comes from the island of madagascar now erick realized that agriculture would be the key to creating jobs in the rural areas of madagascar but he also realized that fertilizer was a very expensive input for most farmers in madagascar madagascar has these very special bats that produce these droppings that are very high in nutrients in two thousand and six erick quit his job as a chartered accountant and started a company to manufacture fertilizer from the bat droppings and he employs seventy people full time and another eight hundred people during the season when the bats drop their droppings the most now what i like about this story is that erick is known as the batman and who would have thought that you would have been able to build a employing so many people just from bat poo the second thing that this generation needs to do they need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again now all of this sounds great but where are we going to get this generation four from i believe that we need to create african institutions laetitia is one of our young leaders but one thing has been troubling me we would get about four thousand applications a year for one hundred young leaders that we could take into this academy but we couldn 't satisfy it i 'm announcing for the first time in public we 're building twenty five brand new universities in africa that are going to cultivate this next generation of african leaders each campus will have ten thousand leaders at a time so we 'll be educating and developing two hundred and fifty thousand leaders at any given time my hope is that half of them will become the entrepreneurs that we need who will create these jobs that we need and the other half will go into government but instead of getting admitted because of scores or because of how much money you have or which family you come from the main criteria for getting into this university will be what is the potential that you have for transforming africa we cannot transform africa by ourselves my hope is that many many other and these institutions will all come together with a common vision of developing this next generation of african leaders generation four nelson mandela once said every now and then a generation is called upon to be great you can be that great generation i believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate then this generation four that is coming up thank you"
