  "transcript": "i 'm going to talk about a technology that we 're developing at oxford now that we think is going to change the way that computer games and hollywood movies are being made that technology is simulating humans it 's simulated humans with a simulated body now before i talk more about that technology let 's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games and what you can see is it is actually a very good game it 's one of the most successful games of time but what you 'll see is that all the animations in this game the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters they are a graphical visualization of a character to produce these animations an animator at a studio has to anticipate what 's going to happen and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times the result of that is that you can 't have real interactivity all you have is animations that are played back at more or less it also means that games most of the animations the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body and maybe if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is because if i push chris a bit like this for example he 'll react to it if i push him from a different angle he 'll react to it differently and that 's because he has a physical body and because he has the motor skills to control that body it 's a very trivial thing it 's not something you get in computer games at the moment at all thank you very much chris anderson that 's it torsten reil that 's it yes so that 's what we 're trying to simulate not chris specifically i should say but humans in general we started working on this a while ago at oxford university and we tried to start very simply what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk that stick figure is physically stimulated you can see it here on the screen so if you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work and for that we use the neural network which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk for that we used artificial evolution genetic algorithms we heard about those already yesterday and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already but just briefly the concept is is that you create you hook these up in this case to the virtual muscles creature here and hope that it does something interesting at the beginning they 're all going to be very boring most of them won 't move at all but some of them might make a tiny step those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and and you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walks in this case in a straight line like this so that was the idea behind this when we started this i set up the simulation one evening it took about three to hours to run the simulation i got up the next morning went to the computer and this is what i got instead we did get it to work eventually and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run so what you 'll see in a moment is so this is the one that can 't walk at all now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better take a few steps more but now after generation twenty it actually walks in a straight line without falling over it was academically quite a challenging project and once we had reached that stage we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with with this approach actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it it will fall over it in and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it 'll again fall differently now what you see by the way at the top there are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles okay that 's the video thanks now this might look kind of trivial but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds what we really wanted was a full human body so we started the company we hired a team of physicists software engineers and biologists to work on this and the first thing we had to work on was to create so we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing is a very simple visualization of that body i should add that it 's very simple to add things like hair clothes etc but what we 've done here is use a very simple simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement now what i 'm going to do right now in a moment is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it so this character now has motor skills in the upper body it gets really interesting if you then add the ai for the lower part of the body as well so here we 've got the same character i 'm going to push it a bit harder but what you 'll see is it 's going to receive a push now from from the left it tries to counter balance it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land now this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions again just as i 've done that 's something that you cannot do right now at the moment you only have empty computer graphics in in games so here 's the same character with the same behavior i 've just shown you but now i 'm just going to push it from different directions first starting with a push from the right the angle will have changed a tiny bit so you can see that the reaction is different again a push now this time from and now from the left and it falls differently that was really exciting for us to see that that was the first time we 've seen that this is the first time the public sees this as well because we have been in stealth mode i haven 't shown this to anybody yet just a fun thing what happens if you put that character this is now a wooden version of it but it 's got the same ai in it if you put that character we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens and this is what happens it 's nothing we had to do about this we just took this character that i just talked about put it on a slippery surface and this is what you get out of it and that 's a really fascinating thing about this approach now when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology and what they said was the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen because stunts are obviously very dangerous they 're very expensive and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do obviously because you can 't really and that 's our first product that we 're going to release in a couple of weeks that 's what people want that 's what we 're giving them you can see it 's always reacting this is not a dead body this is a body who basically in this particular case feels the force and tries to protect its head kind of sorry for that thing and we 've seen it so many times now that we don 't really care any more there are much worse videos than this by the way which i have taken out but a strong force applied to the character and have the character react to it so this character is going to be hit by a force it 's going to realize it 's in the air and it 's going to try and stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing that we now think that the realism we 're achieving with this is good enough this is something i just got last night from an animation studio in london who are using our software and so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw but in a slightly so if you look at the character carefully you see there are lots of body movements going on none of which you have to animate like in the old at the moment doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days this is another behavior they requested i 'm not quite sure why but we 've done it anyway it 's a very simple and it looks organic it looks realistic you feel kind of sorry for the guy it 's even worse and that is another video i just got last night if you render that a bit more realistically one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is just about see it here in this case they were using a real stunt man it was a very dangerous stunt it was just voted i think in the sunday times as one of the most impressive stunts now we 've just tried and looked at our character and asked ourselves can we do that ourselves as well can we use the physical simulation of the character use artificial and then skydive afterwards and have him caught by a bungee we did that it took about altogether just two hours pretty much to create the simulation and that 's what it looks like here this could do with a bit more work it 's still very early stages and we pretty much just did this for a laugh just to see what we 'd get out of it but what we found that we 're pretty much standard upon is is incredibly powerful we are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of there 's so many things we several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen and they 're going to hit the screen the second thing is video games with this technology video games will look different and they will feel very different for the first time you 'll have actors that really feel very interactive that have real bodies that really react probably starting with sports games which are going to become much more interactive the degree of interactivity you 're going to get is totally different i think from what you 're getting right now a third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation we 've been approached by several simulation companies but one project we 're particularly excited about which we 're starting next month is to use our technology and in particular the walking technology to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy it 's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait now what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool that 's one project we 're particularly excited about and that 's going to start next month this is only just the beginning we can only do several behaviors right now the ai isn 't good enough to simulate a full human body the body yes but not all the motor skills that we have and i think we 're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing right now we don 't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage we do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing i 'm going to show you this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved but this is what emerged out of it in the end that 's just the simulation creating this itself basically not quite john travolta yet but we 're working on that as well so thanks very much for"
