  "transcript": "i 'm here today i want to define what i mean we need a revolution because things aren 't working they and that makes me really sad because i 'm sick and tired of things not working you know i 'm sick and tired of us not living up to our potential i 'm sick and tired of us being last and we are last place in so many things for example we 're last place in europe in innovation there we are right at the end right at the bottom last place as a culture that doesn 't value innovation we 're last place in health care and that 's important for a sense of and worst of all it relative to gdp per capita the saddest place on earth that 's social let 's look at education where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd last in reading math and science lowest perception in the e u that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society guess what last in europe gdp per capita last we 're unhappy we have bad education and we have the worst businesses and these are facts guys this isn 't story tale it 's not make believe it 's not it 's not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria the way we think the way we behave our operating system of behaving is broken we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform bulgaria for the better for ourselves for our friends for our family and for our future how did this happen let kids play adults play we don 't value play in fact we devalue play and we devalue it in three areas let 's go back to the same three areas social self expression and innovation and instead what do we value because it 's shown the way we apply generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context which told us what in communism to i can 't tell you how many times i 've been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground water that will kill them i have been told by babas and dyados that we shouldn 't let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life we have a serious meme running through it 's a social gene running through us it 's a serious gene it 's forty five years of it that 's created what i call the baba factor and here 's how it works step one woman says i want to have a baby iskam baby step two we get the baby but we need to remember that baba 's been infected by the serious meme for for forty five years so what happens she passes that virus on to baby and it takes a really really really long time as the redwood trees that serious meme to get out of our operating system that values rote learning memorization and standardization and devalues questioning creativity we went to this prestigious little school and they say and we said well what about play and recess there won 't be a single moment in the schedule and we said he 's five what a crime what a crime and it 's a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we 're creating mindless robotic workers to put bolts in pre drilled holes but i 'm sorry we need adaptability the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative we don 't qualities of a bulgarian work autocratic do what i say because i 'm the chef i 'm the boss and i know better than you untrusting you 're obviously a criminal so i 'm going to install cameras controlling you 're obviously an idiot so i 'm going to make a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don 't step out of the box so they 're restrictive don 't use your mobile phone don 't use your laptop don 't search the internet don 't be on i m that 's somehow unprofessional and bad and at the end of the day it 's unfulfilling because you 're controlled you 're restricted you 're not valued and you 're not having any fun in social in education and in our business don 't value play and that 's why we 're last because we don 't value play what a dumb idea it can 't be because of play well i 'm going to say no and i will prove it to you in the next part of the speech that play is the catalyst it is the revolution that we can use to transform bulgaria for the better our brains evolution has selected over millions and billions of years for evolution does a really really good job of deselecting traits that aren 't advantageous to us ants play but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better skills but what you may not know is that kittens deprived of play are unable to interact socially they can still but they can 't be social it 's not the bears that learn how to fish better it 's the ones that play more and a final really interesting study the more you play the bigger the brains there are dolphins pretty big brains play a but who do you think yours truly humans and it 's not just kids it 's adults too really cool term neoteny the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults and who are the we 're designed to do that it a huge benefit just like there 's benefits to animals there 's benefits to humans it 's been shown to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala in the area where it controls emotions it 's been shown to promote pre frontal cortex development where a lot of cognition is happening we develop better decision making ability if we the benefits to play it is a genetic we hold ourselves back little exercise just for a second close your eyes and imagine a world without theater without the arts without song without dancing what does this world look like it or maybe the workplace of your friends here we we have this concept that the opposite we even feel guilty if we 're seen playing at work oh my colleagues see me laughing i must not have enough work or oh i 've got to hide because my boss might see me 's going to think i 'm not working hard it 's depression in fact play improves our work just like there 's benefits for humans and animals there 's benefits for play at work for example it stimulates creativity it increases our openness to change through play so before you start thinking of play as just not serious play doesn 't mean frivolous you know the professional athlete that loves skiing he 's serious about it but he loves it he 's having fun 's in the groove he 's in the flow a doctor might be serious but laughter 's still a great medicine quick example from the corporate world fedex easy motto people service profit if you treat your people sense of mastery and purpose what happens they give better service not worse but better and when customers call for service and they 're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled how do the customers feel they feel great and what do great customers do great feeling customers they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends which leads to more profit people service profit play increases productivity not decreases and you 're going to say no way we 're different besides the serious meme that we have to kick out two i 've tried it i 've tried at sciant when i got there we had zero happy customers not one customer would refer us i asked them all we had marginal profits and we had unhappy stakeholders through some basic change change like improving transparency self direction and collaboration encouraging collaboration not autocracy i don 't care when you leave i care that your customer and your team is happy through promoting fun and a great environment we were able to transform sciant and in just three short years sounds like a long time but change is slow every customer from zero to every customer referring us above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders independent analysis and it can work in bulgaria there 's nothing holding us back except our own mentality about play so some steps that we can take to finish up first of have to believe me if you don 't believe me well just go home and think about it some more or something second of all if you don 't have the feeling of play in you you need to rediscover play whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy that you enjoyed only six months ago but now that you 've because you feel like you have to be serious rediscover it i don 't to the office or talk to your friends and ignite the fire of change in the play revolution you guys have to and if you 're not feeling it your colleagues your employees aren 't going to feel it you 've got to go back and say hey i 'm going to trust you weird concept i hired you i should trust you i 'm going to let you make decisions i 'm going to empower you and i 'm going to delegate the lowest level rather than the top i 'm going to encourage constructive criticism i 'm going to let you challenge authority because it 's by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we 're in and create innovative solutions to problems of today we 're going to eradicate fear fear is the enemy of play and we 're going to do things eliminate restrictions you know what let them use their mobile phone for personal calls let them take long lunches you have a beer you have some food you talk let them do it so that twenty years from now we wake up and say is this it is that all there was unacceptable nepriemliv but we don 't need what we need what we need is a players ' uprising seriously we need to band together today is the start of the uprising but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about how play promotes a sense of promise and self fulfillment of how play promotes innovation and productivity and how play creates meaning we can transform bulgaria for the better"
