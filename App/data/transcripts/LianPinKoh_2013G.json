  "transcript": "we tend to think of the snow capped mountains of the himalayas the crystal clear still waters of its alpine lakes or the huge expanse of its grasslands what some of us may not realize is that in the himalayan foothills but unfortunately these animals are under constant threat from poachers who hunt and kill them for their body but that is not an easy task because these soldiers have to patrol thousands of hectares of forests on foot or elephant backs it is also risky for these soldiers when they get into gunfights with poachers and therefore nepal is always looking for new ways to help with protecting the forests and wildlife and these are drones or more specifically conservation drones for about a year now my colleagues and i have been building drones for nepal and training the park protection personnel on the use of these drones but it also allows you to capture detailed images of objects on the ground this for example is a pair of rhinoceros taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day in the lowlands of nepal now we believe that drones have tremendous potential not only for combating so what is a drone and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer a gps a compass a barometric altimeter and a few other sensors now a drone like this is meant to carry a useful payload such as a video camera or a photographic camera it also requires a software that allows the user to program a mission to tell the drone where to go but they are even more surprised when i tell them how affordable these components are the facts is a conservation drone doesn 't cost very much more than a good laptop computer or a decent pair of binoculars so now that you 've built your own conservation drone you probably want to go fly it but how does one fly a drone well all you have to do is to program a mission to tell the drone where to fly but you simply do that by clicking on a few way points on the google maps interface using the open source software we fly the drone in a lawnmower type pattern and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest now whatever your mission is and launch it simply by tossing it in the air and often we 'll go about this mission taking pictures so what can we do with a conservation drone well when we built our first prototype drone our main objective was to fly it over a remote rainforest in north sumatra indonesia to look for the nest of a species of great ape known as the orangutan the reason we wanted to do that was because we needed to know how many individuals of now the traditional method of surveying for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot carrying heavy equipment and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops now as you can imagine that is a very and costly process so we were hoping that drones could significantly reduce the cost of surveying for orangutan so we were very excited when we since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from this is a wild orangutan seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying not once but several times and even turtle nests sometimes so we wanted to use this and this map gives us crucial crucial information for monitoring land use change to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding where forests might be contracting or where fires might be breaking out aerial images could also be processed to produce but they are also geometrically accurate which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night since then we 've been building drones for our collaborators from around the world and these include fellow biologists and partners from major conservation organizations building drones for us is a constant work in progress we are constantly trying to improve them in terms of their range their ruggedness we also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones for example camera traps are a common tool used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals hiding in the forests motion activated cameras so they snap a but the problem with camera traps is that the researcher has to go back to the forest every so often to retrieve those images and that takes a lot but the traditional way of tracking animals is pretty ridiculous because it requires the researcher to be walking on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna not unlike those old tv antennae we used to have on our rooftops some of us still do why not equip a drone with a scanning radio fly that over the forest canopy in a certain pattern which would allow the user or the operator to triangulate the location of these radio collared animals remotely without having to step foot in the forest a third and perhaps most exciting way of using these drones is to fly them to a really remote rainforest somewhere hidden in the tropics and parachute down a tiny spy microphone whatever that would give us biologists a pretty good idea of what animals might be living in those forests and finally i would like to show you the latest version of our conservation drone the maja drone has a wingspan of about two meters during its mission it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time it carries a variety of and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel now conservation drones began as a crazy idea from two biologists who are just deeply passionate we believe strongly believe that drones we 've had our fair share of skeptics and critics who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes i mean let 's be honest drones are the ultimate toys for boys but we 've also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision see the potential of conservation drones to us it is obvious that conservation biologists and practitioners should make full use of every available tool including drones in our fight to save the last remaining forests and wildlife of this planet"
