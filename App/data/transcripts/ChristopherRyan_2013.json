  "transcript": "yeah all right so what i 'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you 've ever heard a couple having sex i see one guy there it doesn 't count if it was you sir now what does this tell us it tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex and it 's generally the woman who makes more noise this is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd i wasn 't even going to mention this but somebody told me that meg ryan might be here and she is the world 's most famous female so i thought got to talk about that we 'll get back to that a little despite what you may have heard we are apes we are more closely related to the chimp and the bonobo than the african elephant is to the indian elephant as jared diamond pointed out in one of his early books we 're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate so we 're extremely closely related to them so what i 'm asking today the question i want to explore with you today is what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality now since darwin 's day there 's been what cacilda and i have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution read this stuff the idea is that as part of human nature from the beginning of our species ' time men have sort of leased women 's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services generally now this sets men and women the war between the sexes is built right into our dna according to this vision right what cacilda and i have argued is that no this economic which only arose about ten thousand years ago at the earliest anatomically modern human beings so before agriculture before the agricultural revolution it 's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they 're found in the world what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism shelter protection all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity it turns out are shared widely among these societies now i 'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages and i 'm not saying modern day savages either what i 'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context and there 's really no argument about this among anthropologists so we 've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex flexible social systems networks that our ancestors were very good at and that 's why our species has survived so well listen i 'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous but i 'm not saying they were having sex with strangers there were no strangers in a hunter gatherer band there are no strangers you 've known these people your entire life so i 'm saying yes there were overlapping sexual relationships that our ancestors probably had several but i 'm not saying they were having sex with strangers i 'm not saying that they didn 't love the people they were and those of us who have chosen to be monogamous my parents for example have been married for fifty two years monogamously and if it wasn 't monogamously mom and dad i don 't want to hear about it i 'm not criticizing this and i 'm not saying there 's anything wrong with this what i 'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism so this is my point that one took a minute to sink in now in addition to being a great genius a wonderful man a wonderful husband a wonderful father charles darwin was also a world class victorian prude so he couldn 't understand why on earth would the female have developed chimps and bonobos darwin didn 't really know this but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings interestingly chimps have sexual swellings through forty whether she 's menstruating whether she 's post menopausal whether she 's already pregnant this is vanishingly rare so it 's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality now darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day as scientists tend to do sometimes the question is whether these sperm are competing against other men 's sperm or just their own there 's a lot to talk about in this chart the one thing i 'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the female chimp and bonobo and human that indicates female copulatory vocalization just look at the numbers the average human has sex about one thousand times per birth if that number seems high for some of you i assure you it seems low for others in the room we don 't share it with the other three apes the gorilla the orangutan and the gibbon humans and bonobos are the only animals that have sex face to face when both of them are alive and you 'll see that the human chimp and bonobo all have external which in our book we we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer if you 're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage you expect a party to happen at any moment and you need to be ready that 's what the external testicles are they keep the sperm cells cool historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed about human sexual evolution these women are the mosuo from southwestern china in their society men and women are completely sexually autonomous there 's no shame associated with sexual behavior women have hundreds of partners it doesn 't matter nobody cares nobody gossips it 's not an issue when the woman becomes pregnant the child is cared for by her her sisters and her brothers the biological father is a nonissue these people actually believe so a woman who wants to have a child who 's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy the funny guy and the strong guy to get the essence of each of these men into the baby and then when the child is born so there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book edward wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation think that 's true this matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world the contradictions between what we 're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering my hope is that a more updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves for each other and that we 'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate instinctive right to monitor and control women 's sexual 'll see that it 's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet we all have closets we have to come out of and when we do come out of those closets we 'll recognize that our fight is not with each other our fight is with an outdated victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy thank you trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today someone and if you look at lots of societies around the world you 'll see very high rates of violence nonviolence but it 's not who you are how is that different from the talk you gave cr well first of all the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable but that 's just an lots of people say to me just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn 't mean we should live that way now and i agree with that everyone has to respond to the modern world but the body does have its inherent and so you could live on mcdonald 's and milkshakes but your body will rebel we have appetites i think it was schopenhauer who said a person can do what they want but not want what they want and so what i 'm arguing against is the shame that 's associated with desires it 's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people there 's something wrong with you there 's something wrong with your marriage i think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false vision of human sexuality that 's what i 'm trying to get at"
