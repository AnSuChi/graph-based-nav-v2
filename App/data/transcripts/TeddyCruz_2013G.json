  "transcript": "urban explosion of the last years of economic boom this polarization of enclaves of mega wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered but i want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental it 's particularly a cultural crisis a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing unable to challenge the oil hungry selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption from southern california to new york so i just really want to share with you a reflection that the future of cities today depends less on buildings depends more on the fundamental reorganization of socioeconomic relations that the best ideas in the shaping of the city in the future but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity from which an urgent imagination and let me illustrate what i mean by understanding or engaging sites of conflict which has been the latin america and the united states a physical emblem of exclusionary planning policies that have perpetuated the division of communities in this border region barely twenty minutes away from some of the poorest settlements in latin america and while these two cities have the same population immediately thrusting us to confront so i 've been arguing in the last years the slums of tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of san diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization what do i mean by the informal in this case i 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization i 'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom up with the waste of san diego or the many migrant neighborhoods in southern california that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades so i 've been interested as an artist the observation of many of the trans border informal flows across this border in one direction from south to north the flow of immigrants into the united states and from north to south the flow of waste from southern california into tijuana i 'm referring to the recycling of these old post war bungalows that mexican contractors bring to the border as so these are houses but entire chunks of one city move to the next and when these houses are placed on top of these steel frames they leave the first floor to become the second to be in filled with more house with a small this layering of spaces and economies probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires that are used in the slums to build retaining walls but look at what people have done here in conditions of socioeconomic emergency or the garage doors that are brought from san diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing so while as an architect this is a very compelling thing to witness this creative intelligence i also want to keep myself in check i don 't want to romanticize poverty i just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness the informal is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists that this is about a bottom up urbanization that performs buildings are not important just for their looks but in fact they are important for what they can do they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate so while waste flows southbound and most of my research has had to do with the impact of immigration and i 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of southern california depends on the retrofitting of the large social and economic i 'm referring to how immigrants when they come to these neighborhoods they begin to alter the one dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new inclusive and more equitable land use policies so many stories emerge from these dynamics of which tells the story of a small house that saved itself it did not travel to mexico but it was retrofitted in the end into a buddhist temple and in so doing this small house transforms or mutates from a singular dwelling into a small or a micro socioeconomic and cultural infrastructure so these action neighborhoods as i call them really with belonging to the more with upholding the notion of citizenship as a creative act that reorganizes institutional protocols in the spaces of the city the gathering of many anecdotes urban stories in order to narrativize the relationship between social processes and spaces this is a story of a group of teenagers decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin they barricaded the place and the teenagers were evicted and the teenagers decided to fight back not with bank cards or slogans but with constructing a critical process the first thing they did was to recognize the specificity of political in that empty space they found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under caltrans territoy so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them they were lucky they said because they began to dig under an arm of the freeway because they began to dig in a sort of bermuda triangle of jurisdiction between port authority all these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space they came to the city attorney 's the city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an ngo and of course they didn 't know what an ngo was they had to and they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise to organize budgets to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in san diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space now for many of you this story might seem trivial or naive for me as an architect it has become a fundamental narrative because it begins to teach me that they also taught me they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool because they had to produce a process that enabled them to reorganize resources and the politics of the city in that that act that informal bottom up act of transgression really began to trickle up now this journey to the transformation of the top down is where i find hope today and i 'm thinking of how these modest alterations in primarily the urgency of a collective imagination as these communities reimagine their own forms of governance social organization and infrastructure really is at the center of the new formation of democratic politics of the urban it is in fact this that could become the framework for producing new social and economic justice in the city i want to say this and emphasize it because this is the only way i see that can enable us to move from urbanizations of consumption thank you"
