  "transcript": "delighted to be here and i try to figure out intellectually philosophically psychologically what now this is an extremely complicated subject in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different i mean just think of the sheer variety a baby 's face the wizard of oz or the plays of chekhov a central california landscape a hokusai view of mt fuji der rosenkavalier van gogh 's starry night fred astaire dancing across the screen this brief list includes human beings natural landforms works of art and skilled human actions an account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy i can however give you at least a taste of what i regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have and we get it not from a philosopher of art not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding charles darwin a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question what it 's whatever moves you personally people agree that paintings or movies or music are are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in british museums while shakespeare is translated into every major language of the earth or just think about american jazz or american movies they go everywhere there are many differences among the arts but there are also universal aesthetic pleasures and values how can we explain the best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric largely pleistocene environments where we became fully human but also by the social situations in which we evolved this reverse engineering can also human record preserved in prehistory i mean fossils cave paintings and so forth i personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty belongs to our evolved human psychology the experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of darwinian adaptations beauty is an adaptive effect which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment the first of these is natural selection that 's random mutation and selective retention along with our basic anatomy and physiology the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails such as the horrid smell of rotting natural selection also explains pleasures sexual pleasure the other great principle of evolution is sexual selection and it operates very differently peacock 's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this it did not evolve for natural survival in fact it goes against natural survival no the peacock 's tail results from the mating choices made by peahens it 's quite a familiar story it 's women who actually push history forward darwin himself by the way no doubts that the peacock 's keeping these ideas firmly in mind we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction so to speak i mean you can 't expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape it would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover so evolution 's trick is to make them beautiful to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape a landscape that just happens to be similar to the in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold framed pictures that hang in in living rooms from new york it 's a kind of hudson river school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally get this a path this landscape type is regarded as beautiful even by people in countries that don 't have it the ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience but someone might argue that 's natural beauty how about artistic beauty i 'd like to look back to prehistory to say something about it it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet chauvet caves are about thirty two thousand years old along with a few small realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period but artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you 'd see at an arts and crafts fair as well as ochre body paint have been found from around one hundred thousand years ago so called acheulian hand axes the oldest stone tools are choppers from the olduvai gorge in east africa they go back about two and a half million years these crude tools were around for thousands of centuries until around one point four but often symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form now the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can 't have been made for butchering animals unlike other pleistocene tools the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges and some in any event are too big to use for butchery their symmetry their attractive materials and above all their meticulous workmanship are are simply quite beautiful to our eyes even today so what were these ancient somehow familiar what were these artifacts for practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso unlike hair and feathers the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable you know it 's an old line but it has been shown to work why don 't you come up to my cave so i can show you my hand axes except of course what 's interesting about this is that we can 't be sure how that idea was conveyed this object was made stretching over a million years the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition by the end of the hand axe epic homo sapiens as they were then called finally were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other yes hairstyling i insist on that for us moderns virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies to but still one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings the beauty we find in skilled performances from lascaux to the louvre to carnegie hall human beings have a permanent taste for virtuoso displays in the arts we find beauty in something done well so the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop shaped stone don 't be so sure it 's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful your distant ancestors loved that even before they could put their love into words it 's deep in our minds it 's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient our powerful reaction to images will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists thank you"
