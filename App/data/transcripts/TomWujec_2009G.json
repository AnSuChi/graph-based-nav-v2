  "transcript": "and what i 'd like to argue is that that 's not necessarily the case as progress is simply a word for change but you also lose something and to really illustrate this point what i 'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple a very common an everyday question and that question is this if you glance at your iphone the way you would do it is by using a device an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world but at the time in the 13th century it was the gadget of the day it was the world 's first popular computer if you were an educated child you would know how to not only use the yes that geoffrey chaucer in one thousand three hundred and ninety one to his little lewis and in this book little lewis would and basically the concept is how do you imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere so the north star corresponds to the the ecliptic which is the path of the sun moon and planets correspond to an offset circle and the altitude corresponds to the plate system now the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection the real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly there is the position of the sun moon and planets on the movable rete so how would you use this this is an astrolabe and you can see the different components this is the mater the scales on the back and in the back you can see a spider web pattern and that spider web pattern corresponds to this is a rule device and on the back are some other devices measuring tools and scales to be able to make some calculations okay you i 've always wanted one of these and this one this is a a replica from and but a real one would cost about as much as my house and the house next to it and actually every house on the block on both sides of the street maybe a school thrown in and some you know a church they are just incredibly expensive so let 's go to step one first thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky if you 're telling time at night so second is you measure the altitude of deneb so step two and then i sight twenty six degrees you can 't see it from over there step three is identify the star on the front of the device deneb is there i can tell so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back okay so when that happens it and then finally i take a rule that 's how the device is used isn 't it a ton of work to be able to to tell the time as you glance at your ipod to just check out but there is a difference between the two because with your ipod you can tell or your iphone you can tell exactly what the he would know where things would fit in the sky he would not only know he would know what time the sun in computer graphics and computer user interface design there is a term called affordances to look up into the night sky and be much more that 's just one use incredible there is probably three hundred and fifty four hundred uses in fact there is a text and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer on the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation you can survey with it the city of baghdad was surveyed with it it can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types and it would take a full university astrolabes have an incredible history they are over two thousand years old the concept of stereographic projection originated in three and the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms there is portable ones there is large display ones and i think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art there is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable and advancing retes became cultural emblems this how cool is that probably not one made of brass he would have one made out of wood or paper and the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back back of your pocket well i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful our forebears were years and years ago it 's just an incredible device but what we lose i think is an accurate a felt sense of the sky a sense of of context is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it"
