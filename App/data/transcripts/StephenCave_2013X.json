  "transcript": "and my grandfather had and i remember a few days later lying in bed at night trying to make sense of what had happened what did it mean that he was dead where had he gone it was like could it happen to me too could that hole in reality open up and swallow me would it open up beneath my well and if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory you might remember something like what i felt when my grandfather died and when i realized it could happen to me too and this development in childhood reflects the development of our species just as there was a point in your development as a child when your sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for you to realize you were so at some point in the evolution of our species some early human 's sense of self and of time became sophisticated enough for them to become the first human to realize i 'm going to die this is if you like our curse it 's the price we pay for being so damn clever we have to live in the knowledge that the worst thing that can possibly happen one day surely will the end of all our projects our hopes our dreams of our individual world and so we look for a way out and in my case as i was about five years old this meant asking my mum now when i first started asking what happens when we die the grown ups around me at the time and the phrase i heard most often was that granddad was now up there looking down on us and if i should die too which wouldn 't happen of course then i too would go up there but none of the astronauts when they came back ever mentioned having met my granddad or any other dead people and this thought process that i went through as a child and have been through many times since including as a grown up is a product of what psychologists call a bias now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong and the bias i 'm talking about works like this confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn 't true and they can instead live forever even if it means taking the existential elevator now we can see this as the biggest bias of all it has been demonstrated in over four hundred empirical studies now these studies are ingenious but they 're simple they work like this you take two groups of people who are similar in all relevant respects you remind one group that they 're going to die but not the other then you compare their behavior and every time you get the same result people who are made aware of their mortality so here 's an example one recent study took two groups of agnostics that is people who are undecided in their religious beliefs now one group was asked to think about being dead the other group was asked to think about being lonely they were then asked again about their religious beliefs those who had been asked to think about being dead and it works not just for whether it 's becoming famous or having children or even nationalism which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole the theory behind this bias in the over four hundred studies is called terror management theory and the idea is simple it 's just this we develop our worldviews that is the stories we tell ourselves about the world and our place in it in order to help us manage the terror of death but i believe that behind the apparent diversity there are actually just four basic forms that these immortality stories can take and i want to try to give you some sense of the way in which they 're retold by each culture or generation the first story is the simplest we want to avoid death but actually almost every culture in human history has had some myth or legend of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth or something that promises to keep us going forever hormones had just been discovered genetic engineering but the idea that science can cure death but betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy when we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past it accepts that i 'm going to have to die despite that i can rise up and i can live again i can do what jesus did jesus died he was three days in the [ tomb ] and then he rose up and lived again but our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded for example with the idea of cryonics and then at some point when technology has advanced enough you can be thawed out and repaired and revived and so resurrected and so some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it but for others the whole idea of resurrection of climbing out of the grave just too much like a bad zombie movie the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul now the majority of people on earth believe they have but even though in its current form in its traditional form for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading and that is legacy the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world and the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was it 's even easier to achieve you don 't need to be a great warrior like achilles or a great king or hero all you need is an internet connection and a funny cat but some people prefer to leave a more tangible biological legacy children for example but again there are skeptics who doubt whether legacy really is immortality woody allen for example who said i don 't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen i want to live on in my apartment and the fact that they recur in this way suggests i think that we should be skeptical of the truth of any particular version of these stories the fact that some people believe an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it suggests that neither are really believing this and we are biased to believe them because we are so afraid of death so the question is are we doomed to lead the one life we have in a way that is shaped by fear and denial well the greek philosopher epicurus thought we could but it is not rational death he said is nothing to us because when we are here death is not and when death is here we are gone now this is often quoted but it 's difficult to really grasp to really internalize because exactly this idea of being gone is so difficult to imagine ludwig wittgenstein put it like this and so added in this sense life has no end because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience yet when we see that the now i find it helps to see life as being like a book so our lives are bounded by birth and death the characters within it know no horizons characters of a book are not afraid of reaching the last page long john silver is not afraid of you finishing your copy of treasure island imagine the book of your life its covers its beginning and end and your birth and your death you can only know the moments in between the moments that make up your life it makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers before your birth or after your death the only thing that matters is that you make it a good story"
