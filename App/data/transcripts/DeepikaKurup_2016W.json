  "transcript": "now india is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity for me the only relief from this heat so my parents have to make sure that the water we drink is safe i saw people standing in long lines under the hot sun filling buckets with water from a tap i even saw children who looked the same age as me filling up these clear plastic bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside watching these kids forced to drink water that i felt was too dirty to touch changed my perspective on the world this unacceptable social injustice compelled me to want to find a solution to our world 's clean water but only two point five percent of that is freshwater and less than one percent of earth 's freshwater supply is available for human consumption according to the world health organization so after returning home one summer in eighth i decided that i wanted to combine my passion for solving the global water crisis with my interest in science so i decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a laboratory actually at first i converted my kitchen into a laboratory but my parents didn 't really approve and kicked me out i also read a lot of journal papers on something called solar disinfection or sodis is used to purify water in sodis clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours the uv radiation from the so in order to make the sodis process faster this new method called has recently been used so what exactly is this so what photocatalysis is doing is it 's just speeding up this solar disinfection process when sunlight comes in and strikes a or titanium dioxide it creates hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals but unfortunately there are several disadvantages to the way what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this but like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens to block uv radiation so when they 're coated on the inside of these bottles they 're actually blocking some of the uv radiation and diminishing the efficiency of the process which means they wash off and people end up drinking the catalyst while tio2 is safe and inert it 's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst because then you have to continue to replenish it even after a few uses so my goal was to overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe what started off as an eighth grade science fair project is now my photocatalytic composite for water purification the composite combines titanium dioxide with cement which results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods for example you could create a rod rod that can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use or you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families you can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time now over the course of this my journey hasn 't really been easy you know i was fourteen years old when i started but i didn 't let my age deter me in my interest i founded a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis but when many drops come together they can sustain life on our planet thank you"
