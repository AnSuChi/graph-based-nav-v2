  "transcript": "the serious limitations of existing economic and financial models immediately became apparent oversimplistic and overconfident economics helped create the crisis but this is different this is coming from the heart the second quote head of the uk financial services authority are these people implying that we don 't understand the economic systems that drive our modern societies it gets worse we spend billions of dollars while we still don 't understand the conditions for a stable society a functioning economy or peace but there 's an intriguing solution which is coming from what is known as the science of complexity to explain what this means and what this thing is please let me quickly take a couple of steps back and since then i 've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the so you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics you encode it into equations then predictions can be made and tested we 're actually really lucky that this works because no one really knows why the thoughts in our heads should actually relate to the fundamental workings of the universe despite the success physics has its limits as dirk helbing pointed out in the last quote we don 't really understand the complexity that relates to us that surrounds us this paradox is what got me interested swarms of birds or fish interestingly complex systems are very hard to so the usual physics approach doesn 't really work it turns out that what looks like complex behavior from the outside is actually the result of a few simple rules of interaction this means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system and it gets even better because so this means that the system as a whole suddenly starts to show a behavior which cannot be understood and all of this also means that you can forget about the individual parts of the system complex they are so if it 's a cell or a termite or a bird you just focus on the rules of interaction as a result networks are ideal representations of complex systems the nodes in the network are the system 's components and the links are given by the this approach has been very successfully applied to many complex systems but what about the study we published last year called the study went viral on the internet and it attracted a lot of attention from so and the links represent the shareholding relations so shareholder a has x percent of the shares in so ownership networks reveal the patterns of shareholding relations in this little example you can see a few financial institutions looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like who are the key players how are they organized are they isolated are they interconnected and what is the overall distribution of control in other words this is a measure of how vulnerable a system is overall because then the stress can spread through the system like an epidemic because a foundational guideline in science is let 's do that so we started with a database containing thirteen million ownership relations from two thousand and seven and because we wanted to find out who rules the world we decided to focus on transnational corporations and we found forty three thousand and the and we did the same downstream and ended up with a network containing six hundred thousand nodes so you have a periphery seventy five percent of all the players and in the center there 's this tiny but dominant core which is made up of highly interconnected companies to give you a better picture think about a metropolitan area so you have the suburbs and the periphery you have a center like a financial district and we already see signs of organization going on here percent of the tncs are in the core only but they make up ninety five percent well this is the normal notion of control and there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership but usually it depends on the relative distribution of shares and the network really matters about ten years ago mr tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company which had ownership and control in a bigger company get the idea this ended up giving him control in telecom italia with a leverage of so this means that with each euro he invested he was able to move twenty six euros now what we actually computed in our study was the control over the tncs this is very much in the sense of max weber 's idea of potential power which is the probability of imposing one 's own will despite the opposition of others if you want to compute the flow in an ownership network this is what you have to do it 's actually not that hard to understand let me explain so similarly the control is flowing in the ownership networks so what did we find after computing all this network control well it turns out that the seven hundred and thirty seven top shareholders have the potential to collectively control eighty percent of the tncs ' value now remember we started out with six hundred thousand nodes so these seven hundred and thirty seven top players make up a bit more than zero point one percent they 're mostly mostly financial institutions and it gets even more extreme there are one hundred and forty six top players in the core and they together have the potential to collectively control forty percent of the tncs ' value the high degree of control the high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core and we could easily reproduce the tnc network with a few simple rules this means that its structure is probably the result of it 's an emergent property so it 's probably not the result of a top down approach like a global conspiracy yet it gave us a tantalizing glimpse so and this is slowly starting we 're seeing the emergence of now there is still a big problem in my opinion politics society are very often tainted by people 's personal ideologies i really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common common ground to be found it would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas which appears to be paralyzing our globalized thank you"
