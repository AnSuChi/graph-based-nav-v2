  "transcript": "and working and looking at the internet is that it 's very hard to separate fashion from deep change and so to start helping that i want to take us back to founded the first and it cost about five hundred dollars by fifteen years later by fifteen years that 's the critical change that is being inverted what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information knowledge and which led to a stark bifurcation between producers who had to be able to raise financial capital just like any other industrial organization and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce now the term for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial but in fact for purposes of understanding what 's happening today that 's wrong it 's just been industrial which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to and the television and eventually the mainframe and that meant they were market based or they were government owned depending on what kind of system they were in and this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next one hundred and fifty years let me tell you a different story around june two thousand the japanese had for the first time created the fastest supercomputer the nec earth simulator taking the primary from the u s and about two years later this by the way is measuring the trillion floating point operations per second that the computer 's capable of running earth simulator all of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period there 's another supercomputer running in the world seti @ home four and a half million users by running a screen saver what this picture suggests to us not that it 's become less capital intensive that there 's less money that 's required distributed each of us in these advanced economies has one of these or something rather like it a computer they 're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network and computation storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person and these are the basic knowledge and culture what this means is that for the first time the most important means are in the hands of the population at large this is completely different than what we 've seen since the industrial revolution so we 've got communications and we 've you cannot transmit in that we 're unique and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine what 's the effect of this so the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software this is market share of apache web server in two groups of people said wow this is really important the web we need a much better web server one was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided you know we really need this we should write one and what are we going to do with what well we 're gonna share it and other people will be able to develop it the other was microsoft the motley crew of people who didn 't control anything that they produced acquired twenty percent of the market and was the red line it would be amazing right think of it in minivans a group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with toyota including the major e commerce site seventy percent of a critical application on which communications and applications work is produced in this form in direct competition with microsoft not in a side issue in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the net software has done this in a way that 's been very visible because nasa at some point did an experiment where they took images of mars let 's break it up into small components put it up on the web and see if people using a very simple interface will actually spend five minutes here ten minutes there clicking after six months eighty five thousand people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in which was quote practically indistinguishable from the markings of a once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average and she 'll come to encarta one of the main online encyclopedias this is what you 'll find out about including manufacturers plural now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls like this black barbie including the controversies over body image and the claims about the way in which she 's a good role model etc another portion is not only how content is produced but how relevance is produced the claim to fame of yahoo was we hire people to look originally not anymore if they 're in the index they 're good this on the other hand is what sixty thousand passionate volunteers produce in the open directory project so this is the open directory project no one owns the output it 's free for anyone to use and it 's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting when you think of what is the critical innovation of google the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing the decision about what 's relevant to the community of the web as as a the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers or our people saying which is the most relevant we 're going to go out and count what you people out there on the web every size a contested cultural object which you won 't find anywhere soon on overture which is the classic market based mechanism whoever pays the most is highest on the list so all of that is in the creation of content of relevance basic human expression but remember the computers were also physical just physical materials was one person owned the license and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property what we 're seeing now is that computers and and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we 're developing algorithms to let people own machines like overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this and when you 're not using you 'll help me transfer yours and this is not an idealized version these are working models that at least in some places in the united states are being implemented at least for public security it 's got to be robust to including closing the main index injecting malicious files armed seizure of some major nodes you 'd but of course what i 'm describing is p2p file sharing right where people for very obvious reasons are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something essentially what we 're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework the price system was a market based and decentralized system if things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them you had firms if you wanted to be in the market had governments or sometimes larger it was too expensive to have decentralized social production to have decentralized action but what we 're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange not that it 's the first time that we do nice things to it 's that it 's the first time that it 's having major economic may i do this it 's open for anyone to create and innovate and share if they want to by themselves or with others because property is one mechanism of coordination but it 's not the only one instead what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market information flows to decide what are interesting problems who 's available and good for something you don 't increase the probability of being invited back and if dinner isn 't entirely obvious think of sex you have to hire people who know what they 're doing you have to hire them to spend a lot of time now five minutes i 'll spend just because it 's interesting just because it 's fun gives me a certain set of social relations so a new social phenomenon is emerging it 's creating and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition skype potentially you have new opportunities some of them are toolmakers instead of building well behaved appliances you build platforms for like and you see surfers people who see this happening and in some sense build it into a you have a belief stuff will flow out of connected human beings that 'll give me something i can use and i 'm going to contract with someone i will deliver social production is a real fact not a fad it is the critical long term shift caused by the internet social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon in some contexts it 's even more efficient because of the quality of it 's sustainable and growing fast"
