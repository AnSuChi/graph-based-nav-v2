  "transcript": "when i was about sixteen years old i can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation looking for a movie to watch on hbo and how many of you remember ferris bueller 's day off i saw matthew broderick on the screen and so i thought sweet ferris bueller i 'll watch this it but you weren 't doing ferris y things at the time you were he was in a movie called torch song trilogy and torch song trilogy was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love love love and respect that 's what the whole film was about and as i 'm watching it i 'm realizing that they 're talking about me not the drag queen part i am not shaving my hair for anyone but the part about trying to find your place in the world so as i 'm watching this i see this powerful scene tells his mother as they 're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives i 've taught myself to sew cook fix plumbing furniture i can even pat myself on the back when necessary all so i don 't have to ask anyone for anything there 's nothing i need from anyone except for love and respect and anyone who can 't give me those two things has no place in my life i remember that i was in the closet and i 'm looking at these two people ferris bueller and some guy i 'd never seen before fighting for love there were a lot of people who weren 't as gay as i was gay being happy not gay being attracted to the same sex in fact i heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who i was and the gay lifestyle now i 'm sitting here trying to figure i 've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat if i 'm gay and i 'm doing something that 's going to destroy civilization i need to figure out what this stuff is and i need to stop doing it right now and i saw some things very disturbing and i want to begin sharing these evil things that i 've been doing with you starting with my mornings i get stuck in traffic i look around and i go my god look at all these gay people we 're all trapped in these lines these long lines trying to get on an airplane my god this lifestyle that i 'm living is so freaking evil and because i have a 15 year old all i do is cook and cook and cook any parents out there of teenagers all we do is cook for these people they eat two three four dinners a night it 's ridiculous this is the gay lifestyle and after i 'm done cooking and cleaning and and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic my partner and i we get together and we decide that we 're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun 're usually in bed before we find out who 's eliminated on american idol we have to wake up and find out the next day who 's still on because we 're too freaking tired run for your heterosexual lives people and i and i didn 't know where he was going with it at first he was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with they present them with a pebble this is really cool and he says i want to spend the rest of my life with you so i wear this whenever i have and sometimes i just wear it just because how many people out there are in love anyone in love out there you might be gay because i too am in love and apparently that 's part of the gay lifestyle that i warned you about you may want to tell your spouse how many of you are single any single people out there you too might be gay it 's really scary this gay lifestyle thing it 's super duper evil and there 's no end to it it goes and goes and engulfs it 's really quite silly isn 't it that 's why i 'm so happy to finally hear president obama come out and say a wonderful day in our country 's history it 's a wonderful day in the globe 's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say enough of this it 's wonderful this is just another move by i 've been to all of the functions i 've been to fundraisers i 've written about the topic and i have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda i 've paid my dues on time and i 've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda it 's very very frustrating and i was feeling left out like i wasn 't quite gay enough and i came across and i said to myself lz for so long you have been denied this you 're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder what exactly what are these gays up to what do they want i will present to you ladies and gentlemen now be careful ' cause it 's evil a copy the official copy of the gay agenda you soak it all in the gay agenda some of you may be calling it what the constitution of the united states is that what you call it too the u s constitution is these gays people like me and it 's all written down why didn 't you just call it the constitution so i knew what you were talking about but run for your heterosexual lives did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that that 's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed because there 's no protection from discrimination of glbt people did you know in the states where there 's no shading that you can be fired bisexual or transgendered not based upon the quality of your work how long you 've been there if you stink just if you 're gay all of which flies in the face specifically this little amendment right here no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states but the rights that were already written by these people these elitists if you will some would dare say questionably dressed nonetheless if you will all of that flies in the face of what they did that is the reason why i felt it was imperative that i presented you you wouldn 't be as threatened and you see our state of michigan it 's legal to fire someone lesbian bisexual or transgendered that it 's legal to remove someone from their home then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone 's rights away away it 's about granting them the rights that [ have ] already been stated and we 're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated that we 've already agreed upon there are people living in fear of losing their jobs so they don 't show anyone who they really are all those states it 's legal if i could brag for a second i have a 15 year old son from my marriage he has a four point he 's a budding track star he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in to think as his father and he lives with me primarily that i had a little something to do with all of that i would like to think that he 's a good boy a respectful young man i would like to think that i 've proven to be a capable father but if i were to go to the state of michigan today and try to adopt a young person i would be disqualified for only one reason because i 'm gay it it 's because of what the state of michigan says that i am that i am disqualified for any sort of adoption and that 's not just about me that 's about so many other michiganders u s citizens who don 't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are this story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country 's history there was a time in which i don 't know people who were black couldn 't have the same rights people who happened to be women didn 't have the same rights couldn 't vote there was a point in our history in which if you were considered disabled that an employer could just fire you before the americans with disabilities act we keep doing this over and over again"
