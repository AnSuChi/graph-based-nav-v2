  "transcript": "one of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to and i was just a little kid so i didn 't really understand why but as i got older i realized we had drug addiction in my family including later cocaine been thinking about it a lot lately partly because it 's now exactly one hundred years since drugs were first banned in the united states and britain and we then imposed that on the rest of the world it 's a century since we made this really fateful decision because we believed that would deter them it would give them an incentive to stop and i was looking at some of the addicts in my life who i love and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them and i realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions i just didn 't know the answer to like what really causes addiction why do we carry on with this approach that doesn 't seem to be working so i read loads of stuff about it and i couldn 't really find the answers i was looking for so i thought okay i 'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if i could learn from them and i didn 't realize i would end up going over thirty thousand miles at the start but i ended up going and meeting loads of different people from a transgender crack dealer in brownsville brooklyn to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them it turns out they do but only in very specific circumstances to to the only country that 's ever decriminalized all drugs from cannabis to crack imagine all of you for twenty days now went off and used heroin three times a day than others at this prospect don 't worry it 's just a thought experiment imagine you did that right what would happen now we have a story about what would happen that we 've been told for a century we think because there are chemical hooks in heroin as you took it for a while your body would become dependent on those hooks you 'd that 's what i thought alerted me to the fact that something 's not right with this story is when it was explained to me if i step out of this ted talk today and i get hit by a car and i break my hip i 'll be taken to hospital and i 'll be given loads of diamorphine diamorphine is heroin it 's actually much better heroin than you 're going to buy on the streets because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated actually very little of it is whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure and you 'll be given it for quite a long period of time there are loads of people in this room you may not realize it you 've taken quite a lot of heroin and if what we believe about addiction is right those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks it doesn 't happen you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement she didn 't come out as a junkie the idea of addiction we 've all got in our heads that story comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 're really simple you can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic if you do that the rat will almost always prefer the drug water so there you go right that 's it 's got nothing to do except use these drugs let 's try something different they 've got loads of friends they don 't like the drug water they almost never use it none of them ever overdose you go from almost one hundred percent overdose when they 're isolated maybe this is just a thing about rats different to us maybe not as different as we 'd like but you know but fortunately there was a human experiment into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time it was called the vietnam war and they were really worried because they thought my god we 're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the united states when the war it made total sense now those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home the archives of general psychiatry did a really detailed study and what happened to them it turns out they didn 't go into withdrawal ninety five percent of them now if you believe the story about chemical hooks that makes absolutely no sense but professor alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction said what if addiction isn 't about your chemical hooks what if addiction is about your cage maybe we should call it bonding human beings have a natural and innate need to bond and when we 're happy and healthy we 'll bond and connect with each other if you can 't do that now that might be gambling that might be pornography that but you will bond and connect with something because that 's our nature that 's what we want as human beings i found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around but one way that helped me to think about it is i can see i 've got over by my seat a bottle of water right i 'm looking at lots of you and lots of you have bottles of water with you forget the drugs forget the drug war totally legally all of those bottles of water we could all be getting drunk i might after this but we 're not now not going to do that is not because anyone 's stopping you i came to think and i believe the evidence suggests this has really significant implications the most obvious implications are for the war on drugs in arizona i went out with a group of women who were made to wear and when those women get out of prison they records that mean they 'll never work in the legal economy again we give them criminal records we put barriers between them reconnecting you would design that system now place that decided to do the exact opposite and i went there to see how it worked in the year two thousand portugal had one of the worst drug problems in europe one percent of the population was addicted to heroin they punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more let 's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out and they set up a panel led by an amazing man called dr joo goulo to look at all this new evidence and they came back and they said decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack but and this is the crucial next step take all the money we used to spend on cutting off on disconnecting them and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society and that 's not but the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do so say to be a mechanic when you 're ready they 'll go to a garage and they 'll say if you employ this guy for a year we they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society it 'll be fifteen years this year since that experiment began and the results are in according to the british journal of criminology by fifty percent five zero percent overdose is massively down hiv is massively down among addicts addiction in every study is significantly down one of the ways you know it 's worked so well is that almost nobody in portugal wants to go back to the old system now that 's the political implications i actually think there 's a layer of implications to all this research below that we live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions whether it 's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating before these talks began you guys know this we were told we weren 't allowed to have our smartphones on and i have to say a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours might sound weird to say i 've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it 's growing because you think we 're the most connected society that 's ever been surely but i increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have are like a kind of parody of human connection if you have a crisis in your life you 'll notice something it won 't be your twitter followers who come to sit with you it won 't be your facebook friends who help you turn it round it 'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and textured face to face relationships with and there 's there 's a study i learned about from bill mckibben the environmental writer that i think tells us a lot about this it looked at the number of close friends the average american believes they can call on in a crisis that number has been declining steadily since the 1950s and i think that 's like a metaphor for the we 've traded floorspace for friends we 've traded stuff for connections and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been and we talk all the time in addiction but we need to talk much more about social recovery something 's gone wrong with us not just with individuals but as a group created a society where for a lot of us life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage and a whole lot less like rat park if i 'm honest this isn i didn 't go in to the discover the political stuff the social stuff and when i came back from this long journey and i 'd learned all this i looked at the addicts in my life and if and i think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks i wish someone would just stop you and the kind of scripts we 're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by i think the reality show intervention if you guys have ever seen it i think everything in if you 've ever seen the show intervention it 's a pretty simple premise get an addict all the people in their life gather them together so what they do is they take the connection to the addict and they threaten it they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want and i began to think and i began to think that 's almost like the importing so i was thinking how could i be portuguese and what i 've tried to do now and i can 't tell you i do it consistently and i can 't tell you it 's easy i love you whether you 're using or you 're not i love you whatever state you 're in and if you need me i 'll come and sit with you we love you has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts socially the opposite of addiction is connection"
