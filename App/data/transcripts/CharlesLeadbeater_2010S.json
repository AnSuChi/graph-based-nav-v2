  "transcript": "great pleasure to be here it 's a great pleasure to speak after brian cox from cern i think cern is the home of the large hadron collider what ever happened to the small and it didn 't work the whole hadron collider family needs unlocking the lesson of brian 's presentation in a way all those fantastic pictures is this really so the vantage point you take determines virtually everything that you will see the question that you will ask will determine where would you look to see the future of education the finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there 's a very high suicide and they have absolutely amazing education systems so we all troop off to finland and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it and then we struggle to imagine how we might so for this last year with the help of cisco who sponsored me for some balmy reason to do this i 've been looking somewhere else because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best but it often comes from places where you have huge need unmet latent demand which is what schools and hospitals are so i ended it 's one of the hundreds of favelas in rio most of the population growth of the next fifty years will be in cities almost all of that growth will be in places like monkey hill this is where you 'll find the fastest growing young populations of the world so if you want recipes to work for virtually anything health education government politics and education you have to go to these places and if you go to these places you meet people like this this is a guy called juanderson at the age of fourteen in common with many 14 year olds in the brazilian education system he dropped out of school it was boring and juanderson instead went into what provided kind of opportunity and hope in the place that he lived and by the age of sixteen with rapid promotion he was running the drugs trade in ten favelas he was turning over two hundred thousand dollars a week he employed two hundred people he was going the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in brazil into community centers in favelas and created places like this what turned juanderson around was technology for learning that made learning fun and accessible which is the largest slum in east africa millions of people and there i met these two azra on the left maureen on the right they just finished their kenyan certificate of secondary education that name should tell you that the kenyan education system borrows almost everything from britain circa one thousand nine hundred and fifty they 're private schools there are no state schools in slums and it was in places like this this a school set up by some nuns in another slum called nakuru half the children in this classroom have no parents because they 've died through aids the other half have one parent because the other parent has died through aids it 's the mobile you would start now with or you could go to places like this this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony which is a very developed slum about minutes outside new delhi where i met these the remarkable thing about these girls and the sign of the kind of social revolution sweeping through the developing world is that these girls are not married who have never ever done homework all across the developing world there are millions of parents tens hundreds of millions who for the first time are with children doing homework and exams this is this is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called sugata mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments showing that children in the right conditions can learn on their own with the help of computers imagine what their lives would be like if you could get that to them and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions look at the recipes what do they look like education is a global religion and education plus technology is a great source of hope you can go to places like this this is a school many of them don 't have electricity at home so on and so forth when you go to places like this what you see is and so the idea of a curriculum is completely you need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their settings what does that well our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff but you have to wait quite a long time that 's too waiting ten years for the payoff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs when you 've got siblings to look after or a business to help with so you need often he 's invented more than two hundred games to teach virtually any subject under the sun in the from a lesson or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them sport drama music these things they teach through they attract people to learning because it 's really a dance project or a circus project or the best example of all so el sistema in venezuela uses a violin as a technology of learning taio rocha uses making soap as a technology of learning and what you find when you go to these schemes masses of peer learning how do you get learning to people when there are no teachers well you create your own or you bring in specialist skills but you find ways to get learning that 's relevant to people through technology people and places that are different so this is a school in a bus on a building site in pune the fastest growing city in asia imagine that urban explosion and they all treat learning not as some sort of academic analytical activity but as that 's something that 's productive something you make something that you can do perhaps earn a living from so the trendiest schools in the world high tech high and and he created something called pratham pratham runs preschool play groups for now twenty one million children in india it 's the largest ngo in education in the world and it also supports working class kids going into indian schools he 's a complete revolutionary he 's actually a trade union organizer by background and that 's how he learned the skills to build his organization when they got to a certain stage pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from mckinsey and what you do when you go to any new site is you kind of roll out a franchise and it 's the same wherever you go it 's reliable and people know exactly where they are and there will be no mistakes and madhav said why do we have to do it that way why can 't we do it more yet everyone knows you know a chinese restaurant when you see it these people work with the chinese restaurant model same principles different applications and different settings not the mcdonald 's model so they fail to reach the they often hit their target but miss the point our faith in these systems incredibly fraught and this is just a very simple way of understanding which will sustain an and disruptive innovation that will break it apart create some different way of doing it almost all our effort goes in this box sustaining innovation in formal settings getting a better version of the essentially and as i said the trouble with this is that in the developing world there just aren 't teachers to make this model work you 'd need millions and millions of teachers in china india nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need and in our system we know that simply doing more of this won 't eat into deep educational inequalities so that 's why we need three more kinds of innovation they 're recognizably schools but they look different there are big picture schools in the only two of them are in schools most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools highly collaborative very personalized often pervasive technology learning that starts from questions and problems and projects not from so we certainly need more of that but because so many of the issues in education aren 't just in school they 're in family and community the most famous of these is reggio emilia learning system to support and encourage people in schools the most exciting is the harlem children 's zone attempted to transform not just education in schools but the entire culture and aspiration of about ten thousand families in harlem we need more of that completely new and radical thinking you can go to places an hour away less which need that so we are on the verge actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century from a bismarkian model of german schooling that got taken up by english reformers and often by religious missionaries taken up in the united states as a force of social cohesion and of course it 's a huge achievement and of course it will bring great things it will bring skills and learning and reading but it will also lay waste to imagination it will stratify society as much as it liberates it and we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century trying to reform that is why we need really radical and why radical thinking is now more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn"
