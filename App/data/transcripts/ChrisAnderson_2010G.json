  "transcript": "i mean it 's quite brutal and i 'm also a little nervous about this there are nine billion humans coming our way now because there are circumstances where they can do something really it 's a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into it certainly impacted the way we think about ted 's future and perhaps a child behaving a little strangely this kid is known online as lil demon he 's doing tricks here dance tricks that probably that was sent to me by this man a filmmaker jonathan chu who told me that was the moment he realized the was causing dance to evolve this is what he said at ted in february in essence and so jon had a brilliant idea he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to create this dance troupe the league of extraordinary dancers the lxd i mean these kids were web taught but they were so good that they got to play at the oscars this year and at ted here in february their passion and brilliance just took our breath away this story of the evolution of dance seems strangely familiar you know a while after tedtalks started taking off we noticed that speakers were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation it was resulting in incredible new talks like these two months of preparation crammed into eighteen minutes raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers with the effects that we 've seen this week it 's not as if j j and jill actually ended their talks saying step your game up but they might as well have so in both of these cases you 've got these cycles of improvement apparently driven by people watching web video what is going on here well i think it 's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call and there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear you can think of them as three dials on a giant and the first thing you need is a crowd a group of people who share a common interest the bigger the crowd the more potential innovators there are that 's important but actually most people in the crowd occupy these other roles they 're creating the ecosystem from which innovation emerges the second thing you need is light you and third you need desire you dancers at a street corner but they can all obviously see what each other and the desire part comes i guess from social status right but and amazingly either directly through comments ratings email facebook twitter through links that point google there so it 's easy to find the good stuff and when you 've found it you can watch it in close up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it the desire element is really you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people you get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you and even if it 's not that eloquent and it 's not it can still really make your day possibility of a new type of global recognition i think is driving huge amounts of effort and it 's important to note that it 's not just the stars who are benefiting because you can see the best everyone can learn also the system is self fueling it 's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own because it means you have to open up it 's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it and very happily there 's one class of people who really can 't make use of this tool i don 't think we 're going to see terrorists for example publishing their plans online and saying to the world please could you help us to actually make them work this time look out so at ted we 've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness in fact we opened up our and thereby making it easier for us to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers by opening up our translation program thousands of heroic volunteers some of them watching online right now and thank you thereby tripling our viewership in non english speaking countries by giving away our tedx brand and these organizers the wheel is turning step back a minute i mean it 's really not news for me to tell you that innovation emerges out of groups you know we 've heard that this week this romantic notion of the lone genius with the is misleading even he said that and he would know we 're a social species we spark off each other it powerful communities have been connecting online but what 's key here is the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally and that 's why what i 'm excited about and what i think is is the significance of the rise of online video this is the technology thereby launching a whole new cycle of crowd accelerated innovation bandwidth has cisco actually estimates that within four years more than ninety percent of the web 's data will be video if it 's all puppies porn and piracy we 're doomed i don 't think it will be for a reason it packs a huge amount of data and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it here let me introduce you to sam haber he 's a unicyclist before youtube but looking at video clips and there are thousands of other examples of this happening of video driven evolution of skills ranging from the and i have to tell you as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines i find this but if rube goldberg machines and video poetry aren 't quite your cup of tea how about this jove is a website that was founded to encourage scientists to publish their peer reviewed research there 's a problem with a traditional scientific paper it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in here 's one such frustrated scientist moshe pritsker the founder of jove he told me that the world is wasting billions of dollars on this i mean look if you can show instead of just describing that problem goes away so it 's not far fetched to say that at some point online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance why do people like watching tedtalks all those ideas are already out there in print it 's actually faster to read than to view why would someone there 's some serious magic somewhere hidden in british body the sense of how the audience are reacting there are hundreds of subconscious clues that go to how well you will understand and whether you 're inspired incredibly all of this can be communicated on just a few square inches of a screen reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions face to face communication millions of years of evolution that 's what 's made it into this mysterious powerful thing it is i mean this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action it 's probably driven our culture for millennia five hundred years ago it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage it 's right here print the world 's ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine it 's not too much to say that what gutenberg did for writing online video can now do for face to face communication so that primal medium which your brain is exquisitely wired for that just went global today one person speaking can be seen by millions creating intense desire for learning and to respond and in his case intense desire to laugh time in talented students don 't have to have their ted is the world 's universities are opening up their curricula thousands of individuals and organizations are sharing their knowledge and data online thousands of people are figuring out new ways to learn and crucially to respond completing the cycle and so as we 've thought about this you know it 's become clear to us what the next stage of ted 's evolution has to be tedtalks can 't be a maybe even your own tedtalks and to help shine a light on the very best of what 's out there because if we can bubble up the very best from a vastly larger pool this wheel turns is it possible to imagine a similar process to this happening to global education overall does it have to be this it 's the participation age right schools can 't be silos we can 't stop learning at age twenty one what if in the coming crowd of nine billion what if that crowd could learn enough to be net contributors instead of net plunderers that changes everything right i mean but the good news is they are out there they and we can see them for the first time not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers but as individuals we can learn from you 're part of the crowd that may be about to launch a cycle capable of carrying all of us to a smarter wiser more within five years each of these kids is going to have access to a cellphone capable of full on web video and capable of uploading video to the web i mean is it crazy to think that this girl in the back at the right in fifteen years might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful for your grandchildren it 's actually happening right now good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa 's biggest shantytown christopher makau there are so many good things which are they are using flip we are using the sacks i see kibera in a different way bet chris has always been an inspiring guy what 's new and it 's huge chris and kevin and dennis and dickson and their friends guys"
