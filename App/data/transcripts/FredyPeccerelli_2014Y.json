  "transcript": "guatemala is recovering from a 36 year armed conflict a conflict that was fought during the cold war it was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state what we have as a result is two hundred thousand civilian victims one hundred and sixty thousand of those killed in the communities small children men women the elderly even the ones we 're still looking for today we call them now eighty three percent of the victims are mayan victims victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of central america and only about seventeen percent are of european descent but the most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us the police the military are the ones that committed most of the crimes but most of all what they want is they want you they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong now my case was that my father received death threats so i grew up in new york i grew up in brooklyn as a matter of fact and i went to new utrecht high school the only thing was that i really didn 't know what was happening in guatemala i didn but it wasn 't decided to so i went back i went back to guatemala the way we work is that we give people information we talk to the family members and we let them choose and even more important we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves a piece an essence of who they are and that dna is what we 're going to compare to the dna that comes from the skeletons we 're looking for the bodies and these are skeletons by now most of these crimes happened so here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound for example whether it 's a baby but when we 're done with that analysis what we 'll do is we 'll take a small fragment of the bone and we 'll extract dna from it we 'll take that dna and then we 'll compare it with the dna of the families now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in one thousand nine hundred and they of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them inside that yellow rectangle you see a code it 's a secret code three hundred now that 's going to come into play in a second what we did is we conducted an exhumation in two thousand and three where we exhumed two hundred and twenty in a military base grave nine though matched the family of sergio saul linares now sergio was a professor at the university and he was captured on february and if you can see there he was executed on march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four which was another match from the same grave the dna of that body also matched the dna of that family but it was amazing to see that he was also executed on march six so then we said how many people were executed on march twenty nine one thousand nine hundred and eighty four that 's right six moises all captured at different locations and at different moments the only thing we needed now was the dna of those four families so we went and we looked for them and we found them and we identified those six bodies the other case i want to tell you about is that of a military base called to believe in peace but the acronym really means regional command center for peacekeeping operations and this is where the guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries the ones that serve with the u n and go to countries like haiti and the congo so we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in we found the first of now if you think about that but the bodies blindfolded all types of trauma these were people who were defenseless who were being executed people that five hundred and thirty three families are looking for so we 're going to focus on grave fifteen grave fifteen what we noticed was a grave full of women and children sixty three of them my goodness where is there a case like this when i got to guatemala in one thousand nine i heard of a case of a massacre that happened on may fourteen and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location well guess what the clothing from this grave matched both of them disappeared in that case we could prove it we have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people were taken to this base now manuel chen was three years old his mother went to to the river to wash clothes and she left him with a neighbor so now with science but we 're doing more than that we 're actually providing evidence for trials so i came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere it 's happening in mexico right in front of us today and we 't let it go on anymore we have to now thank you"
