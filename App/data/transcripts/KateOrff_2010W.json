  "transcript": "i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan has really shaped our history and our character but one thing is clear in the last one hundred years alone our country and this is a a sprawl map of america our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we 've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet and so how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re imagine these connections and physically rebuild them sea levels rising and climate changing so when i also think about design i think about trying to arrow here indicating you are here so the era of big infrastructure is over i mean these sort of devoid of context is really not the excuse me it 's fairly blatant is is really so we need new stories new heroes and and new tools so now i want to introduce you to my new hero and that is the eastern oyster so albeit a very small creature and very modest this creature is incredible because it can agglomerate into these mega reef structures so the oyster was urban design project that i did about the new york harbor called the core idea of oyster tecture is to harness the biological power eelgrass and oysters species that live in the harbor and at the same time harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now here 's a map of my city new york city showing inundation in red and what 's circled the site that i 'm going to talk about the gowanus canal showing everything in blue is out in the water and everything in yellow is upland but you can see even just intuit from this map that the harbor has dredged and flattened and went from a rich three dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years another set of views of actually the gowanus canal itself now the gowanus is particularly smelly i will admit it there are problems of sewage overflow and contamination but i would also argue that almost every city has this exact and it 's a condition that we 're all facing and here 's a map of that condition showing the contaminants in we really had a lot to deal with and you can see from this map there 's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and so our concept is really this back to the future concept harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern and the idea has two core stages one is to develop a new artificial ecology a reef out in the harbor that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the gowanus because if you have cleaner water and slower water you can imagine a new way of living with that water so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way i think it accepts algae and detritus in one end and through this beautiful glamorous set of stomach organs out the other end comes cleaner water and one oyster can filter up to fifty gallons of water a day basically new york was built on the backs of oystermen and our streets were literally built over oyster shells this image is an image of an oyster cart we got the short end of the deal there and they become the bedrock of so we were inspired by the oyster but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster it can move from a fertilized egg to a spat which is when they 're floating through the water and when they 're ready to attach onto another oyster to an adult male oyster or female oyster in a number of weeks we reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the gowanus as a giant oyster nursery and so the core idea here was to hit the reset button it 's very very core concept here is that climate change isn 't something that the answers won 't land down from the moon and with a $ twenty billion price tag we should simply start and get to work with what we have now and what 's in front of us so this image is simply showing it 's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope it 's just that it 's this very inexpensive thing available practically at your hardware and it 's very cheap so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project rather than drawing we began to learn how to knit the concept was to really knit this rope together and develop this new soft infrastructure for the oysters to grow on and that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change in the end what we realized we were making was a new so you can imagine scuba diving here this is an image of high school students scuba divers that we worked with on our team so you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in another new vocabulary word for the brave new world this is the word flupsy it 's short for floating upwelling system and this glorious readily available device so the water is churned through this raft you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force feed them so rather than having ten oysters you have ten thousand oysters and then those spat are then seeded here 's the gowanus future with the oyster rafts on the shorelines how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef i get asked two but we imagine with our calculations that by two thousand and fifty you might be able to sink your teeth into a gowanus oyster to conclude this is just one cross section of one piece of my dream is my hope is that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable a more livable and a more delicious future"
