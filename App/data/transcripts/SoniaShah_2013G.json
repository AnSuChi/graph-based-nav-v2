  "transcript": "over the long course of human history the infectious disease that 's killed more humans than any other is malaria it 's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos and it 's probably our oldest scourge we may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes and to this day malaria takes a huge toll on our species we 've got three hundred million cases a year and over half a million deaths 1600s that 's when jesuit missionaries in peru discovered the bark of the cinchona tree and inside that bark was quinine still an effective cure we 've known how to prevent malaria since that 's when the british army surgeon ronald ross discovered not bad air or miasmas as was previously thought so and yet to this day hundreds of thousands of people are going to die from the bite of a mosquito why is that this is a question that 's and because i had no immunity to the local malarias i was made to sleep under sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice cool night breeze wafting over them and i really hated the mosquitos for that but at the same time i come from a jain family and jainism is a religion that espouses a very so jains are not supposed to eat meat we 're not supposed to walk on grass because you could you know inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass so the fearsome power of this little insect was apparent to me from a very young age and it 's one reason why i spent five years as a journalist trying to understand why has malaria been such a horrible scourge for all of us for so very long and i think there 's three main reasons those three reasons add up to the fourth reason which is probably the biggest reason of all the first reason is certainly scientific it lives half its life inside the cold blooded mosquito and half its life inside but not only that they 're both utterly hostile it has more ways to evade attack than we know it 's a shape shifter for one thing just as a caterpillar turns into a butterfly the malaria parasite transforms so say you came up with some great drug that worked against one stage of the parasite 's life cycle it might do nothing at all to any of the other stages it can hide in our bodies undetected unbeknownst to us for days for weeks so the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in so you might think then well why don 't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live but say you live in the tropics and you walk outside your hut one day and you leave some footprints in the soft dirt around your home or say your cow does or say your pig does and then say it rains and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water that 's it you 've created the perfect malarial mosquito habitat that 's right outside your door so there 's a huge scientific challenge but there 's a huge economic challenge too malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on earth and there 's a reason for that if you 're poor you 're more likely to get malaria you 're less likely to have door screens or window screens you 're less likely to have electricity and all the indoor activities that electricity makes possible so you 're outside more you 're getting bitten by mosquitos more so poverty causes malaria but what we also know now is that malaria itself but it also predisposes people to death from all other causes so this has happened historically we 've been able to take malaria out of but just if you take malaria out deaths from everything else go down what it means is if you have malaria in your society your economic growth is depressed by one point three percent year after year after year just this one disease alone because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine how do you deliver it in a place where there 's no roads but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge there 's also a cultural challenge and this is probably the part about malaria that people don 't like to talk about and it 's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least they ask people in malarious parts of the world what do you think about malaria and they don 't say it 's a killer disease we 're scared of it they say malaria is a normal problem of life and that was certainly my personal experience when i told my relatives in india that i was writing a book about malaria they kind of looked at me like i told them i was writing a book about warts or something like why would you write about something so boring and so in her lived experience malaria is something that comes and goes and that 's actually true for most of the world 's malaria most of the world 's malaria comes and goes on its own it 's just there 's so much malaria that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death add up to this big huge number right cold and flu have huge burden on our societies and on our on our own lives but we don 't really even take the most rudimentary precautions against it because we consider it normal to get cold and flu during cold and flu season and so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria because if people think it 's normal then how do you get them to run to the doctor to pick up their prescription to get it filled to take the drugs to put on the repellents to tuck in the bed nets it 's economically challenging to deal with and it 's one for which the people who stand to benefit the most care about it the least and that adds up to the biggest problem of all which of course is the political problem 't but this i think introduces a whole host of other they understood the cultural challenge in fact their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria shouldn 't be asked to do anything at all everything should be they had so much faith in their tools and public opinion started to turn against those tools they had no scientific expertise to figure out what to do the whole campaign crashed malaria resurged back but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest to reach places in the most forms one who official at the time actually called that whole campaign one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health the latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s it 's similarly directed but now i think the dilemma is the cultural challenge it 's treated with insecticides this thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions and when you think about the bed net and they have to do that even if the net blocks the breeze even if they might have to get up in the middle of the night and relieve themselves even if they might have to move all their furnishings to put this thing up even if you know now that 's no big deal if you 're fighting a killer disease i mean but that 's not how people with malaria think of malaria so for them the calculus must be quite different we 've designed this great easy to use cheap tool we 're going to give it to you for free it 's called a face mask and all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work would we do that and i wonder if that 's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them indeed and even that 's probably an overestimate because the same people who distributed the nets went back and asked the recipients oh did you use that net i gave you but that 's not an insurmountable problem we can do more education we can try to convince these people to use the nets and that 's what happening now we 're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you but it takes time it takes money it takes resources it takes infrastructure it takes all the things that that cheap easy to use bed net was not supposed to be so it 's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies but it 's equally tricky we end up imposing our own priorities on the people of the malarious world that 's exactly what we did in the 1950s and that effort backfired i would argue today when we are distributing tools that we 've designed we run the risk of making the same mistake again that 's not to say that malaria is unconquerable because i think it but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it and we got rid of it completely not because we attacked malaria we didn 't we attacked bad roads and bad bad houses and by doing that we slowly built malaria out and attacking the malarious way of life it 's not fast it thank you so much"
