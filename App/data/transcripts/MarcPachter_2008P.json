  "transcript": "the national portrait gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great american lives amazing people and that 's what it 's about we use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives i 'm going to talk about a program i started there which from my point of view is the the proudest thing i did i started to worry about the fact that a lot of people don 't get their portraits painted anymore and they 're amazing people and we want to deliver them to future and the living and so what i 'm going to do is not so much give you the great hits of that program as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation what you try to find out about them and when people deliver and when they don 't and why now i had two preconditions one was that they be american that 's just because in the nature of the national portrait gallery it 's created to look at american lives that was easy but then i made the decision maybe arbitrary that they needed to be which at that point when i created this program seemed really old sixties but the second part of it and the older i get the more it 's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out that 's the one advantage that older people have well they have other little bit of advantage but they also have some disadvantages but the one thing they or we have is that we 've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out so we can then go back in our lives if we 've got an interviewer who gets that and begin to reflect on how we got there all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited now what is it going to take to make this work we know them there are the journalist interviews which are the interrogation that is expected this is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee then the celebrity interview where it 's more important who 's asking the question than who answers that 's barbara walters and others like that and we we like that that 's but i wanted interviews that were different i wanted to be as i later thought of it empathic which is to say to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their by the way this was always done in public this was not an oral history program this was all about three hundred people sitting at the feet of this individual and having me be the and i thought it was worth a chance he thought it was worth a chance and so we got up on the and after that where did you train as a doctor i never claimed that and she said well something very weird was happening when he started a sentence particularly in the early parts of the interview he was speaking complete sentences on his own i didn 't know what was going on but i was so but then i began to think of other things some of them were very brilliant some of them were it was about their energy these were people through their 90s in fact the first person i interviewed was george abbott who was ninety seven the room and we had an extraordinary conversation he was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two and in fact he did wind up opening up by the way his energy is evidenced in other ways he subsequently got married again at one hundred and two but after the interview i got a call did you get george abbott to talk apparently i did and she said i and i could never do it and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk you know you want energy you want the life force but the worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest never ever get up on a stage with somebody who 's modest because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them and they sit there and they say aw shucks it was an accident there 's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking the worst interview i ever did william l shirer the journalist who did the rise and fall of the third reich this guy had met hitler and gandhi within six months and every time i 'd ask him about it he 'd say oh i just happened to be there i never would ever agree to interview a modest person they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you but it comes down in the end to how do you get through all the barriers we have all of us are public and private beings and if all you 're going to get from the interviewee is their public self there 's no point in it it 's pre programmed it 's infomercial we know the mike wallace 's old interviews tough aggressive and so forth they have their place i was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say to break out of their own and the more public they had been the more entrenched that outer person was and let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series it all has to do with that shell that most of us have and particularly certain people there 's an extraordinary woman named clare boothe luce it 'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you she did so much she was a playwright she did an extraordinary play called the women she was she was she was sort of adored on the right the way eleanor roosevelt was on the left and in fact when we did the interview i did the the living self portrait with her there were three former directors of the cia basically sitting at her feet just enjoying her presence and i thought this is going to be a piece of cake because i always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe ten or fifteen minutes we never talk before that because if you talk before you don 't get it on the stage so she and i had a delightful conversation we were on the stage and then by the way spectacular it was all part of clare boothe luce 's look she was in a great evening gown she was eighty almost that day of the interview and there she was and there i was and i just proceeded into the questions and she stonewalled me it was unbelievable anything that i would ask she would turn around dismiss and i was basically up there any of you in the and i began to wonder what was going on and you think while you talk for that and so then i asked her a question i didn 't know how i was going to get out of it i asked her a question about and again characteristically instead of saying was a playwright and this is what blah blah blah she said oh playwright everybody knows i was a playwright most people think that i was an actress i was never an actress and she said oh well there was that one time that i was an actress it was for a charity in connecticut when i was a congresswoman and i got up and she went on and on and then i got on the stage and then she turned to me and said and you know what those young actors did they upstaged me and she said do you know what that is just withering in her contempt and i said i 'm learning and she looked at me and it was like the successful arm wrestle and then after that she delivered an extraordinary account of what her and the way she died she had toward the end a brain tumor that 's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine and very few of us were invited to a dinner party we all knew that she stayed in the usual sort of thing then at a certain moment the door opened and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room now there are other ways that you get somebody to open up and this is just a brief reference it wasn 't this arm wrestle but it was a little surprising for the person involved i interviewed steve and we were sitting there and almost toward the beginning of the interview i turned to him and i said steve or mr martin it is said that all comedians have unhappy was yours unhappy and he looked at me you know as if to say this is how you 're going to start this thing right off and then he turned to me not stupidly what was your childhood like and i said these are all arm wrestles but they 're affectionate and i said my father was loving and supportive which is why i 'm not funny and he looked at me and then we heard the big sad story his father was an sob and in a five volume biography of thomas jefferson spent virtually his whole life with thomas jefferson and by the way at one point i asked him would you like to have met him and he said but actually i know him better than anyone who ever met him because i got to read all of his letters and i asked him one question i said did jefferson ever disappoint you and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with well he said i 'm afraid so and sometimes mr jefferson would smooth the truth a bit and he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he he said but i understand that he said i understand that he said we southerners do like so that there were times when he just didn 't want the confrontation and he said now john adams was too honest and he started to talk about that and later on he invited me to his house and i met his wife who was from massachusetts and he and and most of the times when i talk about it people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity or cruelty it was the right question this was to agnes de mille agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers in our history she basically created the dances in oklahoma transforming the american theater an amazing woman at the time that i proposed to her that by the way i would have proposed to her she was extraordinary but proposed to her that she come on she said to my apartment she lived in new york come to my apartment and we 'll talk for those fifteen minutes and then we 'll decide whether we proceed and so i showed up in this and so she spent almost all of her life in bed but i speak of the life force and she was sitting there surrounded by books and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will which she had by her side and i change it all the time she agreed she came on of course she was wheelchaired on half of her body was stricken the other half not done up for the occasion but this was a woman in great physical and we had a conversation and then i asked her this unthinkable question i said was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful and she literally turned here she in this broken body and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and and then she said and then puberty hit and she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face and how she could no longer count on her beauty and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one whom all the ballet lessons were given and she had to go along just to be with her sister for company and in that process she made a number of decisions first of all was that dance even though it hadn 't been offered to her was her life and secondly she had better be although she did dance for a while a choreographer because then her looks didn 't was thrilled to get that out as a real real fact in her life it was an amazing privilege to do this the key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are and i commend that to you even if you 're not doing interviews just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family"
