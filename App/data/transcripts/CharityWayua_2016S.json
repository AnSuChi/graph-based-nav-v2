  "transcript": "see i and i wanted and i loved it i returned to kenya to do just that ready to take on this horrific illness which in kenya was almost certainly a death sentence i found myself drawn to a different kind of lab working with a different kind of patient a patient who needed to get healthy fast that patient was my government see many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today and kenya was no exception when i returned to kenya in two thousand and fourteen there was seventeen percent youth unemployment and nairobi the major business hub was rated on the quality of living index it was bad now an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up everyone and everything suffers sometimes you might put a band aid in place maybe some of you here have participated in a band aid operation to an african country setting building hospitals digging wells because governments there either weren 't or couldn 't provide the services to their citizens band aids can 't fix like providing an environment where businesses feel secure that they 'll have an equal opportunity to be able to run and start their businesses successfully or there are systems in place that would protect the private property that they create i would argue only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive economies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop business owners create new sources of income for themselves new jobs get added into the economy and then more taxes are paid to fund public projects new business is good for everyone and as you can imagine starting or running a business in a country with an ailing government almost impossible he came to our lab and asked us to partner with him he set an ambitious goal he wanted kenya to be ranked top fifty in this world bank ranking in two thousand and fourteen when he came kenya was ranked one hundred and he came to the right place we 're not just a band aid kind of team we engineers and a cancer researcher who understood that in order to cure the sickness of a system as big as and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs into the tissues all the way to single cells so that we could properly make a diagnosis collecting data all the data we could get our hands on making hypotheses creating solutions one after the other so we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies we documented their processes most of them were manual we also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork to try and really understand to try and diagnose what bodily malfunctions had occurred that lead to that 136th spot on the world bank list what did we find well in kenya it was taking seventy two days for a business owner to register their property compared to just one day in new zealand which was ranked second on the world bank list if you wanted to get a construction permit so you could put up a building in kenya it was going to take you one hundred and twenty five days twenty six days because that process alone would take you four hundred and and if that wasn 't bad enough for there to exist such inefficiencies in an i thought so too actually when we started out i thought i i was literally going to either die or get killed in the process but when we dug deeper we didn 't find corruption in the classic sense slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness waiting to grease the palms of their friends what we found was an overwhelming sense of helplessness our government was sick because government employees and when people feel stuck and and helpless they stop seeing their role in a bigger system and when that happens things slow down fall through the cracks now imagine with me if you had a process complex and very i think you might start by trying to find somebody to outsource it to so that they can just take care of that for you if that doesn 't work maybe you 'd consider paying somebody to just unofficially take care of it on your behalf especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you not out of malice or greed just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you so you can move on we had to start by making sure that every single stakeholder we worked with so we met with everyone from the clerk whose sole job is to remove staples from application packets to the legal drafters at the attorney general 's office we made sure were impacting our ability as a country to create new jobs and to attract investments no one 's role was too small everyone 's role was vital and together we started to implement changes that impacted the service delivery of our country the result in just two years kenya 's ranking moved from one hundred and and in recognition of the significant reforms we 've been able to implement in such a short time kenya was recognized to be among the top three global reformers in the world two years in a row are we fully healthy i like to think about these two years like a now but think with me for just a moment when is the last tried to do your taxes on your own we can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient too corrupt unfixable we might even rarely get some key government responsibilities to other sectors to band aid solutions or to just but just because a system is sick we cannot afford to give up when it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments in the end what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells that 's you and i refuse to be helpless and believe that sometimes all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive"
