  "transcript": "the cdc and kaiser permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of ten of the leading causes of death in the united states in high doses it affects brain development and even the way our dna is read and transcribed folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a difference in life and yet doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment now the exposure i 'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical it 's childhood trauma okay what kind of trauma am i talking about here i 'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game i am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence i viewed these things in the way i was trained to view them either as a social problem refer to social services or as a mental health problem refer to mental health services and then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach when i finished my residency i wanted to go someplace where i felt really needed someplace where i could make a difference we opened a clinic in now prior to that point there had been only one pediatrician in all of bayview to serve more than ten thousand children it was so cool we targeted the typical health disparities but then i started noticing a disturbing trend a lot of kids were being referred to me for but when i actually did a thorough history and physical what i found was that for most of my patients i couldn 't make a diagnosis of adhd most of the kids i was seeing had experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else was going on somehow i was missing something important before i did my residency i did a master 's degree in public health and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you 're a doctor and you see one hundred kids that all drink from the same well and ninety eight of them develop diarrhea you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics or you can walk over and say what the hell is in this well and he said dr burke have you seen this in his hand was a copy of a research study called the adverse childhood experiences study that day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career the adverse childhood experiences study is something that everybody needs to know about it was done by dr vince felitti at kaiser and dr bob anda at the cdc and about their history of exposure to what they called adverse childhood experiences or aces or domestic violence for every yes you would get a point on your ace score what they found was striking two things number one aces are incredibly common the second thing that they found was that there was a relationship the worse your health outcomes for a person with an ace score of four or more their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ace score of zero it was twelve times a person with an ace score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer well of course some people looked at this data and they said come on you have a you 're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health this isn 't science this is just bad behavior it turns out this is exactly we now understand better than we ever have before it affects areas like the nucleus accumbens the pleasure the brain 's response center so there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity you 're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer and body 's stress response system that governs our response how does it work which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says release stress hormones adrenaline cortisol and so your heart starts to pound your pupils dilate your airways open up and you are ready to either fight that bear and that is wonderful if you 're in a forest and there 's a bear but the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night and it goes from being adaptive or to maladaptive or children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation because their brains and bodies are just developing high doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function they affect the developing immune system so for me this information threw my old training out the window because when we understand the mechanism of a disease when we know not only which pathways are disrupted but how then as doctors it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment that 's what we do so in san francisco we created the center for youth wellness screen and heal the impacts of aces and toxic stress we because i know that if my patient has an ace score of four she 's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or copd she 's four and half times as likely to become depressed and she 's twelve times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero aces i know that when she 's in my exam room we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices including home visits holistic so the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops because this isn 't just an issue for kids in bayview i figured the minute that everybody else heard about this it would be routine screening multi disciplinary treatment teams and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols and that was a huge learning for me what i had thought of as simply best clinical practice i now understand to be a movement in the words of dr robert block the former president of the american academy of pediatrics adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health health threat facing our nation today the scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it but for me that 's actually where the hopes lies because when we have the right framework when we recognize this to be a public health crisis then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions from tobacco to lead poisoning to hiv aids but replicating those successes with aces and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment and when i look at what our nation 's response has been so far i wonder you know at first i thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn 't apply to us that 's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods which is weird because the data doesn 't bear that out the original aces study was done in a population that was seventy percent caucasian seventy percent college educated but then the more i talked to folks i 'm beginning to think that maybe i had it completely if i were to ask how many people in this room i bet a few more hands would go up even in this room maybe it 's easier to see in other zip codes because we don 't want to look at it we 'd rather be sick make that option less viable every day the science is clear early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime and thirty years from now the child who has a high ace score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer aids people will look at that situation and say what the heck happened there this is treatable this is beatable the single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face and say this is real i believe thank you"
