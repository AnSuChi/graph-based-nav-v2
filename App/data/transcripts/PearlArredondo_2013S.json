  "transcript": "everyone knew who i was so i thought i was a pretty big i had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent she worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean 's office so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class for whatever reason who were waiting to be disciplined but that doesn 't mean that we can 't it just takes a little bit more like i remember one day i found my dad convulsing foaming at the mouth od ing on the bathroom floor really do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list not i really needed a support network a group of people who were going to help me make sure that i wasn 't going to be a victim of my own circumstance that they were going to push me beyond what i even thought i could do i needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say you can move beyond that and unfortunately the local huge teacher turnover rate so my mom said you 're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live and eventually i ended up at a school where there was a mixture there were some people who were really gang affiliated and then there of us really trying to make it to high school well trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable you had to survive you just had to do things sometimes she 's not going to go anywhere but then they were very surprised and then i told them i want to be a teacher and boy they were like and i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me so as a rookie teacher i created i was like you need to go to a hospital the school nurse something he 's like no miss i 'm not going i need to be in class because i need to graduate so he knew that i was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance but we were going to push forward and keep moving on and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they 're going through getting to know their families but i couldn 't do it in a school with one thousand six and teachers turning over year after year after year how do you get to build those relationships and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding for support but with that we were going to gain freedom freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective and freedom to control a budget to spend money where it matters not how a district or a state says you have to do it but now shifting but we had to do it our community deserved a new way of doing things and it was out of fear fear of so even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts you don 't get to be at my school with how did we do it we 're making school worth coming to every day we make our kids feel like they matter to us and they use all the technology that they 're used to laptops tablets you name it they have it animation software moviemaking software they have it all and because we connect it to what they 're doing these were played in the local trolley system teaching elements of persuasion it doesn 't get any more real than that but it 's taken all stakeholders working and it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say know the district is trying to impose this but you have the freedom to do otherwise and it takes an active parent center who is not only there because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live they deserve a quality school in their neighborhood a school that they can be proud to say they attend and a school that the community can be proud and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances because it 's time that kids like me and we become the norm"
