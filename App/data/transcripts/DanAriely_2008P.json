  "transcript": "you a little bit about irrational behavior not yours of course other people 's so after being at mit for for a few years i realized that writing academic papers so i decided to try and write something more fun and i came up with an idea that i would write a cookbook and the title for my cookbook was going to be dining without crumbs the art of eating over the sink and it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen i was quite excited about this i was going to talk a little bit about research a little bit about the kitchen not for us look if you 're serious about this you have to write about your research first you have to publish something then you 'll get the opportunity to write something else if you really want to do it you have to do it i said i don 't want to write about my research i do it all day long i want to write something a bit more free less constrained and this person was very forceful and said look that 's the only way you 'll ever do it so i said okay if i have to do it i had a sabbatical about my research if there 's no other way and then i 'll get to do my cookbook so i wrote a a book on my research and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways first of all i enjoyed writing but the more interesting thing was that i started learning from people people write to me about their personal experience and about their i 've known heights of obsessive behavior i never thought about i will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior and i want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality or the horizontal can anybody see anything but the left one being longer no right it 's impossible so i can put some lines on it doesn 't help i can animate the lines and to the extent you believe i didn 't shrink the lines which i didn 't i 've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you you can 't look at this and say now i see reality as it is right it 's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer our intuition is really aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it what color is the top arrow pointing to audience brown dan ariely brown thank you the bottom one turns out they 're identical if i cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are if you don 't believe me you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see the illusion comes back there is no way for us not to see this illusion i guess maybe if you 're colorblind i don 't think you can see that i want you to think about illusion as a metaphor we use our vision more hours of the day which we 're so good at what are the chances we won 't make even more mistakes in something we 're not as good at for example financial decision making something we don 't have an evolutionary reason to do we don 't have a specialized part and worse not having an easy way to see them because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes in cognitive illusion it 's much much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people so i want to show you some cognitive it 's from paper by johnson and goldstein it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs these are different countries in europe you basically see two types of countries countries on the right that seem to be giving a lot and countries on the left that seem to giving very little or giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society how linked you are or maybe it 's about religion but if you look at this plot actually exhibit very different and austria the netherlands is on the left and belgium is on the right and finally depending on your particular version of european similarity you can think about the u k and france as either similar culturally or not but it turns out that with organ donation they are very different by the way the netherlands an interesting story you see the netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group it turns out that they got to to twenty eight percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program you know the expression begging only gets you so far it 's twenty eight percent in the countries on the left have a form at the dmv that looks something like this check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program and what happens people don 't check the ones that give a lot have a slightly different form but now they join now think about what this means you know we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions we wake up in the morning and we open the closet we feel that we decide what to wear we open the refrigerator and we feel that we they are residing in the person who is designing that form when you walk into the dmv the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you 'll end up doing now and you went to the dmv we have such a feeling that we 're in the driver 's seat such a feeling that we 're in control and we are making the decision that it 's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision rather than an actual now you might say so a standard economist somebody who believes in rationality would say you know what the cost of lifting the pencil and marking a v is higher than the possible benefit of the decision so that 's why we get this effect we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us i 'll give you one more example this is from a paper by redelmeier and and they said would this effect also happens to experts people who are well paid they presented to them a case study of a patient they said here is a patient farmer he 's been suffering from right hip pain for a while and they said to the physicians you decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient all these medications nothing seems to be working so you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy hip replacement okay so the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced what do you do do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen or do you let him go and have hip replacement yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn 't try out yet or you pull him back and if you pull him back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam which one i hope this worries you by the way when you go to see your physician the thing is that no physician would ever say piroxicam ibuprofen hip replacement let 's go for hip replacement but the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing i 'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision making imagine i give you a choice do you want to go for a weekend to rome all expenses paid hotel a continental breakfast everything weekend in paris weekend in rome these are different things they have different food different culture different art or having your car stolen laughter it 's a funny idea because why would having your car stolen in this set influence anything but what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this what if it was a trip to rome all expenses paid transportation breakfast but it doesn 't include coffee in the morning if you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself it 's two euros fifty given that you can have rome with coffee why would you possibly want rome without coffee it 's like having your car stolen it 's an inferior option the fact that you have rome without coffee makes rome with coffee look superior and not just to rome without coffee even superior to paris two examples of this principle this was an ad in the economist a few years ago that gave us three choices an online subscription for fifty nine dollars a print subscription for one hundred and twenty five dollars or you could get both for one hundred and twenty five now i looked at this and i called up the economist and i tried to figure out what they were thinking and they passed me from one person to until eventually i got to the person who was in charge of the website and i called them up and they went to check what was going on the next thing i know the ad is gone no explanation i said what would you choose these are the market shares thankfully nobody wanted the dominant option that means our students can read but now if you have an option that nobody wants you can take it off right so i printed another version of this where i eliminated the middle option i gave it to another one hundred students here is what happened now the most popular option became the least popular and the least popular became the most popular what was happening was the option that was useless in the middle was useless in the sense that nobody which was and because we don 't know our preferences that susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces the defaults the particular options that are presented to us and so on one more example of this four minute dates so i decided to do this experiment with people tom i took photoshop and i made jerry slightly less attractive for the other people i added an ugly version of tom and the question was will ugly jerry and ugly tom help their respective tom was popular this of course has two very clear implications for if you ever go bar hopping who do you want to take with you what is the general point the general point is that when we think about economics we have this beautiful view of human nature what a piece of work is a man how noble in reason we have this view of ourselves of others the behavioral economics perspective is slightly less generous to people in fact in medical terms that 's our view laughter but there is a silver lining the silver lining is i think kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and and exciting are we superman or are we homer simpson we build steps and we build these things that not everybody can use obviously we understand our limitations and we build around them but for some reason when it comes to the mental world when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets we somehow forget the idea that we are limited i think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way we understand our physical limitations even though they don 't stare us in the face the same way we could design a better world and that i think is the hope of this thing"
