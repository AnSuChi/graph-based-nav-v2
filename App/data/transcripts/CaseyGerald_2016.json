  "transcript": "there we were souls and bodies packed into a texas church on the last night of our lives packed into a room just like this but with creaky wooden pews draped in with an organ to my left and a choir at my back and a baptism pool built into the wall behind them a room like this nonetheless with the same great feelings of suspense the same deep hopes for salvation the same sweat in the the night of the second coming of christ and the end of the world as i knew it i had turned twelve that year and had reached the age of accountability and once i stopped complaining about how unfair it was that jesus would return as soon as i had to be accountable for all that i had done so i went to church as often as i could i listened for silence i built a backup by reading the left behind books that were all the rage at the time and i found in their pages that if i was not taken in the rapture at midnight i had another shot all i had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast fight off demons plagues and the antichrist himself it would be hard but i knew i could do it but planning time was over now it was eleven we had ten minutes left and my pastor called us out of the pews and down to the altar because he wanted to be praying when midnight struck so every faction of the congregation took its place the choir stayed in the choir stand the deacons and their wives or the baptist bourgeoisie as i like to call them took first position in front of the altar you see in america the second coming of christ has a vip section and right behind the baptist bourgeoisie were the elderly these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of east texas and whose skin seemed to be burnt a and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of east texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs yes these men and women were the stars of the show for me they had waited their whole lives for this moment just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world and just as my grandmother waited for the oprah winfrey show to come on and as she made her way to the altar i snuck right in behind her because i knew for sure and i thought that if i held on to her hand i might go right on with her so i held on and i closed my eyes to listen to wait and the prayers got louder and the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still and the organ rolled on in to add the dirge and the heat came on to add to the sweat and my hand gripped firmer so i wouldn 't be the one left in the field my eyes clenched tighter so i wouldn 't see the wheat being separated from the i looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment who had believed too much and for too long but i was upset and i had gone right along with them i had prayed their prayers i had yielded not to temptation as best i could i had dipped my head not once but twice time to turn on the television and watch peter jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world it struck me that it would have been strange anyway for jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones and this made me feel even more ridiculous i just believed a new thing that it was possible not to believe it where there was once a mountain of certitude there was running right down to its foundation i can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me when the thing i believed most certainly and even though most of you prepared for y2k in a very different way convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that i have done since my mother left and my father stayed away and my lord refused to come and i held out my hand reaching for something to believe in i held on when i arrived at yale at eighteen with the faith that my journey from oak cliff texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges i had known the broken dreams and broken bodies i had seen but with my face planted in the floor my hands tied behind my back and a burglar 's gun pressed to my head i knew that even the best education couldn 't save me i held on when i showed up at lehman brothers as an intern in two thousand and eight so hopeful that i called home to inform my family that we 'd never be poor again i witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes i knew that even the best job couldn 't save me i held on change has come to america but as the congress ground to a halt and the country ripped at the seams and hope and change began to feel like a cruel joke i knew that even the political second coming could not save me i had knelt faithfully at the altar of the american dream praying to the gods of my time and money and i opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead and from that graveyard i began the search once more not because i was brave but because i knew that i would either believe so i took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca harvard business this time knowing that i could not simply accept the salvation that it claimed to offer no i knew there 'd be more work to do the work began in the dark corner in the late night of an early miserable cambridge winter when three friends and i asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time what if we took a road trip we didn 't know where 'd we go or how we 'd get there but we knew we had to do it because all our lives we yearned as jack kerouac wrote to sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country we went on eight thousand miles across america in the summer of two thousand and thirteen through the cow pastures of montana through the desolation of detroit through the swamps of new orleans where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose having been trained at the west point of capitalism this struck us as a revolutionary idea and this idea spread growing into a nonprofit called mbas across america it spread because we found a great hunger in our generation for purpose but if i 'm being honest it also spread because i fought to spread it there was no length to which i would not go to preach this gospel to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country one social business at a time but it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel it began one evening almost a year ago at the museum of natural history in new york city at a gala for alumni of harvard business school under a i sat with the titans of our time there was pride in a room where net worth and we looked over all that we had made and it was good but it just so happened i had to travel up the road to harlem where i listening to a man named tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day all of them many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter some of them came to tony 's program called harlem grown to get the only meal they had each day tony told me that he started he told me that he didn 't give himself a because despite success the program struggled for resources he told me that he would take any help that he could get and i was there but as i left tony i felt the sting and salt of tears i felt the weight of revelation that i could sit in one room on one night where a few hundred people just fifty blocks up the road where a man was going without a salary and it wasn 't the glaring inequality that made me want it wasn 't the thought of hungry homeless kids it wasn 't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the ninety nine no i was disturbed because i had finally realized that i was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant i realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps even if they didn 't have any boots that my organization stood in for all the structural systemic help that never went to harlem or appalachia or the lower 9th ward that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned too unwashed and the shame of that that peter jennings announce the new millennium tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of god and took a text to be infallible truth yes i 've come so far that i 'm right back where i started because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief no we believe today just as much as any time that came but we desperately want to believe we need to believe we speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems we see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god we take the text of progress to be infallible truth and we hardly realize the human price we pay but if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept then it must be questioning time so i have not a gospel i do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today in fact i have and i offer the gospel of doubt does not ask that you stop believing it asks that you believe a new thing that it is possible not to believe it is possible the answers we have are wrong it is possible the questions themselves are wrong yes the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we because it raises the question why with all the power that we hold in our hands why are people still suffering so bad this doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization mbas across america out of business we have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission this doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me because our time it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds it will not be our blind faith no it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply very simply there must be"
