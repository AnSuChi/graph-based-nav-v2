  "transcript": "namely road congestion road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon it exists in basically all of the cities all around the world which is a little bit surprising when you think i mean you have the typical european cities with a dense urban core good public transportation mostly but then on the other hand you have the american cities anyway the american cities lots of roads dispersed over large areas almost no public transportation and then you have the emerging world and traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures but all of these attempts have one thing in common they 're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving they 're essentially to a point attempts at planning what other people should do planning their life for them planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do and let me tell you a story back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine when the berlin wall fell an urban urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying basically who 's in charge of london 's bread supply and the urban planner in london goes no one is in charge oh but surely someone must be in charge i mean it 's a very complicated system someone must control all of this no no one is in charge i mean it basically i haven 't really thought of it it basically organizes itself that 's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of and this is a very deep insight and let 's now look at now stockholm is a roughly two million people but stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges narrow bridges old bridges which means lots of road congestion and then someone came up with the idea that apart from good public transport from spending money on roads i mean compared to parking charges and running costs etc so you would probably expect that car drivers wouldn 't really react to this fairly small charge you would be wrong that 's a fairly huge figure you might think but you 've still got eighty percent left of the problem right because you still have eighty percent of the traffic now that 's also wrong but fortunately if you can reduce traffic even somewhat then congestion will go down now congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on january three two thousand and six and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm one of the typical streets january two the first day with the congestion charges looked like this this is what happens when you take away twenty percent of the cars from the streets reduce congestion quite substantially and we basically have the same low traffic levels the thing is that congestion charges they were introduced first as a trial so they were introduced in january and then abolished again at which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity i mean and we actually got to do it twice so we followed up what happened this is the last day with the congestion charges july thirty one and you see the same street but now it 's summer and summer in stockholm is a very nice and light and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this all the cars were back but i would say that the most surprising slide here i 'm going to show you today is not this one it 's this one and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in meaning that i mean let me think about it this way if we can understand understand this then maybe we can figure out well so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services and tried to figure out who changed and where did they go and it turned out that they don 't know themselves for some reason the car drivers are and why is that it 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think each day people make new who changed their opinion and why and what type of group changed their and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along"
