  "transcript": "was sold for one hundred and five thousand pounds nine times the previous world record 18th century the prince of any wine cellar benjamin wallace now that 's about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest running mystery in the modern wine and the mystery existed because of a gentleman named hardy rodenstock in one thousand nine hundred and eighty five he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery some workmen in paris had broken through a brick wall and happened upon this hidden cache of wines apparently the property of thomas jefferson reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal and he ended up spending over a million dollars agents to and that the jefferson bottles but for those twenty years an unbelievable number of really i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world i became why do people spend these crazy amounts of money not only on wine but on on lots of things and are they living a better life than me so i decided to embark on a quest with the generous backing of a magazine i write i decided to sample the very best or most expensive or most coveted item in about a dozen categories which was a very grueling quest as you can imagine it may come from wagyu cattle but it 's not from the original appalachian hyogo prefecture i went there and i was outraged it and i wished that it was tinier because kobe beef is so rich it 's like foie gras it 's not even like steak i almost couldn 't finish it i was really happy the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them so that 's why you 're going to see this recurring character communicates to you that i did not think that one was really worth the price white truffles one of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world to try this i went to a mario batali restaurant in came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said you know would signore like the truffles and the charm of white truffles is in their aroma it 's not in their taste really it 's not in their texture it 's in the smell these white pearlescent flakes mushroomy smell wafted up ten seconds passed and it was gone and then i was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta there were several several of these items were disappointments the magazine wouldn 't pay for me to go there it comes with its own rolls royce and driver it comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from when i took the tour it actually included some opus one i was glad to see thirty thousand dollars for a night in a hotel this is soap that 's made from silver i washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this but i have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today but then again nobody has complimented me on the jeans i 'm wearing these ones gq did spring for i own these but i will tell you not only did i not get a compliment from any of you i have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months i don 't think that whether or not you 're getting a compliment should be the test of something 's value but i think in the case of a fashion item an article of clothing that 's a reasonable benchmark that said a lot of work goes into these they are made from handpicked organic zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from and he actually once he releases a batch of it he regularly conducts gauge its freshness i did a blind taste it tasted fine it tasted interesting it was very green it was very peppery but blind taste test it came in last the olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of whole foods three hundred and sixty five olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months i don 't play golf so i couldn 't actually road test even the people who market these clubs i mean they 'll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther but they 'll say look you know you 're not getting fifty seven thousand dollars worth of performance from these clubs you 're paying for the bling that they 're encrusted with gold and platinum the guy who i interviewed who owns them did say that he 's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee tract leeches into the beans and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats ' leavings then go through the forest results and processing it into coffee although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form japan is doing crazy things with toilets there is now a toilet that has an mp3 player in it there there 's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor it 's almost like a home medical center and that is the direction that japanese toilet technology is heading in this one does not have those bells and whistles but for pure functionality it 's pretty much the best the neorest six hundred but and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use which i used it 's fully automated you walk towards there 's an air jet that dries you you get up it flushes by itself the lid closes and i want to get one this was another one i could not get a loaner of there 's a little plaque on the end that you know each buyer gets their name engraved on it to try this one the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the manhattan showroom lights glaring in off the street and we had to hire a security guard we had a great night 's sleep and i don 't think it 's that bad of a deal this was a fun one this is the fastest street legal car in the world and the most expensive production car and we drove around the canyons outside of los angeles and down on the pacific coast highway and you know when we pulled up to a stoplight this chaperone said you know you were just going one hundred and ten miles an hour and i had no idea that i was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic because it was just that smooth and if i was a billionaire i would get one this is tom cruise arriving at the and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape and a legendary vintage especially in the right bank of bordeaux and just together that vintage and that chateau there 's not much of it left what there is of it left you don 't know if it 's real it 's considered to be the most faked wine in the world not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist 'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these bipin desai is a u c riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings and he said i 've got a tasting coming up where we 're going to serve the ' forty seven cheval blanc and it was going to be a double vertical it was going to be thirty vintages of cheval blanc and thirty vintages of yquem and it was i went it was three days four meals and at lunch on saturday we opened the ' forty seven and you know it had this fragrant softness and it smelled a little bit of porty richness which is characteristic of that wine that it sort of resembles port you know fantastic there were some people who were and and i don 't but i was not the only and it wasn 't just to that wine any one of the wines served at this tasting if i 'd been served it at a dinner party it would have been you know the wine experience of my lifetime and incredibly memorable but drinking sixty great wines over three days they all just blurred together and it became almost a a grueling experience just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year and they gave subjects the same wine labeled with different price tags said that they liked the more expensive wine more it was the same wine but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive but what was unexpected was that these researchers did mri brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag"
