  "transcript": "this afternoon is something a little different than what 's scheduled foreign policy you can figure that out by watching i don 't know rachel maddow or somebody but i want to talk about young people and structure young people and structure was last wednesday afternoon and i was talking to this group of students and take a look at them you 'll notice that the building is rather austere it 's an old new york school building nothing fancy they still have old blackboards and whatnot and they 're about to graduate their first class and that and it was put up on my facebook page last week and somebody wrote in huh why does he have him standing at attention like that and then they said but he looks good because kids need structure and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids i then invite them to ask questions and when they raise their hands i say come up and i make them come up and stand in front of me look up open your eyes stare straight ahead and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear no slouching no pants hanging down none of that and this young man his name is his last name cruz he loved it that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral so people think i 'm being unkind to this kid no we 're having a little fun and the thing about it i 've done this for years the younger they are the more fun it is and so i play a little game with them before i it 's called ' at ease ' it means everybody be quiet and pay attention listen up do you understand i don 't think so i worked with young kids teenagers with guns i call them and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure put them in ranks cut all their hair off so they look alike we teach them how to go right face left face so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions it gives them structure and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately the drill sergeant and they hate him but then the most amazing thing happens over time once they understand mama ain 't here son i 'm your worst i 'm your daddy and your mommy and that 's just the way it is you got that son yeah and then when i ask you a question there are only three possible answers yes sir no sir and no excuse sir don 't start telling me why you didn 't do something it 's yes sir no sir no excuse sir you 're learning fast but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure in and you know what they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant they come to respect him and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children i spend a lot of time with youth let 's fix the schools let 's do more for our teachers let 's put more computers in our schools let 's get it all online but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with when does the learning process begin does it begin in first grade no no it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms looks up at the mother and says oh this must be my mother she 's the one who feeds me oh yeah when i don 't feel so good down there she takes care of me it but by three months and we 're going to read to you a child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school a child who doesn 't know his or her colors or doesn 't know how to tell time doesn 't know how to tie shoes doesn 't know how to do those things and doesn 't know how to do something that mind what you 're saying and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're much to the distress of my my children they are acting just like we did you know you imprint them and that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school and i 'm working at all the energy i have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool we need head start we need prenatal care the education process begins even before the and if you don 't do that you 're going to have difficulty and we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools and then they realize they 're not like the other first graders who read to can do their alphabet and by the third grade the kids who didn 't have that structure and minding in the beginning they act it out and they 're on their way to jail you are a candidate for and we have the highest incarceration rate because we 're not getting our kids the proper start in life the last chapter in my book is called the gift of a good start the and i didn 't do i wanted it when i was writing my first book i wanted to see if my memory was correct and my god it was and then i started out in engineering and that only lasted six months and then i went into geology rocks for jocks this is easy and and i say to young kids man you got it that 's what 's going on and that 's what i found now the authorities at ccny were getting tired of me being there i 'd been there four and a half going on five years and my grades were not and so they said but he does so well in rotc look he gets straight a 's in that but not else and so they said let 's take his rotc grades and roll them into his overall gpa and see what happens and they did and it brought me up to two point and lo and behold many years later i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had so it 's what you do with life and you are blessed to be living in a country that no matter where you start you have opportunities and you believe but it begins with the gift of a good start if we that gift to each and every one of our kids if we don 't invest we 're going to be running into difficulties it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly twenty five percent overall and because they 're not getting the gift of a good start my gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family a good family but having a family that said to me we came to this country in banana boats in one thousand nine hundred and twenty and one thousand nine hundred and twenty four we worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day we 're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose and don 't even think about dropping out if i had ever gone home but they had more than just expectations for us they stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame don 't you shame this family and my parents were coming home and i was in my room waiting ' shame the family ' bit again and i also had this extended network children need a network children need to be part of a tribe a family they never left i so help me god i grew up walking those streets and they were always there and they didn 't care whether you became and they never expected any generals in the family as long as you got an education and then you got a job don 't give us that 's the role of you guys and so it 's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families all families and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren it 's not enough you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr cruz who can make it if you invest in boys and girls clubs if you work with your school system make sure it 's the best school system and not just your kid 's school but the school uptown in harlem not just downtown montessori on the west side all of us we 're going to be a country in one more generation and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours a country that is like no other that 's how the system 's supposed to work it 's a country of such contrasts but it 's a nation of nations we touch every nation every nation touches us we are a nation of immigrants that 's why we need sound 's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty one of the great stories i love to tell is about my but i always have to do is stop at one of the corners gotta have a dirty water dog and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing i 've got to do that i even did it when i was secretary of state i 'd come out of my suite at the waldorf astoria be walking up the street and i would hit around street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler in those days i had five bodyguards around me and three new york city police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while i was going up park avenue and i would order the hot dog from the guy and he 'd start to fix it and then he 'd look around at the bodyguards and the police cars i 've got a green card i 've got a green card but i gotta have my hot dog i did it just last week it was on a tuesday evening and the scene repeats itself so often i 'll go up and and the guy will fix it and as he 's finishing he 'll say i know you i see you on television thank you i and it washes over me my god it 's the same country that greeted my parents this way ninety years ago so we are still that magnificent country but we are fueled by young people coming up from and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours thank you very much"
