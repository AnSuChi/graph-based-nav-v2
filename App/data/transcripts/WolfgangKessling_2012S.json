  "transcript": "but when qatar will host the football world cup ten years from now we already heard it will be in the hot very hot and sunny and when qatar has been assigned to the world cup all many people around the world have been wondering how would it be possible that football players show spectacular football how would it be possible that spectators sit enjoy themselves & partner our engineers from transsolar have been supporting have been developing open air stadia based on one hundred percent solar power on one hundred solar cooling let me tell you about that but let me start with comfort let me start with the aspect of comfort because many people are confusing c it 's actually air temperature is not let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football world cups olympic games around the world looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort and let me start with mexico mexico temperature has been air temperature has been something between fifteen up to thirty degrees c and people enjoyed themselves it was a very comfortable game people have been sitting in the strong sun in the very high humidity in the afternoon and they did not enjoy it was not comfortable the air temperature was not too high but it was not during these games what about and we know that from spain we know that and you get a ticket for the shade you pay more it 's again sun in the day and high humidity and it was not comfortable so if i overlay and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes what we see is in all these places air temperature has been ranging something from to thirty five and if you go on the line thirty of thirty degrees c ambient temperatures if you go along that line you see so why is that this is which is the radiant temperature of the surroundings where we are in and this is air temperature all these parameters go into the comfort feeling of our human body and scientists have developed a parameter which is the perceived temperature where all these parameters go in and help designers to understand which is the driving parameter that i feel comfort or that i don 't feel comfort which is the driving parameter which gives me a perceived climatic parameters are related we produce heat i 'm excited i 'm talking to you i 'm probably producing one hundred and fifty watts at the moment you are sitting you are relaxed you 're looking at me it 's probably one hundred watts each person is producing and we need to get rid of that energy i need with my body to get rid of the energy and the harder it is for myself for my body to get rid of the energy the less comfort i feel that 's it and if i don 't get rid of the energy if we overlay what happens during the football world cup what will happen in june july we will see it 's probably the same comfort rating we 've found in other places which has perceived as which is perceived with a temperature of but what does it mean if we won 't get much better it 's shading it needs to protect where the people are sitting against strong but that 's not all what we need to do we need to we can use radiant cooling technologies like a floor heating system where water pipes are embedded in the floor and just by using cold water going through the water pipes you can release the heat which is absorbed during the day in the stadium so you can create that comfort and then by adding dry air instead of down chilled air the spectators and the football players can adjust to their individual comfort needs to their individual energy balance they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find then using the grass but even the best passive and how do we do that our idea for the bid was one hundred percent solar cooling based on the idea that we use the roof of the stadia we cover the roofs of the stadia with pv we are not using fossil energies we are not borrowing energy from our neighbors we 're using energy we can harvest on our roofs and also on the training pitches which will be covered with flexible membranes and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics giving the possibilities of shading against strong sent into the grid is replacing fossils in the grid and when i need it for the i take it back from the grid and i use the solar energy which i have brought to the grid back when i need it for the and i can do that in the first year and i can balance that in the next ten and the next twenty years which is necessary to condition a world cup in qatar the next twenty years this energy goes into the grid of qatar so this thank you very much we can use that also which is in the united emirates abu dhabi and i i had the pleasure to work on the central plaza and the same idea to use there to create outdoor conditions which are perceived as comfortable people enjoy going there instead and they can and use so i 'd like to encourage you to pay attention to your thermal comfort to your we uploaded a very simple perceived temperature calculator where you can check out about your outdoor comfort and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun"
