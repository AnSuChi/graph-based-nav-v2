  "transcript": "so i imagine you all know something about aids we would decrease aids using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain be faithful and use condoms the abc campaign they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s from about fifteen percent to six percent over a few years and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate uganda and use behavior change to encourage people and i 'm actually also going to challenge some of these things that you you think that you do know to do that i 'm going to talk about my research as an economist on the epidemic and i 'm not really going to talk much about the economy i 'm not going to tell you about exports and prices so we think first and foremost aids is a policy issue and probably for most people in this room that 's how you think about it but this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic it 's going to be about thinking about how it evolves and how people respond to it i think it may seem like i 'm ignoring the policy stuff which is really the most important and the first thing that i want to talk about the first thing i think we need to so so this means that in a place with a lot of aids there 's a really significant cost of sex if you 're an uninfected man living in botswana where the hiv rate is thirty percent if you have one more partner this year a long term partner girlfriend mistress your chance and in fact among gay men in the us we did see that kind of change in the 1980s so if we look in this particularly high risk sample they 're being asked did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months over a period from ' eighty four to ' eighty eight that share drops from about eighty five percent to fifty five percent huge change in a very short period of time but you can see here the share of single men having pre marital sex or married men having extra marital sex and how that changes from the early ' 90s to late ' 90s and late ' 90s to early 2000s the epidemic is getting worse people are learning more things about it we see almost no change in sexual behavior these are just tiny decreases two percentage points not significant so if you 're a software engineer and you 're trying to think about whether to add some new functionality to your program it 's important to think about how much it costs it 's also important to think about what the benefit is and one part of that benefit is how much longer you think this program is going to be active if version ten is coming out next there 's no point in adding more functionality into version nine every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies that 's a costly investment in your health but how much you want to invest is going to depend on how much longer you expect to live in the future even if you don 't make those investments it 's costly to avoid aids people really like to have sex but life expectancy in africa even without aids is really really low forty or fifty years in a lot of places i think it 's possible if we think about that intuition and think about that fact that maybe that explains some of this this low behavior change but we really need to test that and a great way to test that is to look across areas in africa and see so malaria is a disease that kills you it 's a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa in addition to a lot of children so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in so that 's what this figure shows you this shows you in areas with low malaria medium malaria high malaria what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase hiv prevalence if you look at the blue line the areas with low levels of malaria you can see in those areas actually the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot as prevalence goes up areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some it doesn 't decrease as much and areas with high levels of malaria actually it 's increasing a little bit although that 's not significant so by itself i think this tells a lot about how people in combating poor indoor air quality in improving maternal mortality education campaigns like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding may not be enough at least not alone if people have no incentive to avoid aids on their own even if they know everything about the disease they still may not change their behavior so the other thing that i think we learn here is that that aids is not going to fix itself people aren 't changing their behavior enough to decrease the growth in and a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past the reason that we know that that the abc campaign was effective in uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time in uganda we see the prevalence went down we know they had this campaign that 's how we learn about what works it 's not the only place we had any interventions so why don 't we look at those places and see see what happened to their prevalence unfortunately there 's almost no good data on hiv so if i asked you why don and you find actually the only people tested in burkina faso in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one are std patients and pregnant women which is not a terribly representative group of people poked a little more you looked a little more at what was going on you 'd find that actually but even worse some years it 's only iv drug users some years it 's only pregnant women we have no way to figure out what happened over time we have no consistent testing now in the last few years we actually have done some good testing but this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge so but i can 't tell you anything about one thousand nine hundred and ninety three or one thousand nine hundred and eighty three and i started thinking about and i think that the answer is we can look at mortality data and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past to do this we 're going to have to rely on the fact that aids is a very specific kind of disease it kills people in the prime of their lives not a lot of other diseases have that that profile and you can see here this is a graph of death rates by age in botswana and egypt egypt is a place without a lot of aids and you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people that suggests it 's pretty similar levels of development but in this middle region between twenty and the death rates in botswana are much much much higher than in egypt but since there are very few other diseases that kill people we can really attribute that mortality to hiv but because people who died this year of aids got it a few years ago we can use this data on mortality to figure out so it turns out if you use this technique actually your estimates of prevalence are very close to what so this is a graph of prevalence estimated by unaids and prevalence unaids estimates are much us that the hiv rate in zambia is twenty percent and mortality estimates suggest it 's only about five percent and these are not trivial differences in in mortality rates so this is another way to see this you can see that for the prevalence to be as high as unaids says we have to really see sixty deaths per ten thousand rather than twenty deaths per ten thousand in this age group i 'm going to talk a little bit in in a minute about how we but this also tells us that one of these facts that i mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right if you unaids numbers are are much too high maybe that that 's more like ten or fifteen million it doesn 't mean that aids isn 't a problem but it does suggest that that number might be might be a little big and i said in the beginning i wasn 't going to tell you about exports when i started working on these projects i was not thinking at all about economics but eventually it kind of sucks you back in so i am going to talk about exports and prices and hiv but openness and inter connectedness it comes with a cost when we think about disease and i wouldn 't be at all worried about that if we never the epidemic was introduced to the us by actually one male steward on an airline flight who got the disease in africa and brought it back and that was the genesis of the entire epidemic epidemiologists have noted for a long time that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than than other people areas with a lot of economic activity with a lot of but that actually doesn 't mean at all that that if we gave people more more exports more trade that that would increase prevalence by using this new data using this information about prevalence over time we can actually test that and so it seems to be so the data that i have so this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy from a forecasting perspective if we know where trade is likely to change for example because of the african growth and opportunities act or other policies that encourage trade we can actually think about which areas are are likely to be heavily infected with hiv and we can go and we can we can try to have but it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know even though it is the case that poverty is linked to aids in the sense that africa is poor and they have a lot of aids 's not necessarily the case that improving improving poverty at least in the short run that improving exports and improving development it 's not necessarily the case that that 's going to lead to a decline in hiv prevalence so throughout this talk i 've mentioned a few times the special case of uganda and the fact that it 's the only country in sub saharan africa with successful prevention it 's been widely but now i want to actually also also question that but there was actually something else that happened in uganda in this period there was a big decline in 1990s and actually that decline lines up really really closely with this decline in about before it suggests that somewhere between but that 's enormously important for policy we 're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign and if it was only fifty percent as effective as we we think that it was then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted and maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things and i hope that i 've convinced you maybe that it 's to think about policy"
