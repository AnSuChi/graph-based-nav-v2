  "transcript": "i am honored to be here and i 'm honored to talk about this topic which i think is of grave importance we 've been talking a lot about the but plastic hurts people too and both in the production of plastic the use of plastic and the disposal of plastic the people who have the bull 's eye on their foreheads are poor people people got very upset when the bp oil spill happened for very good reason people thought in the water it 's going to destroy the the living systems there people are going to be hurt this is a terrible thing this oil is going to hurt the people in the gulf what people don 't think about is what if the oil had made it safely to shore what if the oil actually got where it was trying to go not only would it have been burned in engines and added to global warming but there 's a place called alley it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem when there 's a spill they 're a problem when there 's not and what we don 't often appreciate is the price that poor people pay for us to have these disposable products the other thing we often don 't appreciate is it 's not just at the point of production that poor people suffer poor people also suffer at the point of use those of us who earn a certain income level we have something called choice the reason why you want to work hard and have a job and not be poor and broke is so you can have choices economic choices we actually get a chance to choose not to use so low income people often are the ones who are buying the products that they should just and if that weren 't bad enough if it wasn 't just the production of plastic that 's giving people cancer in places like cancer alley and shortening lives and hurting poor kids at the point of use at the point of disposal once again it 's poor people who bear the burden i 'm going to put it in the blue bin but if we were to be able to follow that little bottle we would be shocked to discover that all too often that bottle is going to be put on a boat it 's going to go all the way across the ocean and it 's going to wind up in a developing country often china we 're so happy to see you little bottle that bottle the recycling of plastic in many developing countries and so poor people who are making these products in petrochemical centers like cancer alley poor people who are consuming these products disproportionately and then poor people who even at the at the tail end of the recycling are having their lives shortened they 're all being harmed greatly by this addiction that we have to disposability now you think to yourself i know how you are you say that sure is terrible for those poor people it 's just awful those those poor people i hope someone does something to help them but what we don 't understand is almost all of the clean air gains and the toxic air gains that we 've achieved here in california have been wiped out by dirty air coming over from asia so we all are being hit we all are being impacted it 's just that the poor people get it first and worst the lack of environmental standards in asia is actually creating so much dirty we 're back where we were in and so we 're on one planet and we have to be able to get to the root of these problems the root of this problem in my view you see if you understand the link between what we 're doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we 're doing to poor arrive at a very troubling but also very helpful insight but if you create a world where you don 't trash people you can 't trash the planet so now we are at a moment where the coming together of social justice as an idea and ecology as an idea we finally can now see that they are the day one idea and it 's the idea that we don 't have disposable anything we don 't have disposable resources we don 't have disposable and we don 't have disposable people either we don 't have a throwaway planet and we don 't have throwaway children it 's all precious and as we all begin to come back to that basic understanding new opportunities for action begin to emerge it turns out we 're a pretty clever species we have this big i 'm going to get poison and pollute but i got this hard thing i 'm so clever and you look behind you and there 's destruction all around you but guess what as clever as a clam a clamshell is hard there 's no vacuums there 's no big furnaces there 's no poison there 's no pollution it turns out that other species figured out a long time ago that insight of biomimicry of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species i don 't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff abusing the little species i mean actually respecting them respecting what they 've achieved and that opens the door to zero waste production zero pollution production that we could actually without trashing the planet that idea combined with the idea of democracy and social justice respecting the wisdom and the worth of all people we would have a green society that dr king and the way that we get there is to first of all recognize that the idea of disposability not only hurts we just had this vote california has one of the highest incarceration rates of all the fifty states we have a moral challenge in this movement we are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing one of every four people locked up anywhere in the world is locked up right here in the united states so that is consistent with this idea that disposability is something we believe in and yet as a movement that has to broaden its constituency and they ask a question and the question is how can these people be so passionate somebody might say to themselves and rightfully so how can these people be so passionate about making sure that a plastic bottle and yet when my child gets in trouble and no throwaway dead materials and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like cancer alley and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement when we take on topics like this it gives us that extra call to reach out and we can finally get out of this crazy dilemma that we 've been in most of you are good softhearted people pick an issue you had to boil your love down to an issue can 't love the whole world you 've got to work on trees or you 've got to work on immigration they fundamentally told you pick are you going to hug a tree or are you going to hug a child pick well when you start working on issues like plastic you realize the whole thing is connected thank you very much"
