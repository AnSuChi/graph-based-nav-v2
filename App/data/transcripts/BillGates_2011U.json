  "transcript": "but i want to tell you i think it 's an important topic that we need to care about state budgets are big big money many of the people involved have special interests or short term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are and these budgets are the key for our future they 're the key for our kids most education funding whether it 's k through twelve or the great universities or community colleges most of the money for those things but we have a problem which is the largest the state level and the local level and it 's really in this combined way that you get an overall sense of what 's going on because there 's a lot of complex things like medicaid and research money that flow across those boundaries now this leaves ten percent deficit sort of a mind blowing number but most not because of that most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends and that creates a a huge challenge in fact this is the forecast picture there are various things in here i could say we might raise more revenue or medical innovation will make the spending even higher it is an increasingly difficult picture even assuming the economy does quite well probably better than now how did we get here how could you have a problem like this only one state but what this means actually is that there 's a pretense there 's no real true balancing going on and in a sense the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people don 't see things that are actually pretty straight forward challenges when jerry brown was elected this was the challenge that was put to him that is through various now he 's put together some thoughts about half of that but even so as you go out into those future years various pension costs health costs go up enough and the revenue does not go up enough so you get a big squeeze it perpetuates deficit spending it really when you get down to it the guys at enron never would have done this this is so blatant so extreme is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do they borrow money they 're not supposed to but they figure out a way they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out they sell off the assets they defer the payments and california 's not unique in fact there 's about five states that are worse and only really four states that don 't face this big challenge so it 's systemic across the entire country it really comes from the fact that certain long term obligations health care where innovation makes it more expensive early retirement and pension where the age structure gets worse for you and just mis accounting things allow to develop over time that you 've got a problem the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from twenty six percent of the budget if you don 't change that revenue picture if you don 't solve what you 're doing in health care you 're going to be deinvesting the great university of california university system the great within the education community there 's this discussion of should it just be the young teachers who get laid off or the less good teachers where do you do that how much effect does that have there 's ways if it 's temporary to minimize the impact it 's also really a problem for where we need to go technology has a role to play well we need money to experiment with that to get those those tools in there there 's the idea of paying teachers for measuring them giving them feedback taking videos in the classroom that 's something i think is very very important well you have to allocate dollars for that system and for that incentive pay in a situation where you have growth you put the new money into this or even if you 're flat you might shift money into it but with the type of cuts we 're talking about it will be far far harder to get these incentives for excellence to move over where 's the brain trust well there really is no brain trust laughter it 's sort of the voters it 's sort of us showing up just look at this spending california will spend over one hundred billion analysis both inside google and microsoft and outside with analysts and people of various opinions should they have spent on that no they wasted their money on this what about this thing it really is quite phenomenal everybody has an opinion there 's great feedback and the numbers are used to make decisions if you go over the education spending and the health care spending particularly these trends you don 't have that type of involvement on a number that 's more important in terms of equity in terms of learning so what do we need to do we need better tools we can get some things out on the internet i 'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture we need lots more there 's a few good books one about school spending and where the money comes from how that changed over time and the challenge we need better accounting we need to take the fact that the current employees the future liabilities they create that should come out of the current budget and finally we need to really reward politicians whenever they say there 's these oh you 're the messenger with bad news we just shot you in fact there are some like these erskine bowles alan simpson and others who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal but in fact their work was sort of pushed off in fact the week afterwards some tax cuts were done that that made the situation even worse now i think this is a solvable problem it 's a great country with lots of people but we have to draw those people in because this is about education and just look at what happened with the tuitions with the university of california and project that 's the kind of thing the investment in the young the biotechnology the software and all those those magic things and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they 're critical for our kids and our future"
