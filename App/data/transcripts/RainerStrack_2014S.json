  "transcript": "and i 'm turning fifty in one month that means i was born in one thousand in a small town in germany as a matter of fact one thousand nine hundred and sixty four was the year with the highest birth rate ever in germany more than one point three million last year we just hit over six hundred thousand so half of my number what you can see here is the german age pyramid and there the small black point at the top that 's me so people over fifteen and under let 's do a simple simulation and i with many other baby boomers will retire in two thousand and thirty the red area so the potential working age population in two thousand and thirty except for much higher migration rates and if you compare this red area in two thousand and thirty so before i show you the rest of the world what does this so what we know from this picture is as you might know the consultant 's favorite answer to any question is it depends so i would say it depends if germany wants to continue this gdp and productivity growth so germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly and the picture always looked like this germany has to significantly increase migration get many more women in the workforce increase retirement age by the way we just lowered it this year and all these measures at once if germany fails here and companies will look for talents somewhere we simulated labor supply and and labor demand for the largest fifteen economies in the world blue indicates a labor surplus and gray are those so by two thousand and twenty we still see a labor surplus in some countries like italy france the u s we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies including three out of the four bric countries will be hit as well as brazil to tell the truth the situation will be even more challenging and what we found and this means huge challenges in terms of education now the next thing we looked into was robots automation technology will technology change this picture and boost productivity now the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology a long answer would go like this let 's take germany the germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity and when i left an old senior partner told me literally send me more of these germans they work like machines not only in the production industry but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots artificial intelligence big data so the key question is not will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis yes and no this is a more sophisticated version of it let 's take because there more than forty percent of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place in less than ten percent of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts today this number is more than thirty percent and it will grow to more than fifty and these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs like the cognitive systems engineer who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system in one thousand nine hundred no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon and that means so talents will be the big thing in the next decade we have to understand them much better what are their job preferences to find out this year we conducted a global survey among more than two hundred thousand job seekers from one hundred and eighty nine countries migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap at least in the short term asked about mobility more than sixty percent of these two hundred thousand job seekers are willing to work abroad for me a surprisingly high number if you split this number up by country the least mobile countries are russia germany and the u s now where would these people like to move number seven is australia where twenty eight percent could imagine moving then france of these two hundred thousand people so what are they looking for out of a list of twenty six topics salary is only number eight having a great relationship with the boss three relationship with colleagues and the top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work so do i get a thank you our global workforce crisis becomes very personal people plus a big cultural challenge and this global workforce crisis is approaching very so what can we what can governments what can companies do and such a people strategy consists of four parts number one a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills workforce planning will become more important than financial planning women but also retirees three a plan for how to educate and there 's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us or in other words how to realize an appreciation however one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes thank you"
