  "transcript": "and mourners to and fro kept treading treading till [ it seemed ] that sense was breaking through and when they all were seated service like a drum kept beating beating till i [ thought ] my mind was going numb then space began to toll as [ all ] the heavens were a bell and finished knowing then we know depression through metaphors goya in an image half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states as for me i had always thought myself tough one of the people who could survive if i 'd been sent to a concentration camp in one thousand nine hundred and ninety one i had a series of losses my i found myself losing interest in almost everything the opposite of and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment everything there was to do seemed like too much work and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends i would think what a lot of people that is to have to call back i would decide i should have lunch and then i would think but i 'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it you know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it and so i began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and then the anxiety set in if you i would say as long i know it 'll be over in november i can do it but if you said to me you have to have acute anxiety for the next month i would rather slit my wrist than go through it it was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you 're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you but instead of lasting half a second the way that does it lasted for six months it 's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you 're afraid of and it was at that point that i began to think that it was just too painful to be alive and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people and finally looking at the telephone thinking something is wrong and i should call for help and somehow i managed to pick it up i 'm in serious trouble we need to do something the next day and i also started reckoning with this terrible question and if i have to take medication is that medication making me more fully myself or is it making me someone else else and how do i feel about it i had two advantages as i went into the fight there was something at the other end that was worth living for and the other was that i had access to good treatment but i nonetheless emerged and relapsed and emerged and finally understood and then i understood that actually we aren 't advanced and i also figured out but i am so grateful that i live now and not fifty years ago when there would have been almost nothing to be done i hope that fifty years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science depression is the flaw flaw in love if my wife dies i 'll find another one there 's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss there are three things people tend to grief is explicitly reactive it 's probably grief and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel the trajectory tells us a great deal it 's much much too much sadness much too much grief at far too slight a cause as i set out to understand depression i found that there were people who seemed on the surface to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it and i set out to find one of the first people i interviewed described depression as a slower way of being and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness that this is a serious business it 's the leading disability worldwide and people die of it every day and then plummeted into a horrific and she had another and then plunged into the worst depression that i had ever seen in which she sat in her parents ' apartment and when i interviewed her about that experience some years later she 's a poet and psychotherapist named maggie robbins when i interviewed her she said ' where have all the flowers gone ' over and over to occupy my mind i was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying which were ' you are nothing you are nobody you don 't even deserve to live ' and that was when i really started thinking about killing myself you don 't think in depression that you 've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood and that now you 're seeing truly but the truth lies i became obsessed with that sentence but the truth lies and i discovered as i talked to depressive people that they have many delusional perceptions people will say no one loves me and you say i love you your wife loves you your mother loves you you can answer that one pretty readily at least for most people but people who are depressed will also say no matter what we do we 're all just going to die in the end or they 'll say there can be no true communion between two human beings each of us is trapped in his own body to which you have to say but i think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast a lot of the time and one comes to think what 's really extraordinary is that most of us know about those existential questions and they don 't distract us very much there was a study i particularly liked in which a group of depressed and a group of and the non depressed people guessed between fifteen and twenty times as many little monsters as they had actually a lot of people said when i chose to write about my depression that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet to have people know they said do people talk to you differently or their sister 's experience or their friend 's experience know my husband would never understand this he 's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn 't make any sense so you know it 's just between us and i said yes that 's fine on sunday of the same conference her husband took me aside and he said my wife wouldn 't think that i was really much of a guy if she knew this but i 've been dealing with this depression and i 'm taking some medication wondered what you think they were hiding the same medication in two different places in the same bedroom laughter and i said that i thought communication within the marriage might be triggering some of their problems but i was also struck by the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy depression is so exhausting and then i began thinking about all the ways people make themselves better i thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked it was clear what they were there was medication there were certain psychotherapies there was possibly electroconvulsive treatment and that everything else was nonsense but then i discovered something but if you say that you have depression and standing on your head for twenty minutes every day makes you feel better then you are effectively not depressed anymore so i became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments and i get letters i get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what 's worked for them someone was asking me backstage today about meditation my favorite of the letters that i got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything and she had found a solution and hoped i would tell the world and that was making little things from yarn she sent me some of them laughter and i 'm not wearing them right now i suggested to her that she also should look up obsessive compulsive disorder and yet when i to look at alternative treatments i also gained perspective on other treatments i went through a tribal exorcism in senegal that involved a great deal of ram 's blood and that i 'm not going to detail right now and i happened to describe my experience to someone and he said well that 's west africa and we 're in east africa and our rituals are in some ways very different but we do have some and he said but we 've had a lot of trouble with western mental health workers especially the ones who came right after the genocide i said what kind of trouble did you have and he said well they they didn 't include drumming or music to get people 's blood going they didn 't involve the whole community they 't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them the worst depression perhaps that i 've ever seen then he would and i 've figured out how i 'm going to end it if i don 't get better but he said to me i heard about a protocol at mass general for a procedure called a cingulotomy which is a brain surgery and i think i 'm going to give that a try and i remember being amazed at that point to think that someone who clearly had so many bad experiences with so and he said my father sent me two presents this year first a motorized cd rack from the sharper image but i knew he was giving it to me to celebrate the fact that i 'm living on my own and have a job i seem to love and my mother came over and said ' are you crying because of the relatives you never knew ' and i said ' she had the same disease i have i 'm alive and grateful even if it doesn 't always and i went to look at how it operated in a variety of and so i went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression and what i discovered is that poor people are mostly not being treated for depression depression is the result of a genetic vulnerability and yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time you think why do i feel like this i must have depression and it doesn 't occur to you to think maybe this is treatable and so we have an epidemic and she was a woman by the way i used to have a job but i had to give it up because i couldn 't go out of the house i can 't wait for them to leave and three o 'clock when they come home it just comes so fast she said i 've been taking a lot of tylenol anything i can take working in childcare and she said to me my kids are so much happier now they 're just all up on my bed and we 're doing homework all together and and one of the girls says she 's going to be a lawyer they don 't cry like they used to and they don 't fight like they did that 's all i need now is my kids things keep on changing and i don 't think those bad feelings are coming back and if it weren 't for dr miranda and that i would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head if i were still alive at all and he heard my prayers i was really moved by these experiences and my editor called me and said we really can 't publish this and i said why not and she said it just is too far fetched these people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and they 're virtually ready to run morgan stanley it 's just too implausible of anything like it and i said the fact that you 've never heard of it is an indication that it is news and you are a news magazine but i think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way to this distaste that would be exploitative because we would be changing and that it 's not it would be natural for people 's teeth to fall out but there is nobody militating against toothpaste at least not in my circles mood is adaptive being able to have sadness and fear and joy and pleasure and all it 's maladaptive i think i can just get through this and that 's a whole year you 're talking about giving up think it through people say to me well is it but it 's the same way there 's continuity between having an iron fence outside your house that gets a little rust spot and it 's that orange dust spot that orange dust setting out to address so now people say you take these happy pills and do you feel happy and i don 't and i don 't feel sad about taking a shower i feel about damaged relationships about global warming and i said to myself well what is the conclusion how did those people who have better lives even with bigger depression manage to get through and what i came up with over time was that the people who those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have while you hide from it it and the people who do better are are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have have this condition those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience so frank russakoff said to me if i had a do over i suppose i wouldn 't do it this but in a strange way i 'm grateful for what i 've experienced i 'm glad to have been in the hospital forty times it taught me so much about love and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me and will be always used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk and the people i was dealing with weren 't very responsive and i thought ' that 's not very friendly or helpful of them ' and then i realized i realized that they weren 't going to do more than make those first few minutes of small talk it was simply going to be an occasion where i didn 't have aids and i wasn 't dying could tolerate the fact that they did and they were our needs are our greatest assets it turns out i 've learned to give all the things i need but it may make the prospect of relapse and even relapse itself easier to tolerate but i will learn something from it i have learned in my own depression how big an emotion can be how it can be more real have discovered something inside of myself that i would have to call a soul i think that while i hated being depressed and would hate to be depressed again and sometimes against the moment 's reason to cleave to the reasons for living thank you"
