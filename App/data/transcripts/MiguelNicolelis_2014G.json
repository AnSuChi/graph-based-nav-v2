  "transcript": "on june twelve two thousand and fourteen precisely at three in a balmy winter afternoon in so paulo brazil a typical south american winter juliano pinto twenty nine years old a magnificent deed despite being paralyzed and not having any sensation from to the tip of his toes as the result of a car crash six years ago that killed his brother in a wheelchair juliano rose to the occasion and on this day did something that pretty much everybody that saw him in the six years deemed impossible juliano pinto delivered the opening kick of the two thousand and fourteen brazilian world soccer cup here but he could imagine the movements needed to kick a ball he was an athlete before the lesion right now he 's going to be in the paralympic games i hope in a couple years but what the spinal cord lesion did not rob from juliano was his ability to dream and dream he did that afternoon for a stadium of about seventy five thousand people and an audience of close to a billion and that kick crowned basically thirty years of basic research studying how the brain how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about one hundred billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms what juliano accomplished took thirty years to imagine in laboratories and about fifteen years to plan when john chapin and i fifteen years ago proposed in a paper that we would connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices no matter how far they are from their own bodies just by imagining what they want to do our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help and despite that a scot because that 's how we were raised in our respective countries and for twelve fifteen years we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible and a brain machine interface is not rocket science it 's just brain research it 's nothing but using sensors to read the electrical brainstorms that a brain is producing to generate the motor commands that have to be downloaded to the spinal cord so we and extract from these electrical signals and by doing that we converted these signals into digital commands that any mechanical electronic or even a virtual device can understand so that the subject can imagine what he she or it wants to make move and the device obeys that brain command by sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors as you are going to see in a moment we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted no matter where next to the subject next door learned to control the movements of an avatar arm a virtual arm that doesn what you 're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey and to get a reward a drop of orange juice that monkeys love this animal has to detect select one of these objects by touching not by seeing it by touching it because every time this virtual hand touches one of the objects an and if he does that he gets a reward we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published fifteen years ago we reenacted this paper we got it out of the drawers let me tell you it 's very sudden it 's a millisecond of a car accident that transforms your life completely so what we proposed was let 's create a new body because he was wearing the first brain controlled robotic vest that can be used by paraplegic quadriplegic patients to move and to regain feedback because a couple years after brazil was awarded the world cup we heard that the brazilian government wanted to do something meaningful in the opening ceremony in the country that reinvented and perfected soccer until we met the germans of course but and a different neuroscientist needs to talk about that a country that values science and technology and can give a gift million people around the world that cannot move any longer because of a spinal cord injury well we went to the brazilian government and to fifa and proposed well let 's have the kickoff of the two thousand and fourteen world cup be given by a brazilian paraplegic using a brain controlled exoskeleton that allows and said we had nothing done these people came all together and in eighteen months we got eight patients in a routine of training alberto santos dumont who on october nineteen one created and flew himself the first controlled airship on air in paris for a million people to see sorry my american but it was two years before the wright brothers flew on the coast of north carolina applause flight control is brazilian so we went together with these guys and we basically put this exoskeleton together fifteen degrees of freedom non invasive technology called electroencephalography that can basically allow the patient to imagine the movements and send his commands to the controls the motors and get it done this exoskeleton was covered with an artificial skin invented by gordon cheng one of my greatest friends in munich to a shirt it is a smart shirt and he takes a few seconds because we are setting everything and you are going to see a blue light cutting in front of the helmet because bruno is going to imagine the movement that needs without being able to move he is walking by himself and more than that more than and if the speed of the exo goes up he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of santos the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident that 's why the so he walks and at the end of the walk i am running out of time already he says you know guys i need to borrow this thing from you when i get married because i wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself of course he will have it whenever he wants and this is what we wanted to show during the world cup because for some mysterious reason fifa cut its broadcast in half what you are going to see very quickly is juliano pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation basically the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go it can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback and when juliano makes the decision to kick the ball you are going to see two streams of green representing the mental commands that were taken and the most amazing thing is ten seconds after he did that and looked at us on the pitch he told us celebrating as you saw i felt the ball and that 's priceless so where going to go i have two minutes to tell you that it 's going to the limits of your imagination brain to brain interface that allows two animals to exchange mental messages so that one animal that sees something coming from the environment can send a mental a but what you see here is the first rat getting informed by a light that is going to show up on the left of the cage that he has to he goes there and does it and the same time he is sending a mental message to the second rat that didn 't see any light and the second rat in seventy percent of the times is going to press the left lever and get a reward without ever experiencing the light in the retina a little higher limit by getting monkeys to collaborate mentally in a brain net basically to donate their brain activity and combine them to move the virtual arm that i showed you before and what you see here is the first time the two monkeys combine the other monkey is controlling the y dimension but it gets a little more interesting when you get three monkeys in there and you make them is the average of all these brains working in parallel in real time that is the definition of a biological computer interacting by brain activity and achieving a motor goal where is this going we have no idea or a mother donates her eyesight to an autistic kid who cannot see or somebody speaks because of a brain to brain bypass so if i 'm understanding correctly one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting no monkey knows of the existence of the other two monkeys they are getting a visual feedback in 2d but each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls but the global synchrony remains the same instantaneously technology will never absorb us it 's simply impossible bg how many times have you tested this and how many times have you succeeded versus failed mn oh tens of times with the three monkeys oh several times i wouldn 't be able to talk about this here unless i had done it a few times and i forgot to mention because of was one bit of information big ideas start in a humble way but basically the brain activity of one subject was transmitted to a second object all and transmitted it to the second subject or a different pulse two different pulses in one pulse the subject saw something on the other pulse he saw something different and he was able to verbally indicate what was the message the first subject was sending through the internet across continents"
