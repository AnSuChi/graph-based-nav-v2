  "transcript": "i 've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to hurricane sandy some of us won medical term called impending doom it 's almost a symptom as a medical provider i 'm trained to respond to this symptom like any other so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says i 'm going to die today i have responded to a number of incidents where the patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing i could do for them with this i was faced with a dilemma do i tell the dying that they are about to face death or do i lie to them to comfort them just grasping for those last moments of life that all changed with one incident i realized that there was nothing that could be done for him he looked me in the eye and asked that question am i going to die i decided to tell him the truth i decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing i could do for him he simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face he was not met with that terror or fear that i thought he would be he simply laid there and as i looked into his eyes i saw inner peace and acceptance from that moment forward i decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies having responded to many cases since then where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing i could do for them in almost every case they have all had the same reaction to the truth of inner peace and acceptance in fact there are three patterns i have observed in all these cases the first pattern regardless of religious belief whether they call it sin i had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack as i prepared myself and prepping for what was going to happen he looked me in the eye and said i wish i had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time faced with imminent death whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones ' they needed to feel that they would be i have had a patient look me eyes and say will you remember me the final pattern i observe always touched me the deepest to the soul the dying need to know that their life had meaning they need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks this came to me as the fire department worked to remove her from the car i climbed in to begin to render care as we talked she had said to me there was so much more i wanted to do with my life she had felt she had not left her mark on this earth as we talked further it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school because of her two children it would end up taking forty five minutes to free her from the regardless of the circumstance it 's generally met with peace and acceptance that it 's the littlest things the littlest moments the littlest things you brought into the world that give you peace in those final moments"
