  "transcript": "ha you probably all agree with me that but not always especially not on these days as today when it 's raining a lot then that 's not very nice and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt porous asphalt a material that we use now in it has pores and water can just rain through it so no splash water anymore also the noise will disappear in these pores because it 's very hollow all the noise will disappear so it 's a very silent road and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur what is raveling you see that in this road then several more and more and more and more and more and then they sometimes you can create potholes with that ha he potholes of course that can become a problem but we have a solution here you see actually how the damage appears in this material it 's a porous asphalt like i said so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones due to u v light due to oxidation then if you drive over the road you take out the aggregates what we just saw here to solve this if we can make this material self healing so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it then you need a machine like you see here that you can use for cooking an induction machine induction can heat especially steel it 's very good at that and the bitumen will flow into these micro cracks and the stones are again fixed to the surface today i use a microwave because i cannot take the big induction so i said we have we have such an industrial and then the government they actually saw our that 's very interesting we have to try that so they donated to us a piece of highway four hundred meters of the so that 's what we did here you see where we were making the test road so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab so we did and so actually the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine this is the big version we have made to go on the real road if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road which of course saves a lot of money well to conclude i can say that we made a material using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road double the surface life you can even do so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks"
