  "transcript": "which is a term i made up and when i first started i would sit down with people been seeing that time horizon get shorter and shorter and shorter so much so that i met with a ceo two months ago and i said we started our initial conversation he goes i love what you do i want to talk about the next six months laughter we have a lot of problems the issue though is we can 't solve them using the mental models that we use right now to try and solve these problems yes a lot of great technical work is being done but there is a problem that we need to solve for a priori before if we want to really move the needle on those big problems there 's no marches there 's no bracelets there 's no petitions that you can sign to be against short termism i tried to put one up and no one signed it was weird but it prevents us from doing so much for many reasons has pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality i just want you to take a second and just think about be personal it could be at work or it could be move the needle world stuff and think about how far out you tend to think about the the solution set for that because so we get the deepwater time with their students so right now in america a high school student drops out every twenty six seconds short termism prevents congress sorry if there 's anyone in here from congress or not really that sorry from putting money into a real infrastructure bill so what we get is the i 35w bridge collapse over the mississippi a few years ago thirteen killed it wasn 't always like this we did the panama canal we but in our seems to happen right now and we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post we get so what do we do and then we build without even thinking about how people are going to get between them and their job it 's a quick buck now the reality is for a lot of these problems there are some i call these technical fixes sandbag strategies and guess what it works and you do this storm after storm after storm and here 's the insidious thing a sandbag strategy can get you reelected a sandbag strategy can help you make your quarterly numbers now if we want to move forward into a different future than the one we have right now because i don 't think we 've hit peak civilization there 's some more we can do but it 's not going to happen so what i 've developed is something called longpath and it 's a practice and and you do you do no offense to the consultants in here who do that and then two weeks later everyone forgets about it right it 's a practice because it 's not necessarily a thing that you so the first but they all did one thing that didn 't actually seem like a big deal until i really started kind of looking into this and they all took as a unit of measure but here 's a problem with these issues which is great and so with which is really kind of transgenerational ethics you 're able to expand how you think about these problems what is your role in helping to solve them now this isn so every and we have three children so you can imagine it 's a very peaceful quiet meal so we sit down and literally all i want to do is just eat and my kids have a completely and totally different idea of what we 're going to be doing and so my is my is my sandbag strategy right it 's to go into my pocket and take out the iphone and give them frozen or and then i stop and i have to kind of put on this and you have to kind of so what does it mean if i actually bring some paper or engage with them in conversation it 's hard it 's not easy and i 'm making this very personal it 's actually more traumatic than some of the big issues that i work on in the world entertaining my kids but what it does is it connects them here in the present with me but it also and this is the the crux of transgenerational thinking ethics it sets them up to how they 're going to interact with their kids and their kids and their kids second futures thinking when we think about the future ten fifteen years out have to give it to me but think in your head and so when we think about the problems we always put it through a technological lens a and there 's nothing wrong with that but it 's something that we have to really think deeply about because it wasn 't always like this right the ancients had their way of thinking about what the future was the church definitely had their idea of what the we got the scientific revolution but what has happened and by the way this is not a critique i love technology everything in my house talks back to me from my children to my speakers to everything but we 've abdicated the future from from the high priests in rome to the high priests so when we think well how are we going to deal with climate or with poverty or homelessness our first reaction but i 'm not saying we go we go to joel what i 'm saying is we have to rethink our base assumption about only looking at the future in one way only it through the dominant lens because our problems are so big and so vast that we need to open ourselves up so that 's why it opens the conversation again so when you 're sitting and thinking about how do we move forward on this major issue it could be at home it could be at work on the global stage don 't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix because we 're more concerned about technological evolution right now than we are about moral evolution and unless we fix for that we 're not going to be able to get out of short termism and get to where we want to be and it 's really asking one question to what end when was the last time you asked yourself to what end and when you asked yourself that how far out did you go because long isn 't long enough anymore three five years doesn 't cut it it 's thirty forty fifty one hundred years in homer 's epic the odyssey odysseus had it was this bold vision of but what comes after and unless you define what comes after people aren 't going to seventy five years old and what 's amazing is that they literally embody this kind of longpathian sense in their brand because by the way you never actually own a patek it 's not it it requires us to push into it it 's not this thing that washes over us it 's something that we actually have total control we end up feeling like we don 't we feel like we 're trapped we can push through that now i 'm getting more comfortable in the fact that at some point both in the and what i 'm leaving my kids i get more comfortable in that fact and it 's something that a lot of us are really uncomfortable with but i 'm telling you think it through apply this type of thinking and you can push yourself past what 's inevitably very very uncomfortable and it all begins really with yourself asking this question what is your longpath but i ask you when you ask yourself that now or tonight or behind a steering wheel or in the boardroom or the situation room push past the longpath quick oh what 's my longpath the next three years or five years try and push past your own life if you can because it makes you do things a little bit bigger than you thought were possible yes we have huge huge problems out there thank you"
