  "transcript": "but now i 'm not talking about gorking people out to fly to mars or even pandora much fun as that may be i 'm talking about the concept of using suspended animation to help people out in trauma so what do i mean when i say suspended animation it is the process by which animals so what i 'm going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who 's in trauma find a way to de animate them a bit so they 're a little more immortal when they have that heart attack an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores these creatures and bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive but in suspended animation for as long as two hundred and fifty million years to suggest that this all sort of about little tiny creatures i want to bring it close to home in the immortal germ line of human beings that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to fifty years in the life of each woman this is those of you with children you know about them the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely so these ideas of suspended animation are not just about cells and weird little organisms occasionally human beings are briefly de animated and the stories and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her a couple of years later so i get really excited about these things about a couple of years later there was and they brought her back to life there was a 65 year old woman in duluth minnesota last year and they brought her back to life the next day she was doing so well they wanted to run tests on her she got cranky and just went home doctors have a saying that in fact you 're not dead until you 're warm and dead it 's true in the new england journal of medicine there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming people who had suffered so what i was trying to do is think of a way that we could study suspended animation to think about a way to reproduce maybe what happened to the skier well i have to tell you something very in this room there 's twenty percent oxygen or so and if we reduce the oxygen concentration we will all be dead and in fact the animals we were working with in the lab these little garden worms nematodes they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen and here 's the thing that should freak you out and that is that when we lower the oxygen concentration further by one hundred is conserved we can see it in a variety of different and we can turn its heartbeat on and off so this was pretty shocking to me and so i was wondering when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier that we noticed that of course she had no and so what we found they 're all and so we wondered might there be some agent that is in us something that we make ourselves that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility in such a way as to be able to survive when we got extremely cold and might otherwise pass away i i should mention briefly here that physiology textbooks that you can read about will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest we have from the time we are slapped on the butt until we take our last dying 're newborn to when we 're dead we we cannot reduce our metabolic rate below what 's called a standard or basal metabolic rate they reduce their metabolic rate in the wintertime when they hibernate and so we went looking for such things this was a period of time when we failed tremendously and we failed over and over again so one time i was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed and i was watching a television show it was a television show it was a nova show show the highest concentration is in our brains yet it was used as a chemical warfare agent in world war i in fact in chemical accidents hydrogen sulfide is known but if you were i 'd like to buy some concentrated compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because i have these ideas it 's really going to be ok so that that 's kind of a tough day but i said there really is and so we thought like in a game of musical chairs might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind and because you can 't bind the oxygen maybe you wouldn 't consume it and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen i mean who knows so laughter so there 's the bit about the dopamine and being and you might suggest that was it and so we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in so it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse it stopped moving i told you hydrogen sulfide is in us it and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de animation is simply put the thing out in room air and it warms up and it 's none the worse for wear this was cosmic really because we had found a way to and it didn 't hurt it now we 'd found a way to reduce its oxygen consumption to rock bottom levels and it was but so we started to think and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died as we found out with our worm experiments so we wondered can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility and one of the things we wondered i 'm sure some of you out there are economists and you know all about supply and demand and when supply is equal to demand so what i just told you is we can now reduce we ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal and with money we got from darpa and you can put them into oxygen well this was really cool we also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss and we could save them so these proof of concept experiments led and we should take this out to a wider playing field i founded a company called ikaria and this company the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine and the results are incredibly positive in one model of heart attack animals given hydrogen sulfide seventy percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and i would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen and i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low incredibly low in fact so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i just mentioned adopting this you don 't want to be gorking people out just to save them it 's really confusing so and so thank you the phase one safety studies are over and we 're doing fine we 're now moved on we have to and this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people i want to mention that first of all my wife without whom this talk and my work would not be possible so thank you very much also the brilliant scientists who work at my lab and also others on staff the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle washington wonderful place to work and also the wonderful scientists and businesspeople at ikaria one thing those people did out there was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide which and they fused it with another company that sells another toxic gas that 's more toxic than and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die now is approved on label and saves thousands of babies a year from certain death so it 's really and that in the not too distant future an emt might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide or some related compound and that person might de animate a bit they might become a little more immortal their metabolism will fall and then they will have the time that will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need like the 65 year old woman we hope not or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common"
