  "transcript": "what i 'm going to do in the spirit of collaborative creativity is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made but do them this is called creative collaboration but do it through a particular perspective and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that jimmy and others have talked about let me just ask you to start with this simple question who invented the mountain bike because traditional economic theory would say well the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r & d lab where they were thinking and it came out of there it didn 't come from there another answer might be well it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage who working away on different kinds of bikes comes up with a bike out of the mountain bike came from users came from young users particularly a group in who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes which were those sort of bikes that eddy merckx rode or your big brother and they 're very glamorous but also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode which sort of had big handlebars like that and they were too heavy so they got the frames from these big bikes put them together with the gears from the racing bikes got the brakes from motorcycles and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients and for the first i don 't know three to five years of their life mountain and then one of these companies that was importing parts for the clunkers decided to set up in business start selling them to other people and gradually another company emerged out of that marin maybe even fifteen mountain bike sales and mountain bike equipment account for sixty five percent of bike sales in america that 's fifty eight billion dollars this is a category entirely created by consumers they didn 't have the incentive to innovate the one thing i think i disagree with yochai 's presentation is when he said the internet causes this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive it 's when the internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro am consumers who are knowledgeable they 've got the incentive to innovate they 've got the tools they want to that you get this kind of explosion of creative need for the kind of things that jimmy was talking about which is our new kinds of organization or a better way to put it how do we organize ourselves without organizations that 's now possible still enshrined in much of the way that we think about creativity is that creativity is about special people elite universities r & d labs in the forests water maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors odd table football table special people special places think up special ideas then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas down to the waiting consumers who are passive or you 're running a large company build creative clusters in and one of the reasons it 's wrong is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline the ideas one issue is that radical innovation when you 've got ideas that affect a large number of technologies or people have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them the payoffs to are greatest where the uncertainty is highest and when you get a radical innovation it 's often very uncertain how it can be applied the whole history of telephony is a story of dealing with that uncertainty the inventors thought that they would be used for people to listen in to live performances from west end theaters when the mobile telephone companies invented sms they had no idea what it was for it was only when that technology got into the hands of teenage users that they invented the use the more the uncertainty the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for all of our patents our entire approach to patents and is based on the idea that the inventor knows what the invention is for we can say what it 's for more and more the inventors of things will not be able to say that in advance it will be worked out in use in collaboration with users the truth is that most creativity is cumulative and collaborative like wikipedia the second reason why users are more and more important is that they are the source of big disruptive innovations in big organizations and just look inside large organizations and you 'll see why that is so you 're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder do you go into your board and say look i 've got a fantastic idea and i 'm not sure it 's going to have a big payoff but it could be really really big in the future what you do is you go in and you say i 've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation to an existing product we sell through existing channels to existing users and i can guarantee you get this much return out of it over the next three years they 've got so much sunk in it that it 's very difficult for them to spot emerging new markets emerging new markets then are the breeding grounds for passionate users best example thirty years ago would have said yes let 's invent a musical form which is all about dispossessed black men in ghettos expressing their frustration with the world through a form of music that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture would never have come from the big companies had to start and across a whole range of fields from software astronomy natural sciences vast areas of leisure and culture like kite surfing so on and so forth you find people they use technology that 's getting cheaper it 's not just the internet leisure technology surfboards so on and so forth largely through globalization a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper more knowledgeable consumers more educated more able to connect with one another more able to do things together consumption in that sense is an expression of their productive potential why we found people were interested in this is that at work they don 't feel very expressed they don 't feel as if they 're doing something that really matters to them so they pick up these kinds of activities this has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life take astronomy as an example which thirty years ago only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space and there 's a big telescope in northern england called jodrell bank and when i a kid it was amazing because the moon shots would take off and this thing would move on rails and it was huge it was absolutely enormous now six amateur astronomers working with the internet with dobsonian digital telescopes which are pretty much open source so here in astronomy you have this vast explosion of new productive resources well just imagine a world for the moment divided into two camps over here you 've got the old traditional corporate model special people special places patent it push it down the pipeline to largely waiting passive consumers let 's imagine linux and beyond open source this is open this is closed this is new this is traditional well i think with certainty is what yochai has said already is there is a great big struggle between those two organizational forms because they 're threatened by them and so the debates about copyright digital in my view these kinds of organizations what we 're seeing is a complete corruption of the meant to be a way to incentivize invention let me just give you two examples the first is imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist and saying i 've got a fantastic idea i 've invented this brilliant new program that is much much better than microsoft outlook which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture competing with microsoft with microsoft outlook no one that is why the competition with microsoft is bound to come will only come from an open source kind of project so there is a huge competitive argument about sustaining the capacity for open source and consumer driven innovation because it 's one of the greatest competitive levers because the professionals over here in these closed organizations they might be academics they might be they might be journalists my former profession say no no you can 't trust these people over here when i started in journalism financial times twenty years ago it was very very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper usually they were reading the share prices and the the bit of the paper with your article on was on the floor or something like that and you know for heaven 's sake what are they doing they 're not reading my brilliant article where they could write a letter in and we would condescend to cut it in half and print it three days later or the op ed page where if they knew the editor had been to school with him slept with his wife shock horror now the readers want to be writers and publishers that 's not their role they 're supposed to read what we write but they don 't want to be they want to as jimmy said they want to have a dialogue a conversation they want to be part of that what 's happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding so there 's going to be a tremendous struggle but also there 's going to be tremendous movement from the open to the closed if this is so critical do we not need it funded organized supported in much more structured ways what kind of changes do we need in public in that world what should be the role of public policy and finally what i think you will see is the intelligent closed organizations moving increasingly in the open direction so it 's not going to be a contest between two camps in between them you 'll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy new organizational models coming about mixing closed and open in tricky it won 't be so clear cut it won 't be microsoft versus linux there 'll be all sorts of things in between let me just give you one final example of what that means i was in shanghai and i was having dinner with this guy called timothy chan timothy chan set up an internet business in two thousand didn 't go into the internet kept his money decided to go into computer games has two how many people does he employ to service that population five hundred how can he service two hundred and fifty million people from five hundred employees because basically he doesn 't service them he gives them a platform he gives them some rules he gives them the tools and it creates a kind of stickiness the community and the company which is really really powerful the best measure of that so you go into one of his games if for some reason your credit card bounces or you 've got two options right from scratch but with none of the history queue up outside shanda 's offices cost probably six hundred seven hundred dollars and reclaim your character get your history back every morning there are six hundred people queuing outside their offices so this is about companies built on communities that provide communities with tools resources platforms in which they can share so here is one of the challenges i think for people like me who if you 're a games company you only need one contributing ideas and you 've got a development workforce of ten thousand people and one percent of them were co developers of education what would that do to the resources available to the education system or if you got one percent of the patients in the nhs to in some sense be of health the reason why despite all the efforts to cut it down to constrain it to hold it back why these open models will still start"
