  "transcript": "i am a chef and a food policy guy but i come from a whole family of teachers my sister is a special ed teacher in chicago my father just retired my aunt and uncle were professors my cousins all teach everybody in my family basically teaches except for me they taught me that the only way to get the right answers so what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for but i think the following is a good place to start what can we expect our kids to learn if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients what can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally and with all the resources that we are pouring into schools we should stop and ask ourselves are we really setting our kids up for success now a few years ago i was a judge on a cooking competition called chopped four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes except for this episode it was a very special one instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight something that i would know nothing about these chefs were school chefs you know the women that you used to call lunch ladies but the ones i insist we call school chefs these women god bless these women spend their day cooking for thousands of kids breakfast and lunch with only six eight per lunch with only about a dollar of that actually going to the food now i know it 's been a long time since most of you have had a school lunch and we 've made a lot of progress on nutrition but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut it was a pappardelle with italian sausage kale parmesan and it was so i took on the tv accusatory judge thing that it 's a monday there were no meals on the weekends no meals on she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat something that would stick to their ribs she said something that would fill them up cheryl talked about how by the time monday came her hunger pangs were so intense that they couldn 't even begin to think about learning food was the only thing on their mind the only thing and we 're going to focus on the most important meal of the day she 's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up if allison goes to a school here 's what 's going to follow her chances of getting a nutritious meal one with fruit and milk one lower in sugar and salt dramatically increase allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid she 'll have to visit the nurse less because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school allison is in much better health so what about that kid who doesn 't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for he wants to be a doctor by the time tommy is in kindergarten he 's already underperforming in math he 's got lower math and reading scores research shows that kids who do not have consistent nourishment particularly at breakfast have poor cognitive function let me give you two stats that seem like they 're on opposite ends of the of the issue but are actually two sides of the same coin including sixteen million children almost twenty percent are food insecure in this city alone in new york city four hundred and seventy four thousand kids under the age of eighteen face hunger every year it diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country now what 's hard to put together but is true is that many times these are the same children so they fill up on on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities but then by the but we should be able to solve this problem right we know what the answers are as part of my work at the white house we instituted a program that for all schools that had forty percent more low income kids we could serve breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school for free this program has been incredibly successful because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast and that was the barrier of stigma see schools serve it was only available for the poor kids well the schools that have and research shows that when kids have a consistent nutritious breakfast their chances of graduating increase by twenty percent twenty percent when we give our kids the nourishment they need we give them the chance to thrive donna martin is the school nutrition director at burke county and about one hundred percent of donna 's students live at or below the poverty line she improved and she implemented a dinner program why well the kids loved the food but donna 's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place his name from eric parker and he was the head football coach for the burke county bears coach parker had coached mediocre teams for years the bears often ended in the middle of the pack a but the year donna changed the menus the bears not only won beating the peach county trojans and it 's not just up to the cheryl barbaras and the donna martins of the world it 's on all of us and feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point what i 've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face if we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves we could see a world that is more stable and secure we could dramatically improve our economic productivity we could transform our health care and we could go a long way in ensuring that the earth can provide for generations to come food is that place where our collective efforts so we have to ask ourselves what is the right question what would happen if we fed ourselves coach parker and the burke county bears thank you guys so very much"
