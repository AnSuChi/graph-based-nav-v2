  "transcript": "and along the way i 've started noticing i 'm on my third generation of kids that they 're getting bigger they 're getting sicker in addition to these complexities i just learned that seventy percent of the kids that i see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition but i 'm the oldest sixth grader you 'll ever meet so i get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that i 'm hoping to share with you all today i come to you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their communities to live learn and earn in a better one so i 'm here to tell you a story about me and and it starts with three people my passionate borough president and a guy named george irwin from green living technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology in my place which looks like this and i 'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp and that 's really what this is all about and it starts with incredible kids like this who come early and stay late i am not a farmer so i wanted to figure out how i could get this kind of success into something small like this and bring it into my classroom so that and lo and behold we gave birth to the first edible wall in new york city so if you 're hungry get up and eat you can do it right now my kids play cow all the time okay and my kids from the poorest congressional district in america became but closer to home we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that and that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in america i met nice people like you and they invited us to the hamptons so i call this from south bronx to southampton and so we got invited back this past and when you can do stuff like this these are my kids putting in this technology and when you can build a roof that looks like that on a house that looks like that you may wonder what does a wall like this really do for kids besides changing landscapes and mindsets because jim now i gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me that 's the beauty of this economy licensed and bonded in trade and that 's my first student to open up the first in his family to have a bank account atm but this i show you when kids from the poorest congressional district in america design it plant it and install it in the heart of new york city that 's a true s se puede moment really scholastic if you ask me but this is not a getty image that 's a picture i took of my bronx borough president addressing my kids in his house not the jailhouse making them feel a part of it that 's our state senator gustavo rivera and bob bieder coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important so do i and i tell you what i 'm doing it and so are the kids and when we realized that we were growing for food justice a year ago today i was invited i thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy new york made sense especially when the resources were free so thank you all and i love them they introduced me to the new york city strategic alliance for health again free my school and my kids were awarded the first ever high school award of excellence but more importantly is my kids learned to get and that 's when i realized that the greening of america starts first with the pockets then with the heart and trained and certified ma you get the tax abatement thank you mayor bloomberg can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that and that me people is another true s se puede moment now group by your favorite vegetable something you can aspire to okay and these are my future farmers of america growing up in brook park on 141st street the most migrant it 's no wonder we get fruit like that and i love it and so brook park feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint the poorest congressional district in america the most migratory community in america and we 're doing it and most importantly when you put big kids together with little kids you get the big fat white guy out of the middle this kind of accountability amongst peers which is incredible god i 'm going to run out of time so i 've gotta keep it moving but i gotta tell you i 'm a protective parent but those kids are the kids who are now putting pumpkin patches on top of trains we 're also designing coin now i don 't expect every kid to be a farmer but i expect you to read about it i expect them to be engaged and man are they so that 's my incredible classroom that 's the food where does it go zero miles to plate right down into the cafeteria or more importantly to local shelters where most of our kids are getting one to two meals and we 're stepping it up no air jordans were ever ruined on my farm and in his day a million dollar gardens and incredible installations let me tell you something people this is a beautiful moment we take orders now forty percent attendance to ninety three percent attendance all start overage and under credit they are amazed people the glory but so help us go from this to this self sustaining eighteen months return on investment plus we 're paying people living wage and health benefits while feeding people for pennies on the dollar and most importantly get the biggest bully out of schools this has got to go tomorrow people you that keep make them a healthy model good behavior get them to a green cart big kids love strawberries and bananas teach them entrepreneurship thank god for nothing works like unconditional love so my good friend kermit said it 's not easy being green i urge you to do something right now we 're all tadpoles but i urge you to become a big frog and take that big green leap i don 't care if you 're on the left on the right up the middle join me use i 've got a lot of energy help me use it and along the way please take time to smell the flowers especially if you and your students grew them thank you god bless you and enjoy the day i 'm steve ritz"
