  "transcript": "how can we investigate this flora of viruses that surround us and aid medicine how can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a when we started thinking about this project how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously 're also evolving very fast this is a picornavirus picornaviruses these are things that include the common cold and polio things like this you 're looking at the outside shell of the virus and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very very fast and the blue parts are not evolving very fast when people think about making pan viral detection reagents usually problem that 's an issue because how can we detect things if they 're always changing but evolution is a balance you also have and i 'm going to show you data now this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop i took a bunch of these small picornaviruses like the common cold like polio and so on and i just broke them down into small these sequences right up here which don 't even code for protein by the way are almost absolutely identical across all of these so i could use this sequence as without having to make something individual now over acute bee paralysis virus probably a bad one to have if you 're a bee but i can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the and so we can encapsulate these regions of through evolution how these viruses evolved printing dna we took our chip over to hewlett packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots and this is what you see you can actually see the strands of dna lying flat on the glass here so what we 're doing is just printing dna on glass little flat things and these are going to be markers for and i 'm really big on disseminating technology if you 've got enough money to buy just a camry you can build one totally free with basically order off the shelf parts you can build a dna array machine in your garage here 's the section on the all important emergency stop switch but really it 's pretty robust you can actually be making dna chips in your in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly it 's a lot of fun a really cool project we just started by making a respiratory virus chip situation where you go into the clinic and you don 't get diagnosed well we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip and we threw in herpes virus for good measure i mean why not the and so what we did is we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells mostly viral stuff and stick it on the array to see where it sticks now if the dna sequences match they 'll stick together and so we can look at spots and if spots light up we know there 's a certain virus in there that 's what one of these chips really looks like and these red spots are in what we did is we took tissue culture cells and infected them with adenovirus and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus and likewise we infected them with that 's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere it 's like boogeremia basically you can see that this barcode is the same family but it 's distinct from parainfluenza 3 which gives you a very bad cold and so we 're getting unique signatures a fingerprint for each virus and so it is not any one it 's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing all right i can see a rhinovirus and here 's the blow up of the rhinovirus 's little barcode but what about different rhinoviruses how do i know which rhinovirus i have there 're one hundred and two known variants of the common here are four different rhinoviruses and you can see even with your eye without any fancy algorithms that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other now this is kind of a cheap shot because i know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is and i in fact designed the chip expressly to be able to tell them apart but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer we don 't know what the sequence is just pull them out of the field shooting fish in a barrel you know right you have tissue culture cells there are a ton of viruses what about real people you can 't control real people as you probably know you have no idea what someone 's going to cough into a cup and it 's probably really complex right it could have lots of bacteria it could have more than one virus and it certainly has host genetic material so and basically we experimentally inoculate people with the common cold virus or even better let 's just take people right out of the emergency room undefined nothing happening they 're healthy they 're clean it 's amazing actually we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you 're walking around healthy it 's pretty clean if you 're healthy so they both have rhinoviruses we never seen this pattern in lab we sequenced part of their viruses they 're new rhinoviruses no one 's actually even seen remember sequences we 're using on this array allow us to detect even novel or uncharacterized viruses because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution here 's another guy you can play the diagnosis game yourself here these different blocks represent the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family down the blocks and see where the signal is well doesn 't have canine distemper that 's probably good laughter but by the time you get to block nine you see that respiratory syncytial virus maybe they have kids and then you can see also the family member that 's related rsvb sampled on two separate days repeat visits to the clinic that 's mouse parainfluenza everything that we could get out of genbank that is the national repository of sequences first of all you have a big chip like this you need a little bit more informatics so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis and the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns because we 're never going to get samples of every virus it would be virtually impossible but we can get virtual patterns and compare them to our observed result which is a very complex mixture and come up with some sort of score of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something that 's the idea and we 're setting this up in the bay area and so this case report happened three weeks we have a 28 year old healthy woman no travel history [ unclear ] doesn 't smoke doesn 't drink 10 day history of fevers night sweats bloody sputum she 's coughing up blood muscle pain she went to the clinic and they gave her antibiotics and she 's hypoxic she doesn 't have much oxygen in her lungs they did a so the patient was treated then with a and on day three it didn 't help she they had to intubate her so they put a tube down her throat and they began to mechanically ventilate her she could no longer breathe for herself and and so basically and what do they learn from it and so they tested her for over seventy different assays for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf sars metapneumovirus over one hundred thousand dollars worth of tests i that 's when they called us they gave us endotracheal aspirate you know a little fluid from the throat from this tube that they got down there we saw it 's not even really sequenced that much there 's just a little bit of it sequenced there 's almost no epidemiology or studies on it there 's no data no data to support whether it causes severe report i 'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that 's unpublished it 's going to come out tomorrow and it 's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door prostate cancer i third leading cause of cancer deaths in the u s lots of risk factors but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer there are folks that are predisposed to it and the first gene that was mapped in association studies for this early onset prostate cancer was this gene called rnasel what is that it 's an antiviral defense enzyme so we 're sitting around and thinking why would men who have the mutation a defect in an antiviral defense system get prostate cancer make sense unless maybe there 's a virus so we put tumors and now we have over one hundred tumors and i 'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos and what i 'm telling you here from the that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme and have a tumor what is it so we clone the whole virus it 's a classic gamma retrovirus but it and we can say that they 're all and we find cells here with viral particles in them these guys really do have this virus"
