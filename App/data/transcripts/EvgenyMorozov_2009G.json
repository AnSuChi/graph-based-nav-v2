  "transcript": "so bear with me as some of you may know is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy i decided to join the ngo which actually was using new media to promote democracy and media reform in much of the former soviet union however to my surprise i discovered that dictatorships do not crumble so easily in fact some of them actually survived the internet challenge and some got even more repressive so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede i must tell you that this was never a very popular argument and it 's probably not very popular yet with some of you sitting in this audience it was never popular with many political leaders especially those in the united states who somehow thought that new media would be able to do what missiles couldn 't so i should probably add gordon brown to this list as well however there is an underlying argument about logistics which has driven so much of this debate right so if you look at it close enough you 'll actually see that much of this is the cybertopians say much like fax machines and xerox machines did in the ' 80s so people would inevitably rebel if you give them enough devices i never really bought into this argument in part because i never saw three american presidents agree on anything else in the past but you know even beyond that if you think about the logic underlying it is something i call ipod liberalism where we assume that every single iranian or chinese who happens to have and love his ipod will also love liberal democracy but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic that we should be dropping ipods not bombs i mean it would make a fascinating title for thomas friedman 's new book but this is rarely a good sign so the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology for those of you who think that new media of the internet could somehow help us avert genocide should look no further than rwanda where in the ' 90s it was actually two radio stations which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the but even beyond that coming back to the internet what you can actually see is that certain governments and they are building what i call the spinternet the combination of spin on the one hand and the internet on the other so governments from russia to china to iran are actually hiring training well my theory is that it 's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places the moment you put something critical so the more you block it the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus so the only way to and again this is happening quite often just to give you an example of how it works in china for example there was a big case in february two thousand and nine so what happened is that and police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek which is elude the cat in chinese slang with other inmates and hit his head against the wall which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers so they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments in fact but then authorities did something very smart and they basically said look guys we 'd like you to become netizen and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question within days the entire incident was forgotten which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content people would keep talking about it for weeks and this actually fits with another interesting theory about what 's happening in authoritarian states and in their cyberspace this is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics and letting them engage with each other online we tend to think that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships but in many cases it only strengthens them and you may wonder why i 'll just give you a very short list of reasons why authoritarian deliberation may and first it 's quite simple most of them operate in a complete information vacuum so encouraging people to actually go online and share information and data on blogs and wikis is great because low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats will continue secondly involving public in any decision making is also great because it helps you to share the blame for the policies which eventually fail because they say well look we asked you we consulted you you voted on it you put it on the front and finally it 's actually great because what happens is that then you can actually point to this initiative and say well we are now involves its citizens in so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year two thousand and twenty i so having people involved in is not necessarily going to change anything because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda just to give you an example from iran we all heard about the twitter revolution that happened there but the activists could still access it and actually argue that having access to them is actually great for many authoritarian states and simply because they can gather open source intelligence if not months to identify how iranian activists connect to each other now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page i mean kgb and not just kgb used to torture in order to actually get this data now it 's all available online i think the biggest conceptual pitfall that how people are becoming passive why because they somehow assume that the internet is going to be and there is nothing wrong about it because the internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them if you so it does play a social role however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement but the point is that when we get the remote russian village online what will get people to the internet is not going to be the reports from human rights watch it 's going to be pornography sex and the city or maybe watching funny videos of cats so this is something you have to recognize"
