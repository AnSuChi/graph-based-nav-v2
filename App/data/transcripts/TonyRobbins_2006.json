  "transcript": "my excitement is i get a chance to give something back my challenge is the shortest seminar i usually do is fifty hours i 'm not exaggerating i do weekends i do more obviously i also coach people but i 'm into immersion because how did you learn language not just by learning principles you got in it and you did it so often that it became real the bottom line of why i 'm here besides being a crazy mofo is that i not here to motivate you you don 't need that obviously often that 's what people think i do and it 's the furthest thing from it what happens though is people say activated is the most important thing i 'm here because i believe emotion is the force of life because when emotion comes into it the wiring changes in the way it functions so it 's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head but i really want to know what 's driving you what i would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today for two reasons one so that you can contribute more but appreciate them more and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today they 're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us i 've had an obsession basically for thirty years what makes the difference in the quality of people 's lives and they were ahead by five strokes i get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide i but i haven 't yet the reason is an understanding of these human needs when i get those calls about performance that 's one thing how do you make a change i 'm also looking to see what is shaping the person 's ability to contribute to do something beyond themselves maybe the real question is i look at life and say there 's two master lessons one is how do you take the invisible and make it visible you can only feel so much by yourself i 've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question those people that you 've given everything to like all the resources they say they need you gave not a 100 dollar computer but the best computer you gave them love joy were there to comfort them those people very often you know some of them end up the rest of their life with all this love education money and background going in and out of rehab and not always but often they become some of the people that contribute the most to society the question we 've got to ask ourselves really is what is it that shapes us we live in a therapy culture most of us don 't do that but the culture 's a therapy culture the mindset that we are our past the past equals the future but what we know and what we have to remind ourselves because you can know something intellectually and then not use it not apply it ask people why didn 't you achieve something somebody who 's working for you or a partner or even yourself when you fail to achieve what 's the reason people say what do they tell you didn 't have the knowledge didn 't have the money didn 't have the time didn 't have the technology i didn 't have the including the supreme court have but that is not the defining factor and you correct me if i 'm wrong the defining factor is never resources it 's resourcefulness and what i mean specifically just some phrase is if you have emotion human emotion something that i experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as i 've ever experienced and i believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won but there was emotion there do you know what i 'm talking about say aye audience aye tr so emotion if you don 't have the money but you 're creative and determined you find the way this is the ultimate resource but this is not the story that people tell us if you take a look here but i appreciated the energy i 'll tell you that what determines your resources we 've said decisions shape destiny which is my focus here you have to decide what you 're going to focus on consciously or unconsciously the minute you decide to focus you must give it a meaning and that meaning produces emotion is this the end or the beginning or the action and that sounds really heavy but in the last five or ten years have there been some decisions that if you 'd made a different decision your life would be completely different how many can think so the bottom line is maybe it was where to go to work and you met the love of your life there a career decision i know the google geniuses i saw here what if they made that decision versus to build their own culture how would the world or their lives be different their impact the history of our world is these decisions when a woman stands up and says standing in front of a tank or being in a position like lance armstrong you 've got testicular cancer that 's pretty tough for any male especially if you ride a bike but what was his decision of what to focus on different than most people what did it mean it wasn 't the end it was the beginning he goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer because he got emotional fitness psychological strength that 's the difference in human beings that i 've seen of the three million i 've been around in my lab i 've had three million people from eighty countries and after a while patterns become obvious you see that south america and africa may be connected in a certain way it wasn 't your ability it was your state your model of the world is what shapes you long term your model of the world is the filter that 's what 's shaping it makes people make decisions to influence somebody we need to know what already influences them it 's not your desires you can get your desires or goals who has ever got a goal or desire and thought is this all there it 's needs we have i believe there are six human needs once you know what the target that 's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth you don 't form it then you find out what 's your map what 's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world some people to build create something love someone so very quickly six needs let me tell you what they are first one certainty develop a skill give smoke a cigarette and if you got totally certain ironically even though we need that you 're not certain about your health or your children or money if you 're not sure the ceiling will hold up you won 't listen to any speaker while we go for certainty differently if we get total certainty we get what what do you feel if you 're certain you know what will happen when and how it will happen what would you feel the ones you don 't want you call problems but you need them so variety is important have you ever rented a video or a film that you 've already seen who 's done this get a fucking life we all need to feel important special unique you can get it by making more money or being more spiritual you can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don 't want to know whatever it takes fastest way to do this if you have no background no culture no belief and resources or resourcefulness is violence and it 's significant isn 't it so you want to risk your life for it so that 's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a if you don 't raise your hand you 've had other shit too and you 're going to get you glad you came to this positive visit we can do it through intimacy friendship prayer through walking in nature if nothing else works for you don 't get a cat get a dog because if you leave for two minutes it 's like you 've been gone six months when you come back five minutes later these first four needs every human finds a way to meet even if you lie to yourself we all know the answer if you don 't grow you 're what if a relationship or business is not growing if you 're not growing doesn 't matter how much money or friends you have how many love you you feel like hell and i believe the because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves when you see nicholas talking about his $ one hundred computer the most exciting thing is here 's a genius but he 's got a calling now you can feel the difference in him and it 's we were not going to starve but my father was totally messed up my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up leave my family which he did it was the most painful experiences of life my three decisions gave me a different path i set focus on there 's food what a concept laughter but this is what changed my life shaped me as a human being somebody 's gift i don 't even know who it is my father always said no one gives a shit and now somebody i don 't know they 're not asking for anything just giving us food looking out for us it made me believe this that strangers that made me decide if strangers care about me and my family i care about them i 'm going to do something to make a difference so when i was seventeen i went out on thanksgiving it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families the most fun and moving thing i ever did in my life but after eight i thought i could use some help i went out got my friends involved then i grew companies got eleven and i built the foundation eighteen years later i 'm proud to tell you last year we fed two million people in thirty five countries through our foundation all during the holidays thanksgiving christmas in different countries around the world thank you i don 't tell you that to brag but because i 'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they 've had the chance to experience it not talk about the target that shapes you but are you a certainty freak is that what you value most or uncertainty this man couldn 't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves the operating system tells you how to get there and some people 's map is i 'm going to save lives even if i die for other people and they 're a fireman and somebody else says i 'm going to kill people to do it they want to and there are seven different beliefs i can 't go through them because i 'm done the last piece is emotion one of the parts of the map is like time some people 's idea of a long time is one hundred years somebody else 's is three seconds which is what i have and the last one i 've already mentioned that fell to you if you 've got a target and a map i can 't use google because i love macs and they haven 't made it good for macs yet so if you use mapquest how many have made this fatal mistake of using it you use this thing and you don 't get there imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go laughter but and i give them as long as they need and on one side they write empowering emotions the other 's disempowering guess how many emotions they experience less oh shit frustrated frustrated overwhelmed depressed how many of you know somebody who no matter what happens finds a way to get pissed off the night before was called emotional mastery i got up had no plan for this and i said and all of a sudden i said when do people really start to live when they face death and i went through this whole thing about if you weren 't going to get off this island if nine days from now you were going to die who would you call what would you say what would you do that night is when nine eleven happened one woman had come to the seminar and when she came there her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered her new boyfriend wanted to marry her and she said no he said if you go to that hawaii thing it 's over with us she said it 's over when i finished that night she called him and left a message at the top of the world trade center where he worked saying i love you when he called her back and said honey i can 't tell you what this means i don 't know how to tell you this but you gave me the greatest gift because i 'm going to die and he said you 're probably wondering how on earth this could happen to you twice all i can say is this must be god 's message give your all love your all don 't let anything ever stop you she finishes and a man stands up and he says i 'm from pakistan i 'm a muslim i 'd love to hold your hand and say i 'm sorry but frankly this is retribution i can 't tell you the rest because i 'm out of time more than fifty lost their entire companies friends marking off their palm pilots one financial trader woman made of steel bawling what does this mean and what are we going to do and your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else screaming and yelling i found out she wasn 't from new york she 's not an american doesn guilty people got guilty sad people got sad i took these two men and i did an indirect negotiation and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and i made it very clear this integration is on a film which i 'd be happy to send you instead of my verbalization but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world but worked together to bring for almost four years now and synagogues the idea of how to create peace and he wrote a book called my jihad my way of peace so transformation can happen my invitation to you is the web in here the needs the beliefs the emotions that are controlling you for two reasons so there 's more of you to give and achieve but i mean give because that 's what 's going to fill you up and secondly so you can appreciate not just understand that 's intellectual that 's the mind but appreciate what 's driving other people it 's the only way our world 's going to change god bless you thank you"
