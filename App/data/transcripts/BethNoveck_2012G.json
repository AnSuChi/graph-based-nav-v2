  "transcript": "under president adams a local dentist happened by he wanted to shake the president 's hand the president dismissed the secretary of state whom he was conferring with and asked the dentist if he would remove a later under president pierce he was known to have remarked a neighbor passed by and said i 'd love to see the beautiful house and pierce said to him why my dear sir of course you may come in this isn 't my house it is the people 's house well when i got to the white house in the beginning of two thousand and nine at the start of the obama administration the white house house was anything but open bomb blast curtains covered my windows we were running windows two thousand to take the values and the practices of transparency participation and collaboration and instill them into the way that we work to open up government to work with people now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products like cars and computers they work we don 't have institutions that are good at bringing our talents to bear at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way so when we wanted to create our open government policy what did we do we wanted naturally to ask public sector employees how we should open up government turns out that had never been done before no technical way of doing this in fact many people told us it was illegal here 's the crux of the obstacle really values and expertise once every four once every two years at best once a year this is a rather anemic and thin way in this era of social media for us to actually express our values today we have technology that lets us express ourselves a great deal perhaps a little too much but we 've centralized these and we know that the smartest person always works for someone else we need to only look around this room to know that expertise and intelligence is widely and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels the flow of electricity the same can be said for our social systems for our systems of government where at the very least flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding what the problem is what 's really broken we live in a cambrian era of big data of social networks and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions that are actually quite recent think about it what other business do you know what other sector of the economy and especially one as big as the sector now it 's very easy to but the world is complex we soon will have ten billion people many of whom will lack basic resources what comes the day after the arab spring attractive alternative that obviously presents itself to us is that of networks right networks like facebook and twitter they 're lean they 're mean you 've got three thousand employees at facebook governing nine hundred million inhabitants we might even call them citizens because they 've recently risen up to fight against legislative incursion why is twitter so successful because it opens up its platform it opens up the api to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it we need to think about how to open up the api of government and the way that we 're going to do that the next great superpower is going to be the one who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution because we have to maintain those public values we have to coordinate the flow we have a precedent for this good old henry palpable model for handing power from government to citizens and we have the imperative to create thousands of new ways of interconnecting between networks and institutions the hackathon just beginning to invent the models by which we can cocreate the process of governance now but we 're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us maybe not even evolution i 'd even start to call it a revolution some of it 's very high tech and some of it is extremely low tech such as the project that mkss is running in and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll who 's actually getting you and me to raise the money to build the goalposts and the park benches created after the post election riots in kenya in two thousand and eight able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble whether it 's after the earthquakes in haiti or more recently in italy but in many cases to replace but we 're starting to see this practice of people creating and generating innovative applications on top of government data some of you may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen in new jersey where he caters to and serves the homeless and particularly homeless veterans in february he approached the white house and said i would like to fund a prize to create scalable national applications apps that will help not only the homeless but those who deliver services [ to ] them to do so better february two thousand and twelve to june of two thousand and twelve the finalists are announced in the competition can you imagine in the bureaucratic world of because in many cases what it can do when we have the will to do so is to deliver more progressive and better policy than the regulations and the legislative and by which we make policy today in the state of texas they regulate five hundred and fifteen professions from so what is texas doing they 're asking you and me using online policy wikis to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iphone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development that is a nice sideline of open government it 's not only the benefits that we 've talked about with regard to development it 's the economic benefits and the job creation that 's coming from this open innovation work engaging its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations last year they saved a and we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data not simply to make apps but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government so a lot of these innovations are local in san ramon california they published an iphone app in which they allow you or me to say we are certified cpr trained and then when someone has a heart attack a notification goes out so that you can rush over to the person over here and deliver cpr british columbia is publishing a catalogue of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage with the state let me be very clear to solve problems and it doesn 't change government what it does is it creates an adversarial relationship between civil society and government over the control and ownership of information and transparency by itself is not reducing the flow of money into politics and arguably it 's not even producing accountability as well as it might if we took the next step of combining participation and collaboration with transparency to transform how we work we 're going to see this evolution really in the first phase of the open government revolution is delivering better information from the crowd into the center starting in two thousand and five and this is how this open government work in the u s really got started i was teaching a patent law class to my students and explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy has the power to make a decision about which patent application becomes the next patent and therefore monopolizes for twenty years the rights over an entire field of inventive activity well what did we do we said we can make a website we can make an expert network a social network that would connect the network to the institution to allow scientists and technologists to get we piloted the work in the so first phase is in getting better information in the second phase is in getting decision making power out 49th ward in chicago russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together as is lithuania when we start to see power over the core functions of government then we 're well on our way to an open government revolution there are many things that we can do to get us there hackathons and mashathons and working with data to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage and participate like the jury is but we 're going to need lots more things like it and mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos when we start by teaching young people that we live not in a passive society a where we have the power to change our communities to change our institutions that 's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation towards this open government movement towards this open government revolution that we 've talked about"
