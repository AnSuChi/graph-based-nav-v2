  "transcript": "the oceans cover some seventy percent of our planet and i think arthur c clarke probably had it right when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet and the oceans are hugely productive as you can see by the satellite image of photosynthesis the production of new life in fact the oceans produce half in addition to that it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on earth and much of it we don 't know about but i 'll tell you some of that today that also doesn 't even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean that 's about ten percent of our our global needs and one hundred percent of some island nations interrupted only by pinpoints of light from bioluminescent organisms and if you turn the lights on you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by because those are the denizens of the deep the things that live in the deep ocean this type of habitat covers more of the earth 's surface than all other habitats which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans and i hope you 'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve it all began when two scientists fred grassle and jesse ausubel met in woods hole massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute and fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it well from that discussion grew this program that involved two thousand seven hundred scientists from more than eighty countries around the world who engaged in five hundred and forty ocean expeditions at a combined cost and so what did we find we found spectacular new species the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked from the shoreline to the abyss form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between and the limiting step here wasn 't the unknown diversity of life but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and these species that became the limiting step they in fact are an endangered species themselves now i come from newfoundland in canada it 's an island off the east coast of that continent where we experienced one of the worst fishing and i thought that was the norm because i had never seen fish like this if you were to go out there today twenty years after this fishery collapsed if you could catch a fish which would be a bit of a challenge it would be half that size still so what we 're experiencing is something called shifting baselines our expectations of what the oceans can produce now most of us and i would say me included think that human exploitation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last fifty to perhaps one hundred years or so and so anything from restaurant menus to monastery records to ships ' logs to see what the oceans looked like because science data and so at that time of course there was no refrigeration so fishermen could only and so began industrial fishing but for the most part we 've gone from salting to exhausting and so this is a photograph from the 1950s i want you to notice the scale on the slide because when you see the same picture from the 1980s we see the fish are much smaller and we 're also seeing a change in terms of the composition of those fish but this is no laughing matter the oceans have lost a lot of their productivity and we 're responsible for it so one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean are remotely operated vehicles so these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor where they 're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom so a couple of years ago i was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise and i couldn 't go because of a scheduling conflict and i could tell the pilot i want a sample right there and that 's exactly what the pilot so it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light and the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water unlike light and so we can send out and so in this example a census scientist took out two ships one would and to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool because knowing how many fish are there is really critical and so for animals that come to the surface to and so from that we can produce these tracks for example the dark blue shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north pacific now i realize for those of you who are colorblind this slide is not very helpful but stick with me nonetheless for animals that don 't surface we have something called pop up tags which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets and then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and again relays that data back to shore because and so from this we 're able to identify these blue highways these hot spots in the ocean that should be real priority areas for ocean conservation now one of the other things that you may think about is that when you go to the supermarket and you buy things they 're scanned and so there 's a barcode on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding what barcoding does is use a specific gene called co1 that 's consistent within a species but varies among species now one of the nicest examples i like to cite on this is the story of two young women high school students in new york city who worked with the census they went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in new york which is very valuable they also found an endangered species sold as a common one so barcoding allows us to know what we 're working with and also what we 're eating the ocean biogeographic information system is the database for all the census data it 's open access you can and so what you can do with that is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans now what you can see is we 've sampled the area in the north atlantic in the north sea in particular and also the east coast of north america fairly well so even after a 10 year census there are large areas that still remain unexplored and so they put this together a list of all the species where they 're known to occur but then of course there was the deep horizon oil spill so all of a sudden this labor of love for no obvious economic reason has become a critical piece of information in terms of how that system is going to recover how long it will take and how the lawsuits and the multi billion dollar did we find well i could stand here for hours but of course i 'm not allowed to do that but i will tell you some of my favorite discoveries from the census and what we see is that for coastal tags for those organisms that live near the shoreline they 're most diverse in the tropics this is something we 've actually known for a while and that 's why biodiversity data can be so valuable while a lot of the species we discovered in the census are things that are small and hard to see that certainly wasn 't always the case for example while it 's hard to believe that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists but there 's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things we 've dubbed it the jurassic shrimp it 's thought to have gone extinct fifty years ago at least it was until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast shows that the ocean because of its vastness can hide secrets for a very long time so steven spielberg eat your heart out if we look at distributions in fact distributions change dramatically and so one of the records that we had was this sooty shearwater which undergoes these spectacular migrations all the way from new zealand all the way up to alaska and back again in search of endless summer as they complete their life cycles we simply don 't know that 's a question for the future one of the things that we 're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive now this little critter it 's only about half a millimeter in size not terribly charismatic but it was only discovered in the early 1980s but the really interesting thing about it is that a few years ago census and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles and not much biomass in between we found life in the extremes and so there were new species that were found that live inside ice and help to support an ice based food web and we also found this spectacular yeti crab that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at easter island and this particular species really so even new environments are still now in terms of the unknowns there are many and i 'm just going to summarize just a few of them very quickly for you and so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery how many more species we 're likely to discover and from that we actually calculate that we know about sixteen thousand five hundred marine species and what they found is that and so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done so we still have quite a lot of work to do and and so this particular bacterium but the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are a single drop of seawater could contain one hundred and sixty different types of microbes and the oceans themselves are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types so that 's really exciting what are they all doing out there we actually don 't know the most exciting thing i would say about this census is the role of global science and so as we see in this image of light during the night there are lots of areas of the earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it 's much less but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean and so the importance then of global collaboration becomes all the more important we 've lost a lot of paradise for example these tuna that were once so abundant in the north sea are now effectively gone there were trawls taken in the deep sea in the mediterranean which collected more garbage than they did animals and that 's the deep sea that 's the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on earth and there are a lot of other pressures ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with as well as ocean warming and the oceans are so productive there 's so much going on in there that 's of relevance to humans that we really try to do better than we have in the past so we need to recognize those hot spots and do our best to protect them when we look at pictures like this they take our breath away in addition to helping to give us breath by the oxygen that the oceans provide they worked in the cold they worked under water and they worked above water trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery the still vast unknown the spectacular adaptations and as the oceans go so shall we thanks for listening"
