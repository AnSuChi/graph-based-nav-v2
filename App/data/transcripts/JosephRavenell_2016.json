  "transcript": "what do you see most of you see a barbershop but i see an opportunity an opportunity for health an opportunity for health equity the barbershop is not just a place where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed no it 's much more than that solidarity and it 's a place where we go to get away from the stress of the grind of work it 's a place where we don 't have to worry about how we 're being perceived by the outside world it 's a place where we don 't feel threatened or threatening it 's a place of loyalty and trust for that reason 's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves i can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid and like clockwork the same group of men would be there every time we went either waiting on their favorite barber i can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us every time we went and they treated him like a celebrity the men would talk about politics and sports and music national news there was some talk about women but many times they also talked about health the men often recounted their doctor 's recommendations to cut salt in their diet or to eat less fried foods or to stop smoking or to reduce stress they talked about the different ways you could reduce stress like simplifying one 's love life there 's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the that 's because almost forty percent of black men have it that means that almost every single black man sometimes those conversations in the barbershop would be about what happens when high blood pressure is not adequately he was fifty even though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated that death from high blood pressure can be prevented with because too often high blood pressure is either untreated or under treated in black men in part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system are less likely to have a primary care doctor than other groups but why and unnecessary the doctor 's office is only a place that you go when you don 't feel well and when you do go you might wait for hours only to get the run around and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat who only has ten minutes to give you so it 's no wonder that some men don 't want to be bothered and skip going to the especially if they feel fine but herein lies the problem you can feel just fine owner lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors but not so much when you think about it and black men see their barbers about every two weeks denny like many barbers is more than just an he was also orchestrating a voter registration drive to give a voice to his customers and his community with this kind of activism and community investment that typifies the black barbershop of course the barbershop is a perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community first the barbershop is not a medical setting and so it doesn 't have all the negative psychological baggage that comes along with that when you 're in a barbershop and you 're among friends who share your history your struggle loyalty and trust it 's a place where you 're more open to have a conversation about health and especially about high blood after all conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk relationships and high blood pressure and yes what it 's like to be a black man in america but you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop you can concretely take action here we have an opportunity to partner with the denny moe 's of the world and empower communities to address the health inequities that uniquely affect it when high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals to communities in the 1960s and ' 70s black physicians like eli saunders in baltimore these pioneers paved the way for my professional journey with barbershops and health which began in chicago the very first research project that i worked on as a medical student was to help design healthcare interventions that would appeal to black we conducted about a dozen focus groups and we learned that for them being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy as it was about feeling healthy and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good this work led to the development of project brotherhood a community clinic founded by dr eric whitaker part of this tailored care involved having a barber on the premises to reward the men who came for needed healthcare with a free haircut to let the men the next stop on my journey was dallas where we learned that barbers were not only willing but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers and their community the barbers were not only willing to do it but they were damn good at it partnerships resulted in a twenty percent increase in the number of men who were able to achieve target blood pressure levels and a three point drop on average in the blood pressure of each participant five hundred strokes and nine hundred deaths from high blood pressure in just one year our experience with barbershops has been no different in new york city where my journey has currently led me with an incredible team of diverse research assistants community health workers and volunteers we 've been able to partner with over two hundred barbershops and other trusted community venues and we 've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling to each and every one of them thanks to denny moe and the myriad other barbers and community leaders who shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment but we 've also been able to impact other health indicators so what do you see what is your barbershop where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution thank you"
