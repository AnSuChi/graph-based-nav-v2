  "transcript": "and my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital i i was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital you 'll see a lot of and the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band aid off at some point and you must have wondered what 's the right approach do you rip it off quickly short duration but high intensity or do you take your band aid off slowly you take a long time but each second is not as painful which one of those is the right approach the nurses in my department and because i had seventy percent of my body burned it would take about an as you can imagine and i would try to reason with them and say why don 't we try something else why don 't we take it a little longer maybe two hours instead of an hour and have less of this intensity they told me that they had the right model of the patient that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain and they also told me that the word patient doesn 't mean to make suggestions or to interfere or this is not just in hebrew by the way it 's in every language i 've had experience with so far and you know there 's not much there wasn 't much i could do and they kept on doing what what they were doing and about three years later when i left the hospital i started studying at the university and one of the most interesting lessons i learned and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that 's what so originally i didn 't have and i would bring people to the lab and i would put their finger in it and i would crunch it a little bit and with breaks and without breaks all kinds of versions of pain and when i finished hurting people a little bit i would ask them so how painful was this or how painful was this or if you had to choose between the last two i kept on doing this for a while i moved to sounds electrical shocks but at the end of this process what i learned was that the nurses were wrong people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong i would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful and and from that point on i started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it a more general you one example of one of these irrationalities and and the reason i picked cheating is because it 's interesting but also it tells us something i think about the stock market situation we 're in my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden and i started thinking about what is happening here is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing i would say pass me the sheets of paper and i 'll pay you a dollar per question people did this i would pay people four dollars for their task on average people would solve four problems put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly people now solved seven questions on average 't as if and how much punishment would i and you weigh these options out you do the simple cost benefit analysis and you decide whether it 's worthwhile to commit the crime or not so we try to test this fifty cents a dollar five dollars ten dollars per correct question you would expect that as the amount of money on the on the table what about the probability of being caught some people shredded everything went out of the room and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over one hundred dollars but again this was not what could be going on so we don 't want to cheat on the other hand we can cheat a little but we can still benefit from cheating now how would you test we got people to the lab and we said we have two tasks for you today turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all and the less religious people the people who couldn 't remember almost any commandments cheated more in fact even when we gave self declared atheists the task of swearing on the bible and we give them a chance ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why don 't we get people to sign the honor code to sign i understand that this short survey falls under the mit honor code then they shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because mit doesn 't have an honor code what about increasing the fudge factor the first experiment i walked around mit and i and i came back to measure what we technically call the half lifetime of coke how long does it last in the refrigerators as you can expect it doesn 't last very long people take it and i left those plates in the same refrigerators no bill ever disappeared now this is not a good science experiment so to do it better they came to us and said mr experimenter and exchanged it for dollars compared to how bad would you feel about taking ten cents from a petty cash box these things feel very differently would being a step removed from cash for a few because in enron there 's also a social element people see each other behaving in fact every day when we open the news so we did another experiment we got a big group of students to we asked them to pay us back the money they didn 't make but in this experiment we also hired an acting student this acting student stood up what do i do now go home that 's it the task is finished so now we had a student an acting student that was a part of the group nobody knew it was an actor and they clearly cheated in a will they cheat more or will they cheat less it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they 're wearing here is the thing we ran this at carnegie mellon and pittsburgh and at pittsburgh there are two big universities carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh when the actor who was getting up was a carnegie mellon student he was actually a carnegie mellon student but he was but when he actually had a university of pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down now this is important because remember when the moment the student stood up it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating it was about the norms for cheating if but if it 's somebody from another group these terrible people i mean not terrible in this but somebody we don 't want to associate ourselves with from another university another group of a sudden people 's awareness of honesty goes up a little bit like the ten commandments experiment and people cheat even even less so what have we learned from this about cheating when we remind people about their and when we see cheating around us particularly if it 's a part of our in group cheating goes up what happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way would they not be able to see it this way of course they would what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money you call them stock or stock options derivatives mortgage backed securities could it be that with those more distant things it 's not a token for one second it 's something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time could it be that people will cheat i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way i want to tell you something about and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong the question is are we and most particularly when it goes to policy when we think about things like no child left behind when you create new stock markets when you create other policies taxation health care and so on things one was that my favorite nurse ettie told me that i did not take her pain into consideration creating so much torture was not something that was good for me too and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her interesting than that because she said i did not think that your intuition was right i felt my intuition was correct so if you think about all of your and she said given the fact that i thought my intuition was right she thought her intuition was right it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong we have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things our own ability how the economy works but unless we start testing those intuitions we 're not going to do better and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions"
