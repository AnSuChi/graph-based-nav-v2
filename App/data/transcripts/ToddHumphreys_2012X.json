  "transcript": "something happened in the early morning hours of may 2nd two thousand imperceptible unless you knew exactly what to look for on that morning u s president bill clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the global positioning system every civilian gps receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small it 's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us we didn 't have in car navigation systems giving turn by turn directions because back then gps couldn 't tell you what block you were on let alone what street with more base stations more ground stations receivers and better algorithms gps can now not only tell you what street you are on but what part of the street this level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your paper maps are becoming but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy what if i told you that the two meter positioning that our current cell phones and our our tomtoms give us is pathetic compared to what we could be getting and if you have an internet connection then you can go from meter level so why don 't we have this capability on our on our phones only i believe for a lack of imagination manufacturers haven 't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips because they 're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your but you and i and other innovators we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy imagine for example an augmented reality app that overlays a virtual world to millimeter level precision on top of the physical world i could build for you a structure up here in 3d millimeter accurate that only you could see or my friends at home so this level of positioning this is what we 're looking for and i believe that within the next few years i predict that this kind of the holy of course is the gps dot do you remember the movie the da vinci code here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot which his accomplice tells him but we know that in the world of nonfiction for one thing gps doesn 't work indoors and for they don 't make devices quite this small especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network compare that with the device released just months ago that 's now packaged into something the size of a key and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps receiver which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever you realize that the gps dot imagine what we could do with a world full of gps it 's not just that you 'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore or your child when you 're at disneyland you 'll buy gps dots in bulk and you 'll stick them on everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are those of you who have made the switch to gmail remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it the gps dot will do the same for our possessions now of course there is a flip side to the gps dot i was in my office some months back and got a telephone call the woman on the other end of the line we 'll call her carol was panicked so you might ask at this point why she 's calling you well so did i but it turned out there was a technical twist to carol 's case so she was calling me for help to disable it well you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car i said i already and he said he 'd have to take the car apart piece by piece well then you 'd better go to the the police i said i already have she replied and they 're not set up technically to find the device okay what about the fbi i 've talked to them too and same story we then talked about her coming to my lab and us performing a radio sweep of her car given that some of these devices are configured to only transmit when they 're inside safe zones or when the car is moving so there we were carol isn 't the first and certainly won 't be the last to find herself in this kind of worrisome situation caused by gps tracking but the law isn 't clear about civilians doing this to one another so it 's not just big brother we have to worry about but big neighbor there is developed by limor fried a graduate student at and limor calls it a tool for reclaiming our personal space you can buy one chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the internet and why is that well because it 's not a bubble at all its jamming signals don 't stop at the edge of your personal space or at the edge of your car they go on to jam innocent gps receivers for miles around you laughter imagine for example the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble all of a sudden your gps readout goes blank and now it 's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it they don 't update or upkeep the only backup to gps was discontinued last year our modern society has a special relationship with gps we 're almost blindly reliant on it it 's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure some call it the invisible utility it might be deadly but as it turns out for purposes of protecting your privacy there 's something even more potent you imitate them and if you do it right the device you 're attacking doesn 't even know it 's being spoofed so let me show you how this works in any gps receiver there 's a peak inside that corresponds to the authentic signals these three red dots represent the tracking points that try to keep themselves centered on that peak but if you send in a fake and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned with the authentic peak getting forced off so is this really possible can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that with spoofer well they have no authentication they 're wide open vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack people figured that it would be too complex or too expensive for some hacker to build one but i and a friend of mine from graduate school we didn 't see it that way we knew it wasn 't going to be so hard and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing which means that i got a little extra help from my here 's ramon looking for a little attention from dad that week though we eventually got it packaged into a small box now the dr frankenstein moment when the spoofer finally came alive and i glimpsed its awful potential came late one let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment i had come to completely trust this little blue dot and its reassuring blue halo they seemed to speak to me they 'd say here you are here you are and you can trust us something felt very wrong about the world it was a sense almost of betrayal when this little blue dot started at my house and went running off toward the north leaving me behind i wasn 't moving what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos i saw airplanes and ships veering off course with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer it 's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots imagine for example you 're being tracked well you can play the tracker for a fool pretending to be at work when you 're really on vacation or if you 're carol you could lure your ex boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him so i 'm fascinated by this conflict looming conflict between privacy on the one hand given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot can you really blame people for wanting i hold out hope that we 'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of some yet you 'll never lose track of your things but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a gps spoofer or a wave bubble to protect your own privacy so as usual what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril it 'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out"
