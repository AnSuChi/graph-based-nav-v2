  "transcript": "there 's even a story of a girl who eloped with a i am a sexting expert not an expert sexter though i do know what this means i think you do too [ it 's a penis ] i have been studying sexting since the media attention to it began in two thousand and eight i and here 's what i found people are into all sorts of things that you may not be into like blue cheese or cilantro but as long as you 're not sending an image to someone who doesn 't want to receive it there 's no harm and instead of worrying about right now most people are thinking about sexting without really thinking about consent at all 17 year olds can legally have sex in most us states but they can 't photograph it some states have also tried passing sexting misdemeanor laws but these laws repeat the same problem because they still make consensual sexting illegal it doesn 't make sense to try to ban all sexting to try to address privacy violations this is kind of like saying let 's solve the problem of date rape by just making dating completely illegal but can you guess who does does it 's often teens who are disliked by their partner 's parents but some do according to researchers at the university of new hampshire seven percent of all child pornography possession arrests are teens sexting consensually with other teens parents and educators are also responding to sexting without really thinking too much about consent their message to teens is often right you 're probably thinking my kid would never sext and that 's true your little angel may not be sexting because only thirty three percent every study i 've seen puts the rate above fifty percent for 18 to 24 year olds and most of the time nothing goes wrong people ask me all the time things like isn 't sexting just so dangerous though it 's like if you come back the next day and all the money is just gone you really need to dump that guy so instead of criminalizing every new media technology raises privacy concerns in fact in the us the very first major debates about privacy were in response to technologies that were relatively new at the time which were just suddenly more portable than ever before they were worried that the camera would capture information about them take it out of context and widely disseminate it does this sound familiar it 's exactly but there are solutions and we 've been here before with a dangerous new technology traffic fatality rates were rising we could and we can do the same thing with digital privacy it comes back to consent this idea of affirmative consent comes from anti rape activists who tell us that we need consent for every sexual act and we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas think about having surgery your doctor has to make sure that you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure this is not the type of consent like with an itunes terms of service where you just scroll to the bottom and you 're like agree agree whatever if we think more about consent we can have better privacy laws right now we just don 't have that many protections if your a terrible person they can take your nude photos and upload them to a porn site and in a lot of states you 're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim laughter right now whether that 's an individual or a company or the nsa though you may not be successful because many courts assume that digital privacy is just impossible so they 're not willing to punish anyone for violating it i still hear people asking me all the time isn 't a digital image somehow blurring the line between public and private because it 's digital right no no everything digital is not just automatically public that doesn 't make any sense and it doesn 't make a difference if it 's digital or all of your health records are digitized but your doctor can 't just share them with anyone but one of the easiest things we can all do is make personal changes to help protect each other 's privacy constantly monitor and update your privacy settings we 're told never share anything you wouldn 't want the entire world to see this doesn princeton researcher janet vertesi argues our data and our privacy they 're not just personal they 're actually interpersonal if you want to forward an email thread ask for permission and if you want to share someone 's nude selfie obviously ask for permission these companies have very little incentive to help protect our privacy because their business models depend on us sharing everything with as many but what if i got to decide if that image was forwardable or not this would tell you you don 't have my permission to send this image out we do this kind of thing all the time to protect copyright so why not try this with mobile phones if we don 't think more about digital privacy and consent there can be he betrayed her and sent her photos around the entire school instead of being compassionate her classmates harassed her they called her a slut and a whore and they made her life miserable jennifer did nothing wrong all she did was share a nude photo with someone she thought that she could trust and yet yet our laws tell her that she committed a horrible crime equivalent to child pornography and when we assume that privacy is impossible in digital media we completely write off and excuse her boyfriend 's bad bad behavior people are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations what were you thinking you should have never sent that image and it didn 't end well i guess you shouldn 't have gone skiing then if we think more about consent we can see that victims of privacy violations deserve our compassion not criminalization shaming harassment or punishment support victims and we can prevent some privacy violations by making these legal individual and technological changes because the problem is not sexting the issue is digital privacy and one solution is consent so the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you thank you"
