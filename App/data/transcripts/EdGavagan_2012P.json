  "transcript": "you get dressed put on your shoes you head out into the world you plan on coming back getting undressed going to bed helps give us a structure to how we organize ourselves and our lives and gives it a measure of predictability living in new york city as i do it 's almost as if with so many people doing so many things at the same time time in such close quarters it 's almost like life is dealing you extra hands out of that deck you 're never there 's just juxtapositions are are possible that just aren 't you don 't think they 're going to happen and you never think you 're going to be the guy who 's walking down the because you choose to go down one side or the other the rest of your life is changed forever and one one night i 'm riding the uptown local train i get on i tend to be a little bit vigilant when i get on and i get on the car and i look and guy and a girl and they 're sitting next to each other and she 's got her leg draped over his knee and they 're doing they and they 're doing it with one hand they 're doing it left handed and right handed very quickly and then she 'll hand the thing to him and he 'll do never seen anything like this it 's almost like they 're practicing magic tricks and at the next stop a guy gets on the car and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him he 's got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches and and he starts to and and he 's the guy giving the lecture it 's going to be you know everything 's going to be happening at the same time it 's going to be and it 's just very important that you be able to do these beyond second nature each hand left right hand you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers and at that moment when i heard that i just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night when i had been getting a ride in an ambulance from the sidewalk where i had been stabbed to the trauma room of st vincent 's hospital in manhattan and what had happened was a and i happened and they jumped on me without a word one of the very lucky instinctively and he went in and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava if you know anything about anatomy that 's not a good thing to get cut and everything of course on the way up and then i still had my hands up he pulled it out and went for my neck and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck and i managed to by hitting that guy to get a minute i ran down the street and collapsed and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk and and one of the so i remember being on the stretcher and having a little cone of vision and i was moving my head around and we got to st vincent 's and we 're racing down this hallway and i see the lights going and it 's a peculiar effect of of memories like that they don 't really go to the usual place that memories go they kind of have this vault where they 're stored in high def and george lucas did all the sound effects it 's not like and i 'd been able to breathe a little more now because the the blood has left had been filling up my lungs and i was having a very hard time breathing but now it 's kind of gone into the stretcher and i said anything i can do to help and and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising and then i look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me and i think he looks bangladeshi and i just have those two facts and i just think this could work somehow and then i go i go out and and i needed about forty units of blood to keep me there while they did their work and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines my which i thought was great you know just a little tidy thing there at the end and and he had given me about a two percent chance of so he was there when i when i woke up and it was waking up was like breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain it was that and there was only one spot and he was holding the arch of my foot and and i looked up and he 's like good to see you and i and he said you know we didn 't cut your hair you might have gotten strength from your hair like samson and you 're going to need all the strength you can get and in those days my hair was down to my waist so those were different times but i had three days of life support the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn 't going to make it so it was three days of and when i finally pooped then that somehow surgically speaking that 's like you crossed some good line and um on that came in and whipped the sheet off of me he had three or four friends with him and he does that and they all look and there was no infection and they bend over me and they 're poking and prodding and they 're like there 's no hematomas blah blah look at the color and they 're talking amongst themselves and i 'm like this restored automobile that he 's just going yeah i did that these guys are high fiving him over and later on when i got out and the the flashbacks and the nightmares were giving me a hard time i went back to him and what am i gonna do and i think kind of as a surgeon he basically said you gotta get on with that it 's like i gave you a new car and you 're complaining about and the subway doors are closing and and i go i think to myself i 'm going to lift my shirt up this is the new york city subway that 's going to lead to other things and i feel my index finger in in the first scar that i ever got from my umbilical and i think that that chance encounter with those kids on the street with their knives led me to my surgical team and their training and skill and always a little bit of luck pushed back against chaos"
