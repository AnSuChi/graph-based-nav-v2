  "transcript": "but survive we have our primitive ancestors but at the same time distracted by our bread and circuses and embroiled in the wars that we have waged on each other it seems that we have forgotten this desire to explore we as a species uniquely and so content are we with our living conditions that we have grown complacent while mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel few of us seem to truly realize that our species ' fragile constitution let us take a trek to your local national forest for a quick reality check so just a quick show of hands here how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few how about a few weeks that 's a decent amount how about a few months that 's pretty good too now let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter same questions how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days so for a fun twist let us imagine that the source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like mars so how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet and how do we grow things like food that grew up on earth like us but i 'm getting ahead of myself in our species ' journey to find a new home under a new sun we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself in space on a ship a hermetic flying can the longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of twelve to fourteen months we know that spending time in a microgravity environment cardiovascular problems among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological and what about macrogravity or any other variation in gravitational pull of the planet that we find ourselves on in short our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown wonderful as they are i believe the time has come for us to complement the field of study that has enabled us vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body microscopic or not with incredible speed and fidelity given the limitations of synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food our fuel and our environment but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space the martian soil composition is similar to that of hawaiian volcanic ash with trace amounts of organic material hypothetically what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using earth derived nutrients the first question we should probably ask is how would we make our plants cold tolerant the next question we should ask is how do we make our plants most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than i can say the word evaporate well it turns out we 've already done things like this by borrowing genes for anti freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes or genetically modified organisms and we rely on them to feed all the mouths of human civilization nature we have simply found more precise ways to do it well to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all it 's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high cost cargo transport mission one of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments in essence using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term these organisms can then also be engineered to make medicine or fuel so we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us but what else can we do well i mentioned earlier that that we as a species were evolved uniquely for planet earth that fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and i was standing there even given ample food water air we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight or needing to hide behind a wall of lead so let us appeal to nature for inspiration it is known to be able to withstand cold radiation tolerance mechanisms are known we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals to do so is not particularly easy there are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance and it 's not as simple as transferring one gene but given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time i think to do so is not very even if we borrow just a fraction using the tools of synthetic biology we can harness deinococcus radiodurans ' ability to thrive under otherwise very lethal doses of radiation homo sapiens the chemical element that can kill the average human being the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations such evolution requires two things that we may not always have or be able to afford and they are death and time in our species ' struggle to find our place in the universe we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on on non earth planets we 're living in what e o wilson has termed the age of gene circumvention we approach the age of volitional evolution augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how but of when using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms especially our own is not without its moral and ethical quandaries will engineering ourselves make us less human but then again what is humanity but star stuff that happens to be conscious surely it is a bit of a waste to sit back and marvel at it how do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves i pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us we must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage but it will not be our last our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species ' improbable intelligence space is cold brutal and unforgiving our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going thank you"
