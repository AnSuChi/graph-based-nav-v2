  "transcript": "what is going to be the future of learning i do have a plan but in order for me to tell you what that plan is i need to tell you a little story which kind of sets the stage tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools where did it come from and you can look far back into the past but if you look at present day schooling the way it is it 's quite easy to figure out where it came from it came from about three hundred years but the victorians actually did it what did was amazing they created a global computer it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine in order to have that machine running you need lots and lots of people they made another machine to produce those people the school the schools would produce the people they must be because the data is handwritten they must be so identical that you could pick one up from new zealand and ship them to canada and he would be they engineered a system that was so robust continuously producing identical people so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything what are the kind of jobs that we have today well the clerks are the computers they 're there in thousands in every office and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs they don 't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads they do need to be able to read in fact they need to be able to read discerningly well whenever they want in whatever way they want present day schooling going to prepare them for that world well i bumped into this whole thing completely by accident and right next to where i used to work there was slum and i used to think how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs or should they not i think he 's gifted so i suddenly figured that how come all the rich people are having these extraordinarily gifted children i made a hole in the in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if i gave a computer to children who never would have one didn 't know any english internet was the children came running in it was three feet off the ground simple solution one of your students must have been passing by showed them how to use the mouse so i said yeah that 's possible so i repeated the experiment i went three hundred miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software development engineer was very little when they saw me they said we want a faster processor and a better mouse laughter so i said how on earth do you know all this and they said something very interesting to me in irritated voice they said you 've given us a machine that works only in english so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it that 's the first time as a teacher that i had heard the word teach ourselves said so casually here 's a short glimpse from those years that 's the first day at the hole in the wall on your right is an she 's six and then onto getting exactly the same results that we were and finally a girl explaining in marathi what it is and said there 's a processor inside i published everywhere i down and measured everything and i said in nine months a group of children left alone with a computer in any language among them for example and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs i gave them a and i said keep talking into it until it types what you say reason i ended with the face of this young lady over there is because i suspect many of you know her she has now joined a call center in hyderabad and may have tortured you about your credit card bills in a very clear english accent so then how far will it go where does it stop i decided i would i would destroy my own argument i made a hypothesis a ridiculous hypothesis tamil is a south indian language and i said can tamil speaking children in a south indian village learn the biotechnology of dna replication in english from a streetside computer we need teachers i found a village it was called kallikuppam in southern india most of which i didn 't understand the children came rushing 's all this so i said it 's very topical very important but it 's all in english so they said how can we understand such big english words and diagrams and chemistry so by now i had developed a new pedagogical method so i applied that i said i came back after two months and the children trooped in and said we 've understood nothing so i said well what did i expect so i said okay but how long did it take you before you she raised her hand and she says to me in broken tamil and english she said apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes disease we haven 't understood anything else absurd but thirty percent is a fail what i did find was a friend that they had a 22 year old girl who was an accountant so i asked this girl can you help them so she says absolutely not i didn 't have science in school i have no idea what they 're doing under that tree all day long i can 't help you i said i 'll tell you what use the method of the grandmother gosh when i was your age i could have never done that ' you know what grannies do so she did that for two more months the scores jumped to fifty percent kallikuppam had caught up with my control school in new delhi a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher when i saw that graph i knew here 's kallikuppam i got the camera angle wrong that one is just amateur stuff but what she was saying as you could make out was about neurons with her hands were like that and she was saying neurons communicate children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to to pick up their books with their what will it be tomorrow could it be that we don 't need to go to school at all could it be that at the point in time when you need to know something you can find out in two minutes could it be a devastating question question that was framed for me by nicholas negroponte could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in a future where knowing is obsolete but look at it this way it took nature one hundred million years to make the ape stand up what an achievement that is but we have to integrate that into our own future if you look at kuppam if you look at all of the experiments that i did it was simply saying wow saluting learning the reptilian part of our brain which sits in the center of our brain it shuts all of that down we make them shut their brains down and then we say perform because it was needed there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people what happens to creativity in our age we need to shift that balance back back from threat i came back to england i put out notices in papers saying if you are a british grandmother if you have broadband and a web camera i got two hundred in the first two weeks i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe the granny cloud sits on the internet if there 's a child in in trouble we beam a gran she deep she does it with only one i think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self organize then learning the teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens i think that 's what all this is pointing at but how will we know how will we come to know well i intend to build these and teachers sort of it happens by itself how did you know that i said you won 't believe the children who told me and where they 're from here 's a sole in action he maintains law and order a decade ahead of her time i think we need a curriculum of big questions you already heard about that you know what what that means there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say what are those twinkling lights but that that 's not sexy enough if a meteorite was coming to hit the earth how would you figure out if it was going to or not and if he says well what how you say there 's a magic word it 's called the tangent of an angle and leave him alone he 'll figure it out this one is about what happens to the air we breathe this is done by children without the help so what 's my wish my wish is that we design the future of learning we don 't want to be spare parts for a great human computer do we so we need to design my wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world it will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in the way i want to do this it 's a facility which is practically unmanned there 's only one granny it 's very easy to do there 's a great document produced by ted which tells you how to do it if you would please please do it across all five continents and create the future of learning that 's my wish and just one last thing i 'll take you to the top of the himalayas i once built i don 't know what should i do and i was trying to take a picture of her she suddenly raised her hand like this get on with it"
