  "transcript": "into a hotel in manhattan and assassinated rabbi meir kahane the leader of the jewish defense league nosair was initially found not guilty sadly bombing of the world trade center was not nosair would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot and a loving american mother and grade school teacher who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me it wasn 't until i was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change my father exposed me to a side of islam that few people including the majority of muslims get to see it we all want the same things out of life in every religion in every population you 'll find a small percentage of people who hold so fervently to their beliefs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do a few months prior to his arrest he sat me down and explained that for the past few weekends he and some friends he told me i 'd be going with him the next morning we arrived at calverton shooting range which unbeknownst to our group was being watched by the fbi when it was my turn to shoot my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about thirty yards off that day the last bullet i shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone 's surprise especially mine the entire target burst into flames my uncle turned to the other men and in arabic said ibn abuh like father like son but it wasn 't until a few years later that i fully understood what they thought was so funny they thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of these were the men i looked up to these were the men i called ammu which means uncle each time i would begin to feel comfortable around someone it was time to pack up and move to the next town being the perpetual new face in class i was frequently the target of i kept my identity a secret from my classmates to avoid being targeted but as it turns out being the quiet chubby new kid in class was more than enough ammunition so for the most part i spent my time at home reading books and watching tv or playing video games and growing up in a bigoted household i wasn 't prepared for the real world been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements like a person 's race or religion so what opened my eyes i was able to take part in the national youth convention in philadelphia my particular group 's focus was on youth violence and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life this was a subject in which i felt particularly passionate one day toward the end of the convention i found out that one of the kids i had befriended was jewish now it had taken several days for this detail to come to light and i realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us and frankly i felt a sense of pride in having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life i had been led to believe was insurmountable another major turning point came when i found a summer job at busch gardens an amusement park there i was exposed and that experience proved to be fundamental to the development of my character and by extension that all gay people were a negative influence least judgmental people i had ever met being bullied as a kid and it comes very unnaturally to me to treat people who are kind because of that feeling i was able to contrast the stereotypes i 'd been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction i don 't know what it 's like to be gay then there was the daily show on a nightly basis jon stewart forced me to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry and helped me to realize that a person 's race religion or sexual orientation had nothing to do with the quality of one 's character he was and the fact that a jewish comedian had done more to positively influence my worldview than my own extremist father is not lost on me one day i had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview was starting to change and she said something to me that i will hold dear to my heart for as long as i live she looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who had experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime and said i 'm tired of hating people in that instant i realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that hatred inside of you so why would i out myself and potentially put myself in danger i do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday who is compelled to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way intolerant ideology that i did not become fanaticized instead i choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism i do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives and with that simple fact i stand here as proof that and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father thank you"
