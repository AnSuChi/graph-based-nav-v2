  "transcript": "am one of the two billion people on earth and there are days i don 't know about the rest of you but there are days palpably feel but what i 'm here to talk to you about today is how that same interdependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually harness to help heal some a couple of years ago i read an article by new york times writer michael pollan in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment now at the time that i was reading this it was the middle of the winter and i definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my new york city apartment so i was basically but that was actually exactly the point that michael pollan was making in this article it 's precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system and that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield high quality liquid soil over plants ' root systems now to a vegetable plant my apartment has got to be about as but i can offer some natural light and year round climate control and the way it works is that there 's a pump at the bottom which periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top which then trickles down through plants ' root systems that are suspended in clay pellets so there 's no dirt involved and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm and whether she is going to feed her back at the time a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing and i really wanted it to be an open project because hydroponics is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting in the united states right now and could possibly become another area like monsanto where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people 's food so i decided that instead of creating a product what i was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers all kinds of stuff but the first few systems were these that martha stewart would definitely never have approved so actually now on this and we have window farms all over the world or research and development but what we call it is r tony in chicago has been taking on growing experiments like lots of other window farmers and he 's been able to get his strawberries to fruit for nine months of the year in low light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutrients and window and with every open source project so my core team and i are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone so for very and to fund the project we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don 't have time to build their own systems now within our community a certain culture has appeared in our culture it is better to be a tester who supports someone else 's idea than it is to be just the idea guy but i think that eleen expresses best what we really get out of this which is the actual joy of collaboration if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we 're all talking about as environmentalists and and food people maybe we just need to ditch the term consumer and get behind the people who are doing stuff open source projects tend to have a momentum of their and we 're looking ahead at generations who really need us to retool our lives now so we ask that you join us in rediscovering the value of citizens united and to declare that we are all still pioneers"
