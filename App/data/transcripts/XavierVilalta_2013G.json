  "transcript": "my work focuses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment today i brought two recent projects as an example of this and also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture and this is the type of building we were shown as an example to my team and myself of what we had to design at first the first thing i thought was i want to run away after seeing a few of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that they have three very big points first these buildings they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things and then you need a lot of cooling in a city where this shouldn 't happen because they have really mild weather and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions also during our first visit to ethiopia i was really captivated by the old merkato that is this open air structure and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors so i thought this is the next challenge was when we looked at the site that is in a really growing area of the city where most of these buildings that so the first thing and this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain and around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops that change in each floor because of the shape of the void and i really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in and then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the ethiopian women 's dresses that they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade and we are building that with these these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like and also that the idea of the facade and the first implementation was to think about how we and then under those panels and these porches on the roof all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside the second example is a master plan the biggest project i 've ever designed i really needed to understand the city of tunis but also its surroundings during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this the first design operation we did creating twelve initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona other cities in europe with these courtyards on top of that we selected some strategic points and for that i thought what would be the best orientation and it because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural ventilation and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor and the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by a series of commercial [ spaces ] that bring activity to the ground floor and do activities such as having a two kilometer run in the morning jumping from one building to another and also they are in emerging countries where you can see the these cities the impact of architecture in people 's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow for this reason i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions thank you very much"
