  "transcript": "years old when i saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life that was a great day for my mother and the first day it was going to be used even grandma grandma was invited to see the machine throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood and she had hand washed laundry for seven children and now she was going to watch electricity do that work my mother let me push the button give me a chair i want to see it and she sat down in front of the machine and she watched the entire washing program she was mesmerized today in sweden and other rich countries people are using so many so many different machines look the homes are full of machines i can 't even name them all and they also when they and they cook their food on fire sometimes they don 't even have enough food and they live below the poverty line there are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day the richest people over there there 's one billion people and they live above what i call the air line $ eighty a day on their consumption but this is just one two three billion people and obviously there are seven billion people in the world so there must be one two three and today there 's an additional one billion people out there who live above the wash line so two billion have access to washing machines and the remaining five billion how do they wash how do most of the women in the world wash because it remains hard work for women to wash by hand they don 't want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity and there 's nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma look here two generations ago in sweden picking water from the stream heating with firewood and washing like that but when i lecture to students they tell me no everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines how can we tell this woman that she and then i ask my students i 've asked them over the last two years i 've asked how many of you doesn 't use a car and some of them proudly raise their hand and say i don 't use a car and then i put the really tough question how many of you hand wash your jeans and your bed sheets and no one raised their hand even the hardcore in the green movement something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it what is special with this i had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world here we are look here you see the seven billion the bulb people and the fire people of electricity and the energy in the world is and it 's twelve units used in the entire world and the richest one billion they use six of them they use two this group uses three one each and they also have electricity and over there they don 't even use one each that makes twelve of them but the main concern for what are the trends if we just prolong the trends without any real advanced analysis to two thousand and fifty there are two things that can increase the energy use first population economic growth population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman and [ with ] that you will get two extra but that won 't change the energy use the best of here in the emerging economies i call them the new east they will jump the air line wopp they will say and they will start to use as much and these people they want the washing machine i told you they 'll go there and they will double their energy use and we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light and they 'll get a two child but the total energy consumption will increase to twenty two units and these units still the richest people use most of it so what needs to be done because the risk the high probability of climate change is real it 's real of course they must be more they must also start to produce green energy much more green energy but until they have the same energy consumption per person they shouldn 't give advice to others what to do and what not to do and she became dilma rousseff the of one of the biggest democracies in the and what 's the magic with them my mother explained the magic with this machine the very very first day she said now we have loaded the laundry the machine will make the work and now we can go to the library you get books she loved this i got the abc 's this is where i started my career as a professor when my mother had and she read so many novels so many different novels here thank you and thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books thank you very much"
