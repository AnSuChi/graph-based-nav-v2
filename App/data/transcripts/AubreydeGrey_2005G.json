  "transcript": "eighteen minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit so i 'm going to dive straight in right at the point where i get this thing to work here we i 'm going to talk about why we have to get actually talk about this a bit more than we do i 'm going to talk about feasibility as well of course i 'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging and then i 'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about i 'm going to do that in two steps the first one i 'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension which i 'm going to define thirty years applied to people who are already in middle age when you start to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging namely essentially an elimination of the and of course the last thing i 'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step that point of maybe thirty years life extension so i 'm going to start with i want to ask a question hands up anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ok so we all think malaria is a bad thing that 's very good news because i thought that was what the answer would be now the thing is i would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging and here is that characteristic considerably more people than malaria does now i like in an audience in britain especially to talk about the comparison with foxhunting which is something that was banned after a long struggle by the government not very many months ago i mean i know i 'm with a and this is actually a rather good comparison it seems to me you know a lot of people said well you know city boys have no business telling us telling us rural types what to do with our time it 's a traditional part of the way of life and we should be allowed to carry on doing it it 's ecologically sound it stops the population explosion of foxes but ultimately the government prevailed in the end because the majority of the british public and certainly the majority of members of parliament and i think that human aging shares it 's not just about life of course you know so really this is how i would like to describe it it 's a global trance and i mean ok i 'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless there are some good points to be made here things that we ought but these are completely crazy when you actually these are arguments these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about but the question is are they are these so bad that they outweigh condemning one hundred thousand people a day to an unnecessarily early death you know if you haven 't got an argument that 's that strong then just don 't waste my time is what i say laughter now there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong and here it is people worry about overpopulation die to speak of or at least the death toll is going to be much lower only from crossing st giles carelessly and therefore we 're not going to be able to have many kids and kids are really important to most people and that 's true we will have to decide whether to have and i say that that 's fine the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice what 's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future if we vacillate but will not be because we haven 't developed them as quickly as we could we 'll be denying those people an indefinite life span and i consider that that is immoral right so the next thing is now why should we get a little bit more active on this and the fundamental answer is that the pro aging trance is not as dumb as it looks you know we 've got to find some way to put it out of our minds and it 's rational to like for example making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all but of course that only works when we have both of these components and as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear and we might be in range of doing something about aging this becomes part of the problem this pro aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things and that 's why we have to really talk about this a lot evangelize i will go so far as to say quite a lot in order to get people 's attention and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard i 'm going to say about that i 'm now going to talk about and the fundamental reason i think metabolism this is not a completely tautological statement it 's a reasonable statement aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars and it also happens to us despite the fact that we have a lot of clever so basically metabolism which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next according to most people with regard to postponing aging they 're what i 'm calling here the gerontology approach and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time and stop the accumulation of side effects from because the we 've discovered things like for example interference only a few years ago and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work basically gerontology is a fine approach in the end but it is not an approach whose time has come when we 're talking about intervention so then but it isn 't before i tell you why it isn 't i 'm going to go a little bit into what i 'm calling step two as i said that we do acquire let 's say we do it today for the sake of argument the ability to confer thirty extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age let 's what would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today or equivalently of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive would actually live in and the reason it 's the wrong answer is because of progress there are they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames and it took us until one thousand nine hundred and three to actually work out how to do it i think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight we can think really that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one if you like the incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore this is the sort of thing you see after you can look at medical care i mean hygiene vaccines antibiotics so i think that actually step two that i called a step a moment ago isn 't a step at all though those people are already middle aged when the therapies arrive they will be staying ahead of the game the therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us this is a very important point for me to get across people when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to one thousand or more they think that i 'm saying that we 're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so but we 'll be able to fix the things that before we have any 200 year olds and the same for three hundred and four hundred and so on i decided to give this a little name which is longevity escape velocity it seems to get the point across so these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to to live in terms of remaining life as measured by their health for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive if you 're already one hundred or even if you 're eighty and an average 80 year old we probably can 't do a lot for you with these therapies because you 're too close to death 's door for the really initial experimental therapies to be good enough for you you won 't be able to withstand them but if you 're only fifty then there 's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense in terms of your youthfulness both physical and mental and in terms of your risk of death from age related causes and of course age related causes so this is a genuine conclusion that i come to that the first 150 year old we don 't know how old that person is today because we don 't know how long i 'm claiming that the first person to live to one thousand subject of course to you know global catastrophes is actually probably only about ten years younger than the first 150 year old and that 's quite a thought alright so finally i 'm going to spend the rest of the talk my last seven and a half minutes on step one namely how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to and in order to do that i need to talk about mice a little bit and this is what it is i say we 're going to take a long lived strain of mouse which basically means mice that live about three years on average we do exactly nothing to them until they 're already two years old and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them and with those therapies the question then is what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone i talked about earlier for humans which we can now as i 've explained equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape and and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more i say that 's nonsense i say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this we need to give our best guess as to the time frame in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can so i say that we have a fifty fifty chance of reaching this rhr milestone robust human rejuvenation within fifteen years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation fifteen years from the robust mouse the public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that the public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are so they 'll probably think it 's five years away they 'll be wrong but that actually won 't matter too much that will be history at this point because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans since it 's been so in order to tell you now how we 're going to get these mice i 'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging i 'm going to use this word damage to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes and this turns out to be useful because we can re draw our original diagram this way we can say that fundamentally the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology and i 'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology and the reason it 's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate if we look at it this way we can call it the engineering approach and i claim that the engineering approach is and it 's something that we are within range of being able to do because it doesn 't involve improving on evolution engineering approach simply says let 's go and and periodically repair all of these various types of damage not necessarily repair them completely but repair them quite a lot so that we keep the level because we don 't get age related diseases until we 're in middle age even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another this list is just for illustration it is incomplete the list on the right is also incomplete it 's a list of types of pathology that are just an incomplete list but i would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage side effects of metabolism that cause and there are only seven of them mutations in chromosomes mutations in the mitochondria and so on like to give you an argument for why that list is complete what can damage accumulate in the answer is long lived molecules so these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty i haven 't got time to go through them at all but and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have you may have been dissatisfied with this talk but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff i 've published a great deal on this i cite and of course the main thing is that you shouldn 't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field so you know you 've got to actually do your homework in order to understand whether this is true and we 'll just end with a few things one thing is you know you 'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone said well it 's obviously impossible and which is basically an incentive to innovate and to do there 's a proposal to actually ok it 's got to be philanthropic because profits distract biotech but got a ninety percent chance i think of succeeding in this and i think we know how to do it and i 'll stop there i am actually one hundred and fifty eight audience species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate however as far as so when cells divide the telomerase get shorter and eventually species die so why does evolution has seems to have selected against immortality when it is so advantageous or is evolution just incomplete ag i 'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question which happen to agree with and that carries on being true the longer you push it out so to the extent that evolution doesn 't matter doesn 't care whether genes are passed on by individuals living a long time or by procreation amount of modulation of that which is why different species have different but that 's why there are no immortal species ca the genes don 't care but we do ag that 's right audience the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by ten i project that that would make me think that i would live until one hundred and twenty if i don 't crash on my motorbike that means that i 'm one of your subjects to become a 1 000 year old ag if you your numbers are a bit out the standard numbers are that lifespans it 's not quite as good as you might think you might hope but i intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible audience i was told that and that the brain cells last eighty years or so if that is indeed true biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation if there are cells in my body that live all eighty as opposed to a typical you know couple of months"
