  "transcript": "but he he taught me to never presume anything about anyone you don 't know on a thursday morning in july two thousand and five apparently i didn 't see him actually i didn 't see anyone you know not to look at anyone on the tube but i guess he saw me i guess he looked at all of us what was he thinking i know it wasn 't personal he didn 't set out to kill or maim me gill hicks i mean he didn 't know me instead he gave me an unwarranted allowed him to dehumanize us it allowed him to push and i was almost one of them in the time it takes to draw a breath what i imagine wading through tar might be like we didn 't know we were the enemy no direct eye contact no talking but in the lifting of the darkness we were reaching out we were helping each other waiting for responses but i listened for her but it mattered to me that he survived all i shared with them and here is my also rescued from that morning they didn 't know that i published architecture and design journals that i was a fellow of the royal society of arts that i wore black still do that i smoked cigarillos i drank gin and i watched ted talks of course never dreaming that one day i i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london and i wasn 't ready for that all to end i was so determined to survive that i used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my and i just shut everything and everyone out i lowered my breathing rate i held myself upright and i fought the urge to close my eyes perhaps dancing taken up but my priority i lived to work who i was on my business card mattered to me but it didn 't matter down in that tunnel by the time i felt that first touch from one of my rescuers i was unable speak unable to say even a small word like gill i understood just who and what humanity really is when i first saw and it read difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go to save my life to save as many unknowns as they could and putting their own lives at risk to them it didn 't matter whether i was male or female my sexual orientation who i voted for whether i was educated if i had a faith or no faith at all nothing i see myself i am proof that unconditional love and respect can not only save but it can transform lives throughout all the chaos my hand was held tightly my face was stroked gently what did i feel what 's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution what 's given me the courage to say this ends with me is love i was loved potential for widespread positive change is absolutely enormous because i know what we 're capable of i know the brilliance of humanity so this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder and some questions for us all to consider is what unites us not far greater does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster for us to feel deeply connected as one species and when will we embrace the wisdom of our era to rise above mere tolerance and move to an acceptance for all thank you"
