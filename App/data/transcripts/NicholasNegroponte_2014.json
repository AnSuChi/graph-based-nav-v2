  "transcript": "we switch to the video disc which is in play mode i 'm really interested in how you put people and computers together we will be using the tv screens there is another way where computers touch people wearing chronologically the and all i noticed was my bald spot getting bigger imagine seeing so what i 'm going to do in my time is try and share with you what happened during the thirty years and then and i put on a slide where ted one happened in my life and it 's rather important but there are a couple of things about that period and about what happened that are really quite important one is that it was a period when computers weren 't yet for people and the other thing that sort of happened during that time is that we were considered sissy computer so i 'm going to characterize the years and i 'm even going to go back to some very early work of mine and this was the kind of stuff i was doing in the ' 60s very direct manipulation very influenced as i studied architecture by the architect moshe safdie and you can see that we even built robotic things that could build habitat like structures and this for me was and i pick fingers partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous papers were published about how stupid it was to use fingers three reasons one was they were and this was a device we built in the ' 70s which has never even been picked up it 's not just touch sensitive was to sort of do interface concurrently so when you talked and you pointed and you had if you will multiple and the israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue they did it partly because they had practiced on a physical model of the airport and when they arrived at entebbe they knew where to go because they had actually been there you get a contract department of and again this is ' seventy six and so you have google maps make sure your president if you were stopped for speeding and this is a cute actually device lenticular sheet with his photograph it would be in lip sync with zero bandwidth it was a zero bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time so again not generally accepted and that created the media lab one of the things about age is and the reason i say that is how many times in my life have i said oh in ten years this will happen and then ten years comes and then you say and one of the things that is most quoted that i 've ever said is that computing is not about computers didn 't quite get enough traction and then it started to this is a student of mine who had done a backseat driver it when to turn right when to turn left and so on turns out there are a lot of things in those instructions that back in that period were pretty challenging like what does it mean take the next right well and the mit patent office said don 't patent it it the liabilities are too large there will be insurance issues don 't patent it so we didn 't don 't really look what 's happening yo yo ma and tracking his body for playing the cello or the hypercello these fellows literally walked around like that at the time and then there are at least three heroes i want to quickly mention marvin minsky and i will talk briefly about muriel cooper who was very important to ricky wurman and to ted and in fact when she got onstage she said the first thing she said was i introduced ricky to nicky and nobody calls me nicky and nobody calls richard ricky so nobody knew who she was talking about and then of course seymour papert who is the person who said you can 't think about thinking unless you think about thinking about something and that 's actually you can unpack that later it 's a pretty profound pretty profound statement i 'm showing some some slides that were from ted two a little silly as slides perhaps then i felt television really was about displays again now we 're past ted one i look today the oven panel and put it on your cell phone or the door key onto your cell phone just taking it and bringing it to you and in fact that 's actually what you don 't want you want to put a chicken and the oven says aha it 's a chicken and it cooks the chicken oh it 's cooking the chicken for nicholas and he likes it this way and that way so the not a particularly enlightened view of the internet of things television again television what i said today that was back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and the television of tomorrow would look something like that again people decided that he would call this diagram the negroponte switch i 'm but the idea of things that came in the ground would go in the air and stuff in the air would go into the ground has played itself out that is the original slide and it has worked in lockstep obedience we started wired magazine some people i remember we shared the reception desk periodically and some parent called up irate and he said are you some porno magazine or something and couldn 't understand why his son would be interested in wired at any rate i will go through this a little quicker this is you at least it gives me pleasure when somebody says how dead wrong you are and it also allowed us to build the new media lab which if you it was the party that ricky wurman never had and then something for me changed i became more involved with computers and learning and influenced by seymour but particularly looking at learning you 've got to and that iteration is so that led to my own work with seymour in places like cambodia and the starting of one laptop per child enough ted talks on one laptop per child so i 'll go through it very fast but it did it did give us the chance to do something at a relatively large scale in the area of learning development and computing and it was at least over the seven years i ran it but even more important the world bank contributed zero so these are the various places it happened and here 's the experiment the experiment is can learning happen where there are no schools and we dropped off tablets with no instructions and let the children figure it out and in a short period of time they not only turned them on and were using fifty apps per child within five days they were singing but they hacked android and so that seemed sufficiently interesting this is perhaps the best picture i have the kid on your right has sort of nominated himself as teacher look at the kid on the left and so on there are no no adults involved in this at all so i said well can we do this at a larger scale and what is it that 's missing the and here 's the question i think the challenge is to connect the last billion people and connecting the last billion but the last billion are rural being and the people in that community are not poor but and the and so my plan and unfortunately i haven 't been able to get my partners at this point to let me announce them but is to do this with a stationary satellite but there are a lot of reasons why they are and for two billion dollars you can connect a lot more than one and i will leave this as my last slide is two billion dollars is what we were spending so surely if we can connect africa and the last billion people for numbers like that we should be doing thank you very much we have been doing a lot of consuming of information going through our eyes and so that may be a very inefficient channel so my prediction is that we are going to ingest information so once it 's in your bloodstream it basically goes through it and gets into the brain and when it knows that it 's in the brain in the different pieces so it 's ingesting ca have you been hanging out with ray kurzweil and there are a number of people this isn 't quite as far fetched so well thank you for that nicholas negroponte"
