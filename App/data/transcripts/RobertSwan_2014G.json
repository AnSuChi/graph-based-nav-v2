  "transcript": "let 's go south this is the direction of and if you go eight thousand kilometers the pole itself now i am not an explorer i 'm not an environmentalist i 'm actually just a and these photographs that i 'm showing you here are dangerous they are the ice melt of the south and ladies and gentlemen we need to listen we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet i have faced these places and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that 's ever happened to me antarctica is such a hopeful place it is protected by the antarctic treaty signed in ladies and gentlemen people already far up north from here in the arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice for the last ten twenty thirty thousand one hundred thousand years can they not join the dots and think why is the ice actually melting and i have worked hard for the last years cannot happen where did this all begin it began for me at the age of eleven check out that haircut it 's a bit odd and at i found it incredibly inspiring that the idea of becoming a polar traveler went down pretty well with girls at parties seven years of being told by my family eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the south geographic pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on earth in history in this photograph we are standing in an area the size of the united states of america and we 're on our own we have no radio communications no backup ninety percent of all the world 's ice seventy percent of all the world 's fresh water we 're standing on it this is the power intense cold so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing your teeth can crack water can freeze in your eyes let 's just say it 's a bit chilly but something happened to me on that 70 day journey in and it hurt in seventy days through damage our faces blistered out the skin ripped off and and when we got home we were told by nasa that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the south pole and we 'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean it was desperately cold again here 's me coming and if anybody ever says to you disaster strikes and we 're one thousand kilometers from grinding and i 'm thinking realized we as a world are in a survival situation and that feeling has never gone away for twenty five long years back then we had to march it 's life or death and our brave daryl who would become the first american to walk to the north pole his heel dropped off from frostbite two hundred klicks out he must keep going i became very low to succeed at something is often harder financially destroyed but hope came in the form of the great jacques cousteau and he inspired me to take on the and above all rob for the world leaders we 've been to every world earth summit all three of them with our brave yacht we made the longest thirteen thousand kilometers around the whole of southern africa doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person about we have taken over one thousand people people from industry and business women and men from companies students from all over the world down to antarctica and i 'm so proud of it because i have been inspired ever since i could walk to recycle by my mum here she is and my mum my mum is still recycling and as she is in her when mum was born the population of our planet was only one point eight billion people these are nations and will be hugely important in the decision about we 've engaged and inspired women to come from the middle east often fantastic people so inspired to look after antarctica you 've got and i 've been times in my life and all those people who come with us return home as great champions not only for but for local issues back in their own nations let 's go back to where we began the ice melt of the north and south poles and it 's not good news nasa informed us six months ago that the western antarctic ice shelf is now disintegrating huge areas of ice look how big antarctica is even compared to here and nasa have calculated it is definite by one meter in the next one hundred years the same time that my mum has been on planet earth it 's going to happen and i 've realized that the preservation of antarctica and there is a very simple solution if we are using more renewable energy in the real world if we are being more efficient with the energy there will be no financial reason we also may be able to slow down we 've got to go back and retrace our steps six hundred kilometers hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue he is coming with me he is committed to walking side by side with his father father and what he will do is to translate these messages and inspire these messages ladies and gentlemen a survivor and i 'm good a survivor sees a problem and doesn 't go we have we all have responsibility and i 'll leave you with these words i 've tried to live by them if you can do or dream you can begin it now for boldness has genius power thank you very much"
