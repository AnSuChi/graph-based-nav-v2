  "transcript": "i was pre med at the time and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity at the same time i fell in love with new york city so eventually i decided to pursue an instead of an m d and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city in new york city rats are part of commuters ' daily lives most people ignore them or are frightened of them but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society and even though they 're used in labs to promote i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them one day in the subway i was snapping pictures of the tracks hoping to catch a rat or two and a man came up to me and said you can 't take photographs i was quite shocked by that and ok then i 'll follow the rats then i started going into the tunnels which made me realize that there 's a whole new dimension to the city that i never saw before and most people don 't get to see around the same time i met like minded individuals who call themselves i was welcomed into this loose internet based network of people who regularly explore urban ruins such as abandoned subway stations tunnels sewers simply documenting these structures wasn 't enough for me so i wanted to create a fictional character or an animal that dwells in these and the simplest way to do it at the time was to model myself i wanted a simple way to represent a living body inhabiting these decaying derelict this was taken in the riviera sugar factory in red hook brooklyn it 's now an empty i was very fond of this space because it 's the first massive industrial complex i found on my own that is abandoned when i first went in i was scared because i heard dogs barking and i thought they were guard dogs but they happened to be wild dogs living there and it was right by the water there were swans and ducks swimming around and the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex and in a way i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature when i got comfortable in the space it also felt like a big playground i would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if i went back in time and became a child again the construction began in i love feeling the aura of instead of looking at reproductions of it at home you 're actually feeling the hand laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and the murals were done by a graffiti artist to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people that got relocated from the tunnel in one thousand nine when the tunnel reopened for trains walking in this tunnel is very peaceful there 's nobody around you and i was feeling a lot of and i decided to title my series naked city spleen references charles baudelaire naked city is a nickname for new york and spleen embodies the melancholia and inertia this is the same tunnel you see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts and the train approaching i was really frightened at first but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didn 't seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on was done he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out it must have been a very unusual day for him one thing that struck me after this incident was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city that homeless man to me really represented an element of the unconscious of the city he told me that he was abused above ground and was once in riker 's island and at last he found peace and quiet in that space but is now a sanctuary for the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project this particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of bloomingdale insane asylum which was demolished in one thousand eight hundred and ninety when columbia moved in this is the new york city farm colony which was a poorhouse in staten island from this children 's hospital was closed in morgue after exploring your home your office a shopping mall i was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is and how vulnerable people truly are this was taken under a homeless asylum built in i was on the train and i got off at the next station and met people there that gave me access to their catacomb like basement which was used for ammunition storage and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum the first tunnels date back to sixty b c they were consistently dug as 18th century of some of these quarries posed safety threats so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place and at the same time there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries so the bones were moved from the this was taken under the montparnasse cemetery where most of the are located there are also phone cables that were used in the ' 50s this is a german bunker and the whole tunnel system is so complex that which victor hugo wrote about in les miserables and i saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s like this one after exploring the underground of paris i decided to climb up and i climbed a gothic monument that 's right in the middle of paris it was built in the early i don 't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of january naked i never saw a single rat in any of these places this was probably the toughest place to explore i had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes this is a still from a film i worked on recently film gave a different feel to it i adapted and produced a dream play by august which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world built in the last place i visited was the mayan ruins of copan this was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple"
