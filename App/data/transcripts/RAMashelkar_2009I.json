  "transcript": "what we don 't look for is value for many while we are generating value for money what are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many we have described here in terms of the performance and you can get a mercedes for a very very high performance what happens well you are to ride a bicycle carrying your own weight and also some other weight so that you can earn well poor do not remain poor they become they don 't get much value because they can 't afford anything more than the issue is at that price can you give them some extra value a super value in terms of their ability to ride in a car to get that dignity to get that safety looks this is something that we see on indian streets but many people see the same the great thing about our leaders is that which practically all of them have they 're also very innovative an innovator is one who does not know it cannot but great leaders like ratan have compassion and what you said lakshmi is absolutely true it 's not just ratan tata it 's the house of tatas let me confirm what she said yes i went barefoot i struggled to [ unclear ] day was a huge issue and when i finished my ssc the eleventh standard i stood eleventh among one thousand students but i was about to leave the school because my poor mother couldn 't afford schooling and it was [ unclear ] tata trust which gave me six rupees per month so that is the house of tata compassion and they combine all that and it was that compassion which bothered them because when he saw in fact he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car he drives his own car by the way i must give them a car that they can afford one lakh car $ two thousand car and that 's what was said by suzuki he said oh i 'm six feet half an inch ratan is taller than me and we have ample space in the front and ample space in the back in this particular car and of course we also want to make a car in the nano segment we 'll manufacture a car in the nano segment how did this great let me tell you a bit about it for example and you are to make it within that and he told them stretch the envelope and at a point in time he got so engrossed that he himself i still am told about this story of that single wiper design in which he participated until midnight he 'd be thinking early morning he 'll be coming back with sort of solutions but who was the team leader the team leader was girish wagh in design and beyond two cylinder gas engine was used in a car with a single balancer shaft adhesives were replacing the rivets there was a co creation a huge co creation with vendors and suppliers all ideas on board were welcome imagine seeking solutions for non auto sectors it was an open innovation ideas from all over were welcome the as well as a dashboard that was inspired by and lamps were as in two wheelers and each component had to have a dual functionality serving as a mounting for the seat as well as a structural part of the functional rigidity half the number of parts are contained in nano but the current entry level cars in comparison to that is eight percent less but twenty one percent more inside what happened was that more from less you can see how much more for how much less when the model t was launched and this is by the way all the figures that are adjusted to two thousand and seven dollar prices volkswagon was eleven thousand three hundred and thirty three and british motor was around eleven thousand and nano was bang two thousand dollars is why you started actually where the same people this is a photograph of a house and a driver and a car near my own home and you can see there is a physical space that has been created for him they 've created a space in their mind that yes my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it and that 's why i it is i remember talking about this for the first time in australia about one and a half years ago when their academy honored me with a fellowship and unbelievably in forty years i was the first to be honored and the title of my talk was therefore and gandhian engineering in my judgment is the one which is going to take the world forward is going to make a difference not just for a here is an american citizen and his son and of course these feet are so designed that they can walk only on such perfect pavement or roads they not only you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions a you 're talking about you ought to look at alternatives and that is how jaipur foot was created in india it had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system a quick molding and modular components outer socket made by using heated he jumps you can see what stress it must have we 've talked about mobility and the rest of it and if you look at the drug development ten time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace after all the human and animal testing was ten years now it is fifteen years we used to have forty now they have come down to thirty so actually we are getting less from more for less and less people why less and less people so very few will be able to basically afford that psoriasis is very dreadful disease of the skin the cost of treatment twenty thousand dollars 1 000 dollar antibody injections under the skin by the way and twenty of them let 's start in the spirit of more from less and more for more looks absolutely ridiculous this has been achieved in india have been achieved in india and how they have been achieved sir francis bacon once said when you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before and therefore the standard process where you develop a molecule put it into mice into men are yielding those results the billions of dollars that have been spent however scientifically validating it and making that journey and that is how this difference has come and you can see this blending of traditional medicine modern medicine modern science i launched a big program about nine years ago he is giving us not just for psoriasis for cancer and a whole range of let me just he had said earth provides enough to satisfy every but not every man 's greed ladies and gentlemen you cannot say it 's a mere treatment it has been made possible by the certain other different reasons so you are not talking about low cost you are talking about you are talking about extreme affordability because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day you 're not talking you 're talking about disruptive innovation the ideas have to be such that you think in completely different terms and i would also add it is not only getting more from less for more by more and more people the whole world working for it i they 're not available in indian villages and infants giving that performance that had been created and by whom by young students from standford university on an extreme affordability project that they had basically and that is why the message is that of gandhian engineering i was also afraid of those eighteen minutes i 've still one and a half to go the final message is this india gave a the 21st century gift which is very very important for the whole whether it is climate change any problem that you talk about is gaining more from less for more and more so ladies and gentlemen i 'm very happy to announce this gift of the 21st century to the world from india gandhian engineering a quick question for you now when you were a young boy what is it that drove you that half a dollar that was required and one of them was [ unclear ] who taught us physics one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal convex lens the lens was here the piece of paper was there he moved it up and down and there was a bright spot up there and then he said this is the focal length but then he when the paper burned for some reason he turned to me and he said you can achieve anything what does that focal length do and the property of parallel lines is that they never meet this is convex lens leadership you know what today 's leadership is doing concave length they divide them farther so i learned the lesson of convex lens leadership from that and when i was at national chemical council of scientific industry research forty laboratories when two laboratories were not talking to each other and currently i 'm president of global research alliance sixty thousand scientists in nine counties right from india to the u s i 'm trying to build a global team which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing that was the lesson that was the inspirational moment"
