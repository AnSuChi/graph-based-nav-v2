  "transcript": "my favorite musical symbol it means to play softly if you 're playing a musical instrument and you notice a p in the this is my drawing of a p tree which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p 's there may be you 'll never reach complete silence that 's my current definition of silence a very obscure sound french sign language was brought to america during the early and as time went by mixed with local signs it evolved into the language we know today as of about two hundred years really on my mind every day as a deaf person living in a world of sound it 's as if i was living in a foreign country blindly following its rules customs behaviors and norms without ever questioning them well i watch how people behave and respond to sound you people are like my loudspeakers and amplify sound i learn and mirror that behavior and i 've seen how people respond to me for example don 't slam the door don 't make too much noise when you 're eating from the and when you 're eating make sure you don 't scrape your utensils on the plate all of these things i term sound etiquette maybe i think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person and i 'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation to be announced and you notice the staff there are no notes contained in the lines that 's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears in deaf culture movement is equivalent to sound yet for me signing it with my thumb sticking up like that doesn 't feel natural that 's why you 'll notice in my drawings i stick to four lines on paper in the year two thousand and eight i had the opportunity to travel to berlin germany for an artist residency there prior to this time i had been working as a painter during this summer i visited different museums and gallery spaces and as i went from one place to the next i noticed there was no visual art there and this struck me there was no visual art everything was auditory now sound has come into my art territory i know it so well that it doesn 't have to be something just experienced through the ears it could be felt tactually or experienced as a visual or even as an idea i started creating a new body of work and when i presented this to the art community i was blown away with the amount of support i realized sound power control social currency in the back of my mind i 've always felt that sound was your thing a hearing person 's thing and sound is so powerful i chose to be empowered and just because i don 't use my literal voice to communicate in society 's eyes so i need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice and that way i 'm able to maintain relevancy in society today so at school at work and institutions i work with many and their voice becomes my voice and identity i 'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate i delved into the world of music and i was surprised to see the similarities between music and asl for example a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper and the same holds true for a concept in meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds i 'd like to share with you a piano metaphor to have you have a better understanding of how asl works so envision a piano asl is broken down into many different grammatical parameters assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano such as facial expression body movement speed hand shape and so on as you play the piano asl is more like a chord all ten fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in asl if just one of those keys were to change the chord tone and volume by playing around with these different grammatical parameters you can express different ideas for example take the sign to look at this is the sign to look at i 'm looking at you staring at you i then started thinking what if i was to look at asl through a musical lens if i was to create a sign and repeat it over and over this is all day if i was to repeat it and slow it down visually it looks like a piece of music all and this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights i feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two this represents how time is for example 1h is one hand 2h is two hand present tense happens closest and in front of the body future is in front of the body and the past is to your back so the first example is a long time ago which is my favorite with the very romantic and dramatic notion to it once upon a time common time is a musical term yet when i see the word common time comes to mind for me is at the same time lh left hand we have the staff across the head and the chest got it that means to fall in love in international [ sign ] international [ sign as a note is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world and now this so let 's do all three together fall in love in this day and age we live in a very we need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow asl to develop its own form of currency and this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society and maybe people will understand that you don 't need to be deaf to learn asl nor do you have to be hearing to learn music and you never know might just fall in love with us"
