  "transcript": "and radioactivity billions of barrels of oil gushing in the gulf of mexico well the three big problems have in common that they are man made problems but they are controlled by natural forces this should make us feel very terribly awful as much as it should make us feel hopeful because and i was in charge of developing and i had a chance to go in the gulf of mexico and meet some fishermen and see the terrible conditions in which they were working more than seven hundred of these boats which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange were used but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected and it was going to be a very expensive technology so i wanted to develop something that we could develop very fast that would be cheap and i kept on studying how the oil spill was happening and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt if you 're using the exact same amount of surface of just paying attention to natural patterns and if you 're going up the winds you can collect a lot more material but it 's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent against the winds so the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique of sailing and tacking of the wind to capture or intercept the oil that is drifting down the wind so what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front so i built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front and was trying to pull something very long and heavy so that 's a 14 centimeter rudder i could control four meters of absorbent and so you see the the robot has a front rudder here normally it 's at the back and i could avoid an obstacle at the very last second more maneuverable than a normal boat they started so we started interacting with this what and that 's the first boat in history that completely changed the shape of the hull in order to control it when we 're turning we have the feeling of and this is exactly what we 're looking so we made a large boat with a large sail and with a very light hull inflatable very small footprint so we have a very big after this we wanted to see if we could implement this so we used the same so we had to take it back to the lab and then we put the water and then we we let it go in the water and see how well it would work so and so what we are doing is an accelerated evolution of sailing technology we went from a back rudder to a front rudder to and the more the design looks simple and cute but i wanted to show you a fish because in fact it 's very different from a fish a fish will move because by by changing like this but our boat is propelled by the wind still so so the first thing as i show you in the video is that we may be able to we always can catch the wind from both sides so if you 're looking and that 's how it takes off now but if you 're moving fast enough other property is this a normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat but because this doesn 't have either we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance we may absorb a lot of environmental noises so the the wave energy to actually but normal technology or innovation happens like this somebody has an interesting some other scientist or engineer they take it to the next level they make a theory about it and maybe they patent it and then some industry will make a contract of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it and then eventually a buyer will buy it and we hope that they are going to use [ it ] for a good purpose what we really want is that this innovation happens continuously the inventor and engineers and also the manufacturers and everybody works at the same and that 's exactly what open hardware is about it 's to replace competition by and in exchange we only ask for two things the name is credited the name of the project and i started this project alone in a garage in new orleans and in about one month we fundraised thirty thousand dollars we were most importantly we were trying our prototypes in the water as often as possible to fail as quickly as possible to learn from and she documented every step which is a website for sharing inventions less than one week after this is a team in but they eventually published a simplified design they and they got many new friends we 're working on also simpler technology not that complex with younger people and also older people like this dinosaur is from mexico so protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this global understanding of what the word business is or what it should be this is how most work and you 'll be using technology for that greenwash your audience and say increase your price tag because this is how we believe the world really works is that without the environment you have nothing we have the people so we need to protect each other yes and and profit is necessary to make this happen thank you very much if we have the courage to understand or accept that this and this is the order of priority that we need to choose what 's next for us so this small machine that you 've seen we 're hoping to make small toys like one meter remote control protei that you can upgrade so replace the remote control parts then what we want so imagine yourself you are laying down in a flexible torpedo sailing at high speed so that 's what we 're looking for developing and we replace the human being to go for example for measuring radioactivity you don 't want a human to be sailing those robots with batteries motors this is what our teammates we dream of at night we hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills or we can have swarms of our machines controlled by multi player video game engines to control many of these machines to monitor coral reefs or to monitor fisheries is that we can use open hardware technology to better understand and protect our oceans"
