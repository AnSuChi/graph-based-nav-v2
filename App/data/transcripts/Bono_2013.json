  "transcript": "anderson asked me if i could put the last twenty five years of anti poverty campaigning into ten minutes for ted that 's an englishman asking an irishman to be succinct that be a good use of your messianic complex so yeah then i thought let 's go even further the journey for justice the march against inequality and poverty really began smelling of sheep shit i guess proclaimed to the pharaoh sitting high on his throne that 's what it says here in in our holy book same country same pyramids another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book crowds are gathered in tahrir square they turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of rebooted the 21st century not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the arab spring has been neither to oversell the role of technology but these things have given a sense the pyramid gets turned upside down putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom as it were also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality because facts like people even for the poorest of the poor facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia facts that tell us what 's working and more importantly what 's facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that nelson mandela made back in two thousand and five when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity extreme poverty facts that build forget the rock opera the only thing singing today would be the facts for i have truly embraced so exit the rock star because what the facts are telling us slow journey humanity 's long slow journey of equality is actually speeding up since the year two thousand since the turn of the millennium there are eight million more aids patients getting life saving antiretroviral drugs there are eight countries in sub saharan africa that have their death rates cut by seventy five percent child mortality kids under five it 's down by two point six five million a year that 's a rate of seven let 's just stop for a second actually and think about that have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number wow great news it drives me nuts that most people don 't seem to know this news seven thousand kids a day here and they 're alive thanks in large part to dr patricia asamoah she 's amazing and the global fund which all of you financially support whether you know it or not and the global fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing hiv to their this fantastic news didn 't happen by itself it was fought for it was campaigned for it was innovated for and this great news gives birth because the historic trend is this the number of people living in extreme poverty has declined from forty three percent of the world 's population in the rate is still too high still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives there 's still work to do but it if you live on less than $ one point two five a day if you live in that kind of poverty this is not just data this is everything if you 're a parent who wants the best for your kids and i am and guess what if the trajectory continues look where the amount of people living on $ one point two five a day gets to by two thousand and thirty can 't be true can it that 's what the data is telling us if the the zero zone for sexually aroused so virtual elimination adjusted of course for inflation from a one thousand nine hundred and we do love a good baseline that 's amazing now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or latin america or model countries like brazil and who doesn 't love a brazilian model but look at sub saharan africa there 's a collection of ten countries some call them the lions who in the last decade have had a combination of one hundred percent debt cancellation a tripling of aid a tenfold increase in fdi that 's foreign direct investment which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources and they too so the pride of lions is the proof of concept there are all kinds of benefits to this for a start you won 't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up jesus like myself makes us look really young so why aren 't we jumping up and down about this well the opportunity is real but so is the jeopardy we can 't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done look at this graph and it 's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero just doing the things that we know work so inertia versus and of course the closer you get it gets harder we know the obstacles that are in our way right now in difficult times in fact today in your capital but you can do something about that you can tell politicians that these cuts [ can cost ] lives right now today in oslo as it happens oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing you can join the one campaign and leaders like mo ibrahim the telecom entrepreneur we 're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it we know that the biggest disease open data sets something the ted community is really daylight you could call it it 's getting harder to hide so let me tell you about the u report which i 'm really excited about it 's one hundred and fifty thousand millennials all across uganda young people armed with 2g phones an sms social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what in the budget and how their money is being spent look but you can delete you can erase that you really can because it 's not true anymore it 's transformational two by the time we get there every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way so i 'm here to i guess we 're here to try and infect you with this virtuous data based virus the one we call factivism it i guess we in the one campaign campaign would love you to spread it share it pass it on by doing so you will join us and countless others in what i truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken the journey of equality could we really be the great generation that mandela asked us to be might we answer that clarion call with science with reason with facts factivists have feelings too i 'm thinking of wael ghonim though some of you know him he set up one of the facebook groups behind the tahrir square he got thrown in jail for it but i have his words tattooed on my brain we are going to win we are going to win we are going to win because and we 're willing to stand up for those dreams wael is right we 're going to win if we work together as one because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power"
