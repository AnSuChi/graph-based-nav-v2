  "transcript": "of our everyday environments in america is entropy made visible i like to call it the national automobile slum you can call it suburban sprawl you can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck and it 's a tremendous problem for us the outstanding the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about we 're going to talk about that some more a sense of place your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings and to employ employ the vocabularies grammars syntaxes rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are the public realm in america has two roles it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life and it is the physical manifestation of the common good and when you degrade the public realm you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place the public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in america because we don 't have the cathedral plazas and and your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the the culture of civic design this is a body of knowledge method and principle that we threw in the garbage and it needs to by doing that it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we 're going and if there is one tremendous if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we 've built the human environments we 've made for ourselves in the last fifty years it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live hopeful present the environments we are living in more typically are like these you know this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town and remember to create a place of character and quality you have to be able to define space so how is that being over here and try to look at the target store over here you can 't see it because of the curvature of the earth that 's nature 's way of telling you that you 're doing a poor job of defining space consequently these will be places that nobody wants to be in these will be places that are not worth caring about and i want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like iraq spilling their blood in the sand and ask yourself what is their last thought of home i hope it 's not the curb cut between the chuck e cheese and the target store because that 's not good enough for americans to be spilling their blood for we need better places in this country public space this is a good public space it 's a place worth caring about it 's well defined it is emphatically an outdoor public room it has something that is terribly important it has what 's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge that 's a fancy way of saying it 's got shops and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in you know in these places in other cultures people just go there voluntarily because they like them we don 't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here kwanzaa festival people just go but this is how we do it in the united states probably the most significant public space failure in america designed by the leading architects of the day harry cobb and i m pei boston city hall plaza a public place so dismal that the winos don 't even want to go there this is the other side of the building this was the winner of an international design award in something like that it wasn 't pei and cobb another firm designed this but there 's not enough prozac in the world to make people feel ok this is the back of boston city hall the most important you know significant civic building in albany excuse me in in boston and what is the message that is coming what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming from this building and how is it informing us about who we are this fact would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of josef stalin pol pot because then we 'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us you know that it 's a despotic building it wants us to feel like termites the civic center in my town saratoga springs new york by the way when i showed this they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken and they shouted at me and said it was raining that day when you took that picture because this was perceived to be a weather problem you know this is a building designed like a dvd player audio jack power supply you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms right you know we hire firms to design these things you can see exactly what went on three o 'clock in the morning at the design meeting you know eight hours before deadline four architects trying to get this building in on time right and i mean what was the conversation that was going on there because you know what the last word was what the last sentence was of that meeting it was fuck it that that is the message of this form we don 't give a fuck he will not even go down there because you know the burglars the muggers it this pattern of building downtown blocks all over the world is fairly universal it 's not that complicated buildings so that and so on you make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor they haven 't learned that in monterey if you go out to the the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center you 'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner it 's this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building and this is what happened when in glens falls new york when we tried to do it again where it was missing right so the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story ok that completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk where the theoretical pedestrians are of course they 'll never be there as long as this is in that condition then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed we pop a handicapped ramp on that and then to make ourselves feel better we put a nature i call them nature band aids because there 's a general idea in america that the the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature and in fact the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism good buildings not just flower beds not just cartoons of the sierra nevada mountains know that 's not good enough we have to do good buildings the street trees have really four jobs to do and that 's it to spatially denote the pedestrian realm to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to those are the four jobs of the the street trees they 're not supposed to be a cartoon of the north woods they 're not supposed to be a set for the one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town between the urban and the rural they 're not the same thing and we 're not going to cure the here you see it on a small scale the mothership has landed have stepped out to test the bark mulch to see if they can inhabit this planet a lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in america was such a trauma and so what you see fairly early and that starts to be delivered in the form of the the railroad suburb the country villa along the railroad line so it really was a form of country living but what happens is of course it mutates over the next eighty years and it turns into something rather insidious it becomes a cartoon of a country house in a cartoon of the country and that 's the great of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule because it hasn 't delivered what it 's been promising for half a century now and these are basically a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state emphatically i 'm a little cabin in the woods there 's nothing on either side of me i don 't have any eyes on the side of my head i can 't see so you have this one last facade of the house the front which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house because unless the people that live here are munchkins this is really in fact a television broadcasting a show twenty four seven called we 're normal we 're normal but we know what 's going on in these houses you know we know that little skippy is loading his uzi down here getting ready for homeroom we know that heather his sister heather fourteen years old is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit and they don 't have a lot of experience with medication so they take the first one that comes along often these are not good enough for americans las vegas nevada this is you know but there 's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver so every effort is made to keep them within the the building notice that nature is present we 're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not we are entering an epochal period of change in the world and certainly in america change absolutely everything forget it it 's not going to happen we 're going to have to we 're going to have we 're going to have to live closer to where we work we 're going to have to live closer to each other we 're going have to grow more food closer to where we live the we 're going to have to we have a railroad system that the bulgarians would be ashamed of we gotta do better than that and we should have started two days before yesterday we are fortunate that the new urbanists were there for the last ten years excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage by our parents ' generation after world war ii because we 're going to need it if we 're going to learn how to reconstruct towns we 're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill in order to re learn how to compose meaningful places places that are integral that allow that are the residences make sense deployed in relation to the places of business of culture and of governance the block how to compose public space that 's both large and small the courtyard the civic square and how to really make use of of this property most of them are not going to make it they 're not going to be and if we 're lucky the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers in our existing towns and cities and by the way our towns and cities are where they are and and most of them are still going to be there although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished we 're not going to be rescued by the hyper car we 're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels no amount or combination of alternative fuels is going to allow us to continue running what we 're running the way we 're running it we 're going to have to do everything very differently so i urge you all to do what you can life in the the century is going to be about living be prepared to be good neighbors be prepared to find vocations that make you useful to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens"
