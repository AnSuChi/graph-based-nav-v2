  "transcript": "how many choices you make in a typical day i recently did a survey with over two thousand americans and the average number of choices that the typical american reports making is about seventy in a typical day and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks and they found that the average ceo engaged in about one hundred and thirty nine tasks in a week task was made up of many many many sub choices of course fifty percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less only about twelve percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category how well do you think you 're doing today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have which is the choice overload problem i now as i talk about this problem i 'm going to have some questions for you and i 'm going to want to know your answers since i 'm blind only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories so for my first question for you today are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem thank you so when i was a graduate student at stanford i used to go to this very very upscale grocery store at least at that time it was truly upscale it was a store called draeger 's they had two hundred and fifty different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over five hundred different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water but well how come you never buy anything here 's their olive oil aisle so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager and i asked is this model of offering people all this choice really working we set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store first in which case were people more likely to the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam now we see the opposite effect of the people who stopped when there were twenty four only three percent of them actually bought a jar of now if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered twenty four now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us at least it 's good for our waistlines but it turns out that this choice overload problem self interests so now for the topic of today financial savings now i going to describe to you a study i did with gur huberman emir kamenica wei jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million americans from about six hundred and fifty plans all in the u s so in these plans we had about six hundred and and what we found was that the more funds offered indeed there was less participation rate so if you look at the extremes those plans that offered you mid 70s still not as high as we want it to be now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate the more choices available now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you 're considering their future financial well being they 're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied even when they do objectively better we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises mustards vinegars jams but we can 't actually do the math of comparing so what i want to propose to you today are four simple techniques techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues cut but it 's never been more true than today that less is more people are always upset when i say cut well there 's an increase in sales there 's a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience when proctor & gamble went from twenty six different kinds of head they saw an increase in profits by eighty seven percent a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs but the ninth now in the financial savings world i think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that david laibson was heavily involved in designing which was the program that they have at harvard every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund they 're all important choices and the first thing i do is i ask neither can your consumers now before we started our session this afternoon i had a chat with gary and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world here to read it and now i 'll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you 're ready to take gary up on his offer okay anybody who 's ready to take him up on his offer is that all all right let me show you some more about this you guys knew there was a trick didn 't you now who 's ready to go on this trip now in fact you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real because the pictures made it feel more real to you which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem which is concretization that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice and that the consequences need to be felt because it doesn 't feel like real money and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more so a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro previtero we we did a study with people at ing employees that are all working at ing and during that session we kept the session exactly the way it used to be but we added one little thing the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more by doing that simple thing there was an increase in enrollment by twenty percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent categorization so for example here 's a study we did in a magazine aisle it turns out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty one different kinds of magazines all the way up to six hundred and sixty four but you know what if i show you six hundred magazines and i divide them up into ten categories versus i show you four hundred magazines and divide them up into twenty categories you believe that i have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if i gave you the four hundred than if i gave you the six hundred here are two different jewelry displays one is called jazz and if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz clap your hands okay there 's some if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing clap your hands okay now it turns out you 're right the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing but you know what this not the and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds who are they actually supposed to be informing condition for complexity it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we 've just got to take it a little easier car colors exterior car the other half of the customers are going to go from low choice car colors high choice what am i going to look at how engaged you are if you keep hitting the default button per decision that means you 're getting overwhelmed that means i 'm losing you what you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice they 're hitting that default button over and over and over again we 're losing them they 're hanging in there it 's the same information i learn how to choose even though choosing gearshift doesn 't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor it still prepares me for how to choose it also gets me excited about this big product that i 'm putting together so i 'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged so let me recap i have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload cut concretize make it real condition for complexity all of these techniques that i 'm because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing"
