  "transcript": "and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions an architect designs a building and it becomes a place or many architects design many buildings and it becomes a and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places you can experience but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world and more and more i was sitting in front of my computer and especially since about two thousand and seven and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed in this very short period of time you know whether you call it the last fifteen years or so of being online or the last you know four or five years of being online all the time and what was even more striking to me and what i really got hung up on was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own this famous image by opte this infinite expanse where we don 't seem to be anywhere on it we can never seem to grasp it in its totality it 's always reminded me of the apollo image of the earth the blue marble picture and it 's similarly meant to suggest i think that we can 't really understand it as a whole we 're always sort of small in the face of its expanse so if there was this world and this screen and if there was the physical world around me i couldn 't ever get them together in the same place and then this happened and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall there 's your problem a squirrel is chewing on your internet and this seemed astounding the internet is a transcendent idea it 's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on but that in fact seemed to be the case a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it where would it go was the internet actually a place that you could visit could i go there who would i meet you know was there something actually out there this was the internet this black box with a red light on it as represented in the because that 's where you get the best reception the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while the whole internet is it heavy they say of course not the and i was embarrassed i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit where more networks of the internet connect to each other and that connection is an unequivocally physical process it 's about the router of one network a facebook or a google or a b t or a comcast or a time warner whatever it is and that 's unequivocally physical and it 's surprisingly intimate a building like sixty hudson and a dozen or so others and sixty hudson in particular is interesting because it 's home to about a half a dozen very important networks which are the networks which serve the undersea cables that travel underneath the ocean and it 's those cables in particular that i want to focus on if the internet is a global phenomenon if we live in a global village it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean cables like this but in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive as expansive as you can imagine they stretch across the ocean they 're three or five or eight thousand miles in length the basic physical process is shockingly simple light goes in on one end of the ocean and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that 's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood and every fifty miles they amplify the signal and since the rate of transmission is incredibly fast the basic unit is a and then you 'll have maybe eight fibers in a and then they connect to the continent somewhere they connect in a manhole like this literally this is where the 5 000 mile cable plugs in three years ago when i started now there are six cables and more coming three down each coast because once a country gets plugged in by one cable they realize that it 's not enough if they 're going to build an industry around it they need to know that their connection isn 't tenuous but permanent because if a cable pick it up find the other end and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over it 's an intensely intensely physical process who until very recently worked for tata communications the communications wing of tata the big indian industrial conglomerate and which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet and they all seem to be forty two and tata had gotten its start as a communications business when they when they bought two cables one across the atlantic and one across the pacific until they had built a belt around the world which means they will send your bits to the east or the west they have this is literally a beam of light around the world and if a cable breaks in the pacific it 'll send it around the other direction and then having done that they started to look for places but what amazes me is simon 's incredible geographic imagination he thinks about the world with this incredible and i was particularly interested because i wanted to see one of these cables being built and i i wanted to see that and simon was working on a new cable wacs the west africa cable system that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa to cote d 'ivoire to ghana to nigeria to cameroon and he said there was coming soon depending on the weather but he 'd let me know when and so with about four days notice and a little after nine this guy will walk out of the water and he 'll be carrying a green nylon line a lightweight line called a messenger and that was the first link between sea and land this link that would then be leveraged into this 9 000 mile path of light and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place and then once it was in the right place he got back in the water holding a big knife and then he jumped back in and he swam back to shore and then he lit a cigarette they began to prepare to connect it to the other side for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a sort of working like chefs and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down and with this hole punch machine they fuse it together you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud it starts to and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology as much as this is an incredibly new thing the physical process itself has been around for a long time and the culture is the same you see the local laborers you see the english engineer giving directions in the background and more mombasa mumbai singapore new york when it 's done and they push the sand over that and we all forget about it"
