  "transcript": "you can 't count what you don 't see and we don 't invest in what 's invisible to but this is the face of resilience six years ago i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict and that turned out to be women news and a career i loved at the age of thirty for business school a path i knew almost nothing about but they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent so if you 're going to talk about jobs you have to talk about entrepreneurs seventy seven percent female i want to introduce i went to afghanistan in two thousand and five to work on a financial times piece and there i met kamila a young women who told me she had just turned down a job with the international community that would have paid her nearly $ two thousand a month because she was going to start her next business an entrepreneurship consultancy that would teach business skills to men and women all around afghanistan business she said was critical to her country 's future because long after this round of internationals left and she said business was even more important for women because earning an income earned respect and money was power for women i mean here was a girl who had never lived in peace time who somehow had come to sound like a candidate from the apprentice this is actually my third business my first business was a dressmaking and that 's really how i became an entrepreneur here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they couldn 't even be on their streets and at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many because everywhere i went i met more of these women who no one seemed to know about or even wish to i went on to bosnia and early on in my interviews i met with an imf official who said so maybe you could interview her so i went out reporting and within a day i met narcisa kavazovic who at that point was opening a new factory on the war 's former front lines in sarajevo she had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage sewing sheets and pillow cases she would take to markets all around the city so that she could support the twelve or thirteen family members who were counting on her for survival most of them women who were sending their boys and their girls to school wineries and even the country 's largest advertising agency and when this story posted i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official and i said just in case you here are a couple of women is hardly the only person to automatically file women under micro and so are the misleading mental images and if you see the word entrepreneur most people think men microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to but we must move beyond micro hopes and micro ambitions for women because they have so much greater hopes for themselves and in many places they 're there in the and in the developing world overall that figure is forty to fifty percent nearly everywhere i go i meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance access to markets and established business networks they are often ignored because they 're harder to help those in small businesses can 't get the capital they need to expand and those in and she had come to washington not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan she had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to africa europe the middle east and far beyond and capital that would fuel her own country 's economic climb theory and empirical evidence have already taught us we don 't need to invent solutions because we have them because women often don 't own land and that 's just to start has become very much in fashion to call women the emerging market of the emerging market because and i say this as somebody who worked in finance because investors saw the potential for return at a time of slowing economic growth and so they created financial products and financial innovation tailored to the emerging markets how wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest five hundred billion dollars unleashing women 's economic potential just think of the benefits when it comes to jobs productivity child nutrition maternal mortality literacy and much much more smaller gender gaps are directly correlated with increased economic competitiveness and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap not one so the great news is this is an incredible opportunity we have so much room to grow you see this is not about doing good this is about global growth it is about how we invest and women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group oftentimes i get into very interesting discussions with reporters who say to me gayle these are great stories but you 're really writing about the exceptions now first of all for exceptions there are a lot of them and they 're important secondly when we talk about men who are succeeding we rightly consider them icons or pioneers or innovators to be emulated and when we talk about women they are either exceptions to be dismissed and finally there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional so why wouldn 't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them this topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life my mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold tupperware at night we yours is not a three and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn 't do it and nobody i knew had done it i went to my aunt who survived years and she told me never import other people 's limitations and when i complained to my grandmother a world war ii veteran who worked in film for fifty years and who supported me from the age of thirteen that i was terrified that if i turned down a plum assignment at mcdonald 's is always hiring take the leap the women in this room and watching in we are not a special interest group we are the majority and for far too long we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others it is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world together we can make certain that the so called exceptions begin to rule when we change the way we see ourselves others will follow and it is time for all of us to think thank you very"
