  "transcript": "i want to talk about penguins today but first i want to start by saying that we need a new operating system for the oceans and for the earth now there are over thirty so the fundamental problems that we face are overconsumption and too many people except obviously it 's worse here some ways than other places because we 've only doubled the population of the earth since the little more than doubled but we have six point seven billion people in the world and when i came to live on fernandina let me just say that i had never camped before but it 's alive with life it 's hardly uninhabited so a lot has happened in the last forty years and what i learned when i came to the galapagos is the importance of wild places wild things they can swim one hundred and seventy three kilometers in a day they can swim at the same speed day and night that 's faster than any olympic swimmer i mean they can do like seven kilometers an hour and sustain it emperor penguins can go down more than five hundred meters and they can hold their breath for twenty three minutes magellanic humans without fins ninety meters three point five minutes and i doubt anybody in this room could really hold their breath for three point five minutes you have to train to be able to do that so penguins are amazing so they have all the criteria that people normally like but scientifically tell us about our world in a lot of different ways and particularly the ocean this is a picture of a galapagos penguin that 's on the front of a little zodiac here in the galapagos and that 's what i came to study i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins but you already know penguins are rare these are the rarest penguins in the world why i thought i was going to be able to do that i don 't know but the population we counted around two thousand so i don 't know how many penguins there really are but i know i can count two thousand so we have a quarter of the penguins that we did forty years and this is true of most of our living systems and i want to just show you a little bit about why most important of all i didn 't know what and you can imagine sleeping on fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome plaintful call i fell in love with penguins and it certainly has changed the rest of my life what i found out i was studying is really the difference in how the galapagos changes the most extreme you 've heard about these el ninos but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world have to adapt to this is a cold water event called la nina where it 's blue and it 's green it means the water is really cold and so you can see this current coming up and this deep undersea current the cromwell current that upwells around the it 's rich and there 's plenty of food for everyone so it 's a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas things die when there 's no food but we we didn 't even know that that affected the galapagos when i went to study penguins and you can imagine being on an island hoping you 're going to see penguins and you 're in the middle of an el nino but this is a global phenomenon we know that and if you look along the coast where i work now at a place called punta tombo the largest magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about forty four degrees south latitude and other years in these la nina years it doesn 't but that is the kind of variation that penguins have to live with and it 's not easy didn 't have any problems there were plenty of them nobody has harvested any penguins and we 're getting over one hundred thousand tourists a year to see them but the population is declining and it 's declined fairly substantially about we know this because of long term science and also in changing how we do and knowing the direction of change that we 're going in and so we have this penguin project the wildlife conservation society has funded me along with a lot of individuals over the last twenty seven years to be able to produce these kinds of we know that it 's not only galapagos penguins that are in trouble but magellanics and many other species of penguins and so we have started a global penguin society to try to focus on the real plight of penguins the nice thing is if you look down here in argentina there 's no surface oil pollution from this composite map so they were just minding their own business they ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it because when tankers carry oil they have to have ballast at some point so when they 're empty they have the ballast water in there when they come back they actually dump this oily ballast water into the ocean why do they do that because it 's cheaper because they don 't pay the real environmental costs we usually don 't and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost against the law so we ended up spending nine years convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins in some years like this year we found more than eighty percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil these little blue dots are the fledglings we do this survey every march which means that they 're only in the environment from january until march so maybe three months at the most that they could get covered in oil and you can see in some years over sixty percent of the fledglings were oiled eventually the government listened they moved the tanker lanes forty kilometers farther off shore and people are not doing as much illegal dumping seeing now is very few penguins are oiled why are there even these penguins oiled because we 've solved the problem in chubut province which is this is climate change now this has really been a fun study because i put try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins but we 've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go we thought we needed a marine protected area of about thirty kilometers and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin and these are all the little dots from where the penguins ' positions were for penguins in incubation in two thousand and three and what you see is some of these individuals are going eight hundred kilometers away from their nests so that means as their mate is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs the other one is out there foraging and the longer they have to stay gone the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back and of all of this then leads to a vicious cycle and you can 't raise a lot of chicks here you see in two thousand and three these are all the dots of where the penguins are they were raising a little over a half of a chick and you can see that they 're closer to punta tombo they 're not going as far away this past year in two thousand and nine you can see that they 're now raising about a fourth of a chick and some of these individuals are going more than nine hundred kilometers away from and then you get transferred to we need to be able to get information out to the general public and so we started a publication with the society for conservation that we think presents cutting edge science in a new novel way because we have reporters that are good writers that actually can distill the information and make it accessible to the so if you 're interested in cutting edge science and smarter conservation you should join with our eleven partners some of them here in this room like the nature conservancy and look at this magazine because we need to get information out about conservation to the general public lastly i want to say that all of you probably have had some relationship at some time in your life with a they 're amazing creatures that really change how you view the world because they 're not that different from us they 're trying to make a living they 're trying to raise their offspring they 're trying to get on and survive in the world this is turbo the penguin so we named him turbo and i just wanted to show you which he would do to a female and you can see he 's not trying to bite this guy has never been in before and he 's trying to figure out what is going on what is this guy doing this is really pretty weird and you see turbo 's pretty intent on his flipper patting and now he 's looking at the other guy saying you are really weird and now look at this so penguins really differ in their personalities just like our dogs and our cats we 're also trying to collect our information and become more technologically literate so we 're trying to put that in computers in the field and penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another this is a radio frequency id and you know who it is okay so here are a few penguins coming in see this one 's coming back to its nest they 're all coming in at this time walking across there just kind of leisurely coming in here 's a female that 's in a hurry she 's got food she 's really rushing back because it 's hot to try to feed her chicks this is my box most important thing is only you can change yourself and only you can change the world and make it better for people as well as penguins"
