  "transcript": "worst form of human rights violation like to tell you the story shaheen and anjali pranitha 's mother and towards the end of her life when she was in the final stages of aids she could not prostitute shaheen 's background i don 't even know we found her in a railway track raped by but the indications of that on her body was we still don 't know who her parents are who she is all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally anjali 's father a drunkard sold his child for pornography you 're seeing here images of three years and five year old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and across the globe hundreds and thousands of children as young as three as young as four anything everything i work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and i tell you stories from there my own journey to work with these children i don 't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part but that didn 't go into my consciousness i never felt like a victim then or now but what lingered from then till now i am forty today i and that 's what we do to all traffic survivors i started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in i had this i s officer 's daughter who is i have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very they are voiceless because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends or who want to have a family with you these are men who buy you for an hour for a day and use you throw you each of the girls that i have rescued i have rescued more than three thousand two hundred girls each of them tell me one story we think the person likes to do what she but the extra bonuses that she gets she believes yes this is it this is what my destiny is about and this is normal to get raped by and it 's abnormal to live in live in a shelter it 's abnormal to get rehabilitated it 's in that context that i work it 's in that context that i rescue children because i had lots of them and therefore my challenge was to understand how can i get out the power from this pain i was my greatest experience understanding my own pain my own because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential you see a girl here who is trained as a welder she works making furnitures she earns around twelve thousand rupees she is an illiterate girl why welding and why not one of the things that these girls had is immense amount of courage they did not have any we have trained girls as carpenters as masons and each one of them are excelling and building hopes in their own lives these girls are also working in big construction companies what has been my challenge my challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up i 've been beaten up more than fourteen times in my life i 've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue my biggest challenge it 's you and me my biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own a very supportive friend of mine a well wisher of mine used to give me every month two thousand rupees for vegetables when her mother fell sick she said so much of contacts can you get somebody in my house to work so that she can look after my mother and then she says not one of our girls it 's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking in this fantastic a c hall it 's very nice but it is not nice to bring them to our homes it 's not nice to give them employment in our factories our companies it 's not nice for our children to study with their children there it ends that 's my biggest challenge if i 'm here today i 'm here not only as sunitha they need much more than anything else your acceptance many times when i talk to people i keep telling them one thing don 't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem can you ply your mind for that one way convince to tell the story to another two persons"
