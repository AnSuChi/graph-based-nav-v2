  "transcript": "of an uncomfortable question both civilians obviously and soldiers suffer in war i don 't think any civilian has ever missed the war that they were subjected to i 've been covering wars for almost twenty years and one of the remarkable things for me how is it someone can how does that it mean the problem is that war does not have a simple neat truth one simple neat truth doesn 't want to be near it doesn 't want to know about it but if i asked all of you in this room who here has paid money to go to a cinema and be entertained by a hollywood war movie most of you would and trust me if a room full of peace loving people so do 20 year old soldiers i 've covered war for about twenty years as i said but my most intense experiences in combat were with american soldiers i 've been in africa the middle east afghanistan in the ' 90s but it was with american soldiers in two thousand and seven two thousand and eight that i was confronted with very intense combat i was in a small valley called the korengal valley in eastern afghanistan was six miles long there were one hundred and fifty men of battle company in that valley and for a while while i was there almost twenty percent of all the combat in all of afghanistan was happening in those six miles a hundred and fifty men were absorbing i spent most of my time at a small outpost called restrepo it was a few plywood b huts clinging to a side of a ridge and sandbags bunkers gun positions and there were twenty men up there i spent most of my time up there there was no running water there was no way to bathe the guys were up there for a month at a time they never even got out of their clothes they fought the worked they slept there was no phone there was no communication with the outside world up there there was no cooked food there was nothing up there that young men typically like no cars no girls no television nothing except combat combat they did learn to like and we hadn 't and we hadn 't seen any combat in a couple of weeks and everyone was and i remember the walked past me muttering oh god please someone that 's how bored they were that 's war too is a lieutenant saying please make something happen because we 're going crazy to understand that you have to for a moment think about combat not morally that 's an important job to do but for a moment don 't think about it morally think about it neurologically let 's think about what happens in your brain when you 're in combat first of all the experience is very bizarre it 's a very bizarre one it 's not what i had expected i wasn 't scared i was very scared beforehand and incredibly scared afterwards and i was woken up very abruptly this morning you notice some details very very very accurately and other things drop out it 's almost a slightly altered state of mind in your brain is you you 're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline pumped through your system it 's wired into us it the mortality rate for young men in society is six times what it is for young women from violence and from accidents jumping off of things they shouldn 't jump off of lighting things on fire they shouldn 't light on fire i mean you know what i 'm talking about they die at six times the rate you are safer as a teenage boy you would be safer in the fire department or the police department in most american cities than just walking around the streets of your hometown looking for you can imagine how that plays out in combat at restrepo every guy up there was almost killed including me including my good friend tim hetherington who was later killed in libya rounds that had cut through the fabric and didn 't touch their bodies i was leaning against some sandbags one morning not much going on sort of spacing out the bullet goes by you or hits you obviously half a second or so before the sound catches up to it so i had some sand sprayed in the side of my face imagine just think about it because i certainly did think about the angle of deviation that saved my life at four hundred meters it missed me by three inches just think about the math on that every guy up there had some experience like that at least once if not many times they got back some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home some of them stayed in the army psychologically i was particularly close to a guy named brendan o 'byrne i 'm still very good friends with him he came back to the states he got out of the army and he started talking with a woman one and she said brendan is there anything at all that you miss about being out in afghanistan about the war and he thought about it i miss almost all of it and he 's one of the most traumatized people i 've seen from that war ma 'am i miss almost all of it what is he talking about he 's not a psychopath he doesn 't miss getting shot at and seeing his friends get killed what is it that he misses we have to answer that i think what he missed is brotherhood he missed in some ways the opposite of killing what he missed was connection brotherhood has nothing to do with how you feel about the other person it 's a mutual agreement in a group that you will put the welfare of the group you will put the safety of everyone in the group above your own in effect you 're saying i love these other people more than i love myself brendan was a team leader in command of three men and the worst day in afghanistan he was almost killed so many times it didn 't bother him the worst thing that happened to him in afghanistan was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet in the helmet knocked him over kyle steiner sat back up because he 'd come back to consciousness as he was sort of half conscious he remembers people saying steiner 's been hit in the head steiner 's dead and he was thinking i 'm not dead and he sat up and brendan realized after that that he could not protect his men and that was the only time he cried in afghanistan was realizing that that 's brotherhood this wasn 't invented recently many of you have probably read the iliad achilles surely would have risked his life or given his life to save his friend patroclus in world war ii there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded crawled out of windows slipped out wounded to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there you think about all these soldiers having an experience like that a bond like that in a small group where they loved twenty other people in some ways more than they loved themselves you think about how good and they are just back in society like the rest of us are not knowing who they can count on not knowing who loves them who they can love not knowing exactly compared to that and that 's what we have to understand and in some ways fix in our society thank you very much"
