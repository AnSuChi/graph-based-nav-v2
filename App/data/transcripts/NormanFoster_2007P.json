  "transcript": "as an architect you design for for a future which is essentially the green agenda is probably and i 'd like to share some experience over the last forty years we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year and and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability what are the threats what are the possibilities the challenges the opportunities i think that many many years ago before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda that it wasn 't about fashion but what i never and what i 'm all the projects which have in some way been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life i rarely actually quote anything so i 'm going to try and find a piece of paper if i ventured the thought analyst writer a guy called thomas friedman who wrote in the herald tribune about two thousand and six he said we reached a tipping point this year where living acting designing and manufacturing green capitalistic and competitive thing they could do hence my motto green is the new red white and blue looking back when did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear and i think it was july twenty it was and before the kind of collapse of the communist system i was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in space city and other places in russia and interestingly as i think back they were the first true environmentalists they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion fired about the problems of the at that period it was in a way a number of things were happening buckminster fuller was the kind of green guru again a word that had not been coined he was a design scientist if you like a poet but he foresaw all the things that are happening now it 's another subject it 's another conversation you can go back to his writings it 's quite extraordinary it was at that time with an awareness fired by bucky 's prophecies his concerns as a citizen as a kind of citizen of the planet that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time and it 's a number of projects i select this one because it was and and you had the hippie movement and there are some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up the recommendations and all the components are there which are now in common parlance and in parallel at that time there was a very kind of exclusive design club people who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of dieter rams objects that he would create for the company called braun this is going back the and despite bucky 's prophecies that that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style access to to comfort to amenities it was very very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in and that and more besides would be in the palm of your hand and i think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point finally connects with the physical world there is the that that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness all the immediacy the orientation of the analog world probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here as we generously had gifted at lunchtime inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel a very very beautiful object so something which in and in a way evocative of the beginning of the year two thousand and seven the financial times commented that the detroit companies envy the halo effect that toyota has gained from the prius as the hybrid and i think it 's very tempting to in a way seduce ourselves as architects anybody involved with the design process that the answer to our problems lies with buildings buildings are important but they 're as i might seek to demonstrate if you could achieve the impossible the equivalent of perpetual motion you could design a for example that would be the answer unfortunately it 's not the answer it 's only the beginning of the problem you cannot separate the buildings out from the cites and the mobility of transit for example if in that phrase we then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings forty four percent in other words the transport of people which is twenty six percent cites and infrastructure work together so the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities of which the buildings are a part and you make a comparison between a recent kind of the city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center which again the city center as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial again becomes dead if you compared detroit with a city of a northern european example and munich is not a bad example of that with the greater dependence on walking and cycling then a city which is so basically if you wanted to generalize can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there that the energy consumed reduces dramatically of course you can 't separate this out from issues like social diversity mass transit the ability to be able to walk a convenient of civic spaces but again you can see detroit in yellow at the top extraordinary consumption down below copenhagen and copenhagen although it 's a dense city is not dense compared in the year two thousand a rather interesting thing happened you had for the first time mega cities five million or more which were occurring in the developing world so you have to ask yourself the environmental and you just take beijing and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the in other words as is currently happening one thousand new cars every day and that urbanization is extraordinary accelerated pace so if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the then that same process is happening in twenty years in other words it is accelerating by a factor of ten and quite interestingly and i look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology and i cite selection of projects then how how do you measure that change of technology how does it affect the design of of buildings and particularly how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy create less pollution and are more socially in a small market town and here the first thing you can see is that this building the roof is a very kind of overcoat blanket a kind of insulating garden which is also about the celebration of public space in other words for this community they have this garden in the sky so the humanistic ideal is very very strong in all this work encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery you can see sunlight and nature is part of the generator the driver for this building and symbolically the colors it has a social heart a space you have contact with nature now this was building received an award and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time and the people who 'd created it came back the project managers the company chairmen then and they were saying you know the architects norman was always going on didn 't seem to cost us any more so we humored him we kept him happy this building was wired for change so in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five the image there is of typewriters and what they were saying this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology even though those changes were not known round about that i did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive and i was saying and i wrote but we don 't have the time and we really don 't have the immediate expertise at a technical level in other words we didn 't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of bubble a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads notwithstanding the fact that the building as a green building is very much a pioneering building and if i fast forward in time what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory the library of the free university which opened last year the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality and the way in which that is enclosed by this by this skin enables the building to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy and where it 's really working with the forces of nature and what is interesting is that this is is hugely popular by the people who use it again coming back to that thing about the lifestyle the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit and you can measure the the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical if i show another aspect of that technology in a completely different context this apartment building in the alps in switzerland prefabricated from the most traditional of materials but that material because of the technology the computing ability the ability to prefabricate make high performance components out of timber very much at the cutting edge and just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology the ability to plot points in the sky and and to transmit to transfer that information now directly and here you can see the guy with his computer screen enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very very few millimeters to be slotted together on site to then be clad in the oldest technology which is the kind of hand cut shingles one quarter of a million of them applied by hand for those of us if i made the leap into these new technologies then how did we i mean you know what was life like before the mobile phone well obviously the building still happened i mean this is a glimpse and in the absence of computers you have to physically model so for example for wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air when we had and that was at the time that we reinvent the airport this is terminal four at heathrow typical of any terminal big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight lots of machinery big pipes whirring machinery the green alternative which uses natural light is a friendly place you know where you are you can relate to the outside and for a large part of its cycle not needing electric light electric light which in turn creates more heat and at that particular point in time not going back very far in time and if you looked very closely you 'd see that people were drawing and here we are now and in that reaches twenty one kilometers into the sky this is the view you would get if you looked down on that interestingly those buildings which are celebratory and very very relevant to this place our reichstag project which as a public through a process of advocacy reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians public space and maybe its hidden agenda an energy manifesto something that would be free completely the humanistic sketch the translation into the public space but this very very much a how that would work in terms of the forces of nature natural ventilation to be able to model the chamber below and to look at burning vegetable oil quite interestingly was developed in eastern germany at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc so really retranslating that technology it was virtually you can measure it again you can compare how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we took that project over seven thousand tons what it would have been with natural gas and finally with the vegetable oil four hundred and fifty we can see the same processes at work in terms of the commerce bank its dependence on natural ventilation the way that you can model those gardens the way we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption and this sequence shows the buildup of that model but what it shows first which i think is quite interesting what are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site if for example you you seek to do a building which and finally you profile this you cut grooves into it ventilation and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance which is a mesh of and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity so it also has the ability all the time regardless of the direction of the wind to be able to and what happens if we seek to use such and i 'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project it 's been well known that the dead sea is dying and the dead sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas so there has been a project which rescues the dead sea by creating a pipeline a pipe sometimes above the surface sometimes buried that will redress that and will feed from the gulf of aqaba into the dead sea using a lot of the thinking built up over the forty years what if it is the equivalent depending on where you are of the grand canal in terms of tourists habitation desalination and if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause in terms of something that that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from from communication and whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world then it 's absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible in this growing world especially in some of the places that i 'm talking about china for example now what form do they take how do you make them more friendly at that scale hong kong i refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference so what happens when we take that and you expand expand that further into the interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment two hundred and fifty excuse me fifty thousand people working twenty four hours seven days larger by seventeen percent than every terminal put together at heathrow terminal five and the challenge here is a building that will be green that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel is about friendly is coming back to that starting point is very as hubert was talking over lunch as we sort of engaged in conversation talked about this talked about cities absolutely correctly these are the new cathedrals one aspect of this conversation was triggered on new year 's eve when i was talking about in china in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations and i was voicing the thought that it just crossed my mind that new year 's eve a sort of symbolic the future was the most innovative sort of nation the way in which somebody like kennedy inspirationally could say we put a man on the moon you know who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes i thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there the chinas the indias"
