  "transcript": "will we do whatever it takes i come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making this ring that belonged to my grandfather and i wonder what his generation and perhaps the one that follows will make of the two lives this ring has worked my grandfather burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop was accepted we know now that that is not the case i fear it 's the industry in which i work that will be judged more harshly because of its impact on the climate which will be remembered for its crisis in two thousand and eight a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments away from some like promises made at the copenhagen climate summit in two thousand and nine to mobilize one hundred billion dollars a year to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels and transition to using cleaner energy and that 's a real problem because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen sooner rather than later and secondly if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today it 's going to be way more costly to change later on so for the climate history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the story need not be this gloomy though and these arguments are getting stronger let 's take a brief reminder the central banks of the us and uk began buying bonds issued by their own governments in a policy known as quantitative easing depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature this is money printing by another name us alone created four trillion dollars ' worth of its own currency this was not done in isolation in a remarkable act of cooperation the one hundred and eighty eight countries that make up the international monetary fund the imf agreed to issue two hundred and fifty billion dollars ' worth of their own currency the special drawing right to boost reserves around the world when the financial crisis moved to europe promised to do whatever it takes and they did the bank of japan repeated those words that exact same commitment to do whatever it takes to reflate their economy what this shows is that when faced with some global challenges and run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing so let 's go back to that original question can we print money for climate finance once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people and there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing uncontrolled money printing leading to hyperinflation think weimar republic in but all of this is moving the public debate forward so much so that money printing for the people but it 's important the debate doesn 't stop here with printing national currencies because climate change is a shared global problem there are some really compelling reasons why we should be printing that international currency that 's issued by the imf to fund it the special drawing right or sdr is the imf 's electronic unit of account that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other but for governments eighty eight members of the imf hold sdr quotas as part of their foreign exchange the imf issued those extra two hundred and fifty billion dollars because but here here 's the intriguing part more than half of those extra sdrs that were printed in two thousand and nine one hundred and fifty billion dollars ' worth went to developed market countries so those extra reserves that were printed in two thousand and nine so here 's an idea as a first step why don 't we start spending those unused those extra sdrs that were printed in two thousand and nine to combat climate change they could for example be used to buy bonds issued by the un 's green climate fund and it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries to meet their climate projects but if we use those extra sdrs that were issued it helps governments get back on track to meet that promise of one hundred billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis it could also it could also serve as a test case if the inflationary consequences of using sdrs in this way are benign it could be used to justify again with the commitment that countries would direct their share of the new reserves to the green climate fund printing international money in this way has several no one section of society benefits from the printing press over another that problem of competing claims is mitigated it 's also fair to say that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra sdrs it 's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control what you end up with is a collective global action aimed and it 's controlled global action aimed at a global good and as we 've learned with the money printing schemes whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules the issuance of these extra sdrs every five years such that this international currency is never more than five percent of global foreign exchange reserves that 's important because it would allay well let 's say the ridiculous concerns that the us might have and in fact i think the only thing that the sdr would likely steal from the dollar under this scheme is its nickname the greenback because the imf could have followed up its issuance its massive issuance of sdrs in two thousand and nine with a further two hundred billion dollars of sdrs in two thousand and fourteen so hypothetically that would mean that developed countries could have contributed ' worth of sdrs to the green climate fund and you know as spectacular as that sounds it 's only just beginning to look like whatever it takes and just to think what amazing things could be done with that money consider this norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to brazil if they followed through on their goals on deforestation that program has since delivered a seventy percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade that 's saving three point two billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions which is the equivalent of taking so what could we do with three hundred other climate projects like that organized on a global scale the real question is do we care enough about future generations to take the very same policy risks we took to after all we could do it we did do it and we are doing it today"
