  "transcript": "a few months ago i 'm going to tell you about a highly we may find that our universe is not the only universe but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one i mean most of us were raised to believe that the word universe means everything and i say most of us with forethought as my four year old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born and last year i was holding her and i said sophia i love you more than anything in the universe and she turned to me and said barring such an anomalous upbringing it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours most with fundamentally different features that would rightly be called universes i aim to convince you that there 's reason for taking it seriously i 'm going to describe those nobel prize winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed in part two i 'll offer a solution to that and that 's where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story okay part one it 's expanding but even so there was one thing that everyone was certain of the expansion must be slowing down that much as the gravitational pull of the earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion and they did this here 's the surprise they found that the expansion is not slowing down instead they found that it 's speeding up going faster and faster that 's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster now if you saw an apple do that you 'd want to know why what 's pushing on it similarly the astronomers ' results are surely of the nobel prize but they raised an analogous question what force is driving well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of einstein 's you see we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing but in einstein 's theory his general theory of relativity gravity can also push things apart how well according to einstein 's math if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy sort of like a uniform invisible mist then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive repulsive gravity which is just what we need to explain the observations because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space we now call it dark energy but i 've made it smokey white here so you can see it its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other driving expansion to speed up not but i promised you a mystery here in part one here it is look at what they found this number is small expressed in the maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue a technical detail of interest to experts but of no relevance to it surely is a technical detail but some details really matter some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality and this peculiar number may be doing just which takes me to part two of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory first off what is it well it 's an approach to realize einstein 's dream of a unified theory of physics a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe and the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward it says but the theory says that if you could probe smaller much smaller than we can with existing technology you 'd find something else inside these particles a little tiny vibrating filament of energy a little just like the strings on a violin they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes as they would all arise from vibrating strings it 's a compelling picture a kind of cosmic symphony but there 's a cost to this elegant unification because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn 't quite work it has internal inconsistencies unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar extra dimensions width but even though the dimensions are hidden they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape so particle masses the strengths of forces and most importantly the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions so if we knew the shape of the challenge is we don 't know all we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math now when these ideas were first developed there were only about five different candidate shapes so you can imagine analyzing them from five the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands a large but still manageable collection to analyze since after all graduate students need something to do but then the list continued to the billions until today the list of candidate shapes has soared to about ten to the five hundred so what to do well but others turned this issue on its head maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other each is as real as every other in the sense that there are many universes each with a different shape for the extra dimensions and this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery the amount of dark energy revealed by the nobel because you see if there are other universes and if those universes each have say a different shape for the extra dimensions then the physical features of each universe will be different and in particular the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different which means that the mystery of in this context the laws of physics can 't explain one number for the dark energy because there isn 't just one number there are many numbers which means we have been asking the wrong question it why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we 've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and in those universes that have much less dark energy well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that again galaxies don 't form and without galaxies there are no stars no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes so we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we 've measured simply because our universe has would be that mystery solved multiverse found now some find this explanation if the feature you 're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number why the sun is million miles away from the earth and he worked for decades trying to explain this number but he never succeeded and we know why kepler was asking the wrong question we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars so hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number ninety three million miles well that is simply wrongheaded why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance instead of any of the other possibilities and again that 's a question we can answer those planets which are much closer to a star like the sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn 't exist and those planets that are much farther away so we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life it may also be the right kind of reasoning one key difference of course is we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes and that takes me to my final part part three because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang but there 's a little secret it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang but gives us no insight into what would have and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory it 's called inflationary cosmology which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space the fuel is based on something called a quantum field but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it 's virtually impossible but it would also generate countless other big bangs each each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes and the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes the different shapes yield different physical features and we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it 's only in our universe that the physical features like the amount of dark energy and this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider could we ever confirm the existence of other universes well let me describe one way that might one day happen the inflationary theory already has strong observational support because the theory predicts that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world yielding a distinctive fingerprint a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots across space which powerful telescopes have now observed going further and if our universe got hit by another that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect and so exotic as this picture is it may one day be grounded in observations establishing the existence of other universes i 'll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future you see we learned that our universe is not static that space is expanding that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes but because the expansion is speeding up in the very far future those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won 't be able to see them not because of technological limitations the speed of light will not be able to overcome the ever widening gulf between us so astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch and they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era like ours attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies but would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge or would they believe in the black static empty universe that their own i suspect the latter which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration it appears that it may not always be that way because today 's astronomers by turning powerful telescopes to the sky have captured a handful of starkly informative photons a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit and the message echoing across the ages is clear sometimes the true nature of reality beckons thank you very much chris anderson brian thank you the range of ideas you 've just spoken about are dizzying how do you think of where cosmology is now in a sort of historical side are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion bg well it 's hard we now can understand how old the universe is we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down thirteen point seven two billion years ago and yet we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future ca you 're maybe some of these conversations can continue thank you"
