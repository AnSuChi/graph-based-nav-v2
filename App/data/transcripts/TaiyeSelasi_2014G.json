  "transcript": "in thirteen months i flew to fourteen countries and gave some hundred talks every talk in every country comes from england and the states whenever i heard this opening sentence no matter the country that concluded it england america ghana nigeria i thought but that 's not my father was born in gold coast a british colony raised in ghana and has lived for over thirty years in the kingdom of saudi arabia for this reason my also called me i went to louisiana a museum in denmark where i shared the stage with the writer colum mccann i 'm not i 'm not a national how can a human being come from a concept it 's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades from newspapers textbooks conversations i had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal singular naturally occurring things but i wondered to say that i came from appeared timor leste failed somalia my parents came from countries that didn 't exist when they were born to me a country this thing that could be contract hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being and so it came as a huge relief to discover what we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood an idea that came into fashion only four hundred when i learned this beginning my masters degree in international relations cultures were real but countries were invented in two thousand and five i wrote an essay is an afropolitan sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country it and instructional how many others didn 't buy my sense of self how can selasi claim to come from her parents are layla who speaks fluent twi knows accra like the back of her i thought she 's not from ghana despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban accra i like my critics was imagining some ghana where all ghanaians had brown skin or none held u k passports fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets the privileging of a fiction the singular country over reality the penny finally dropped with new york city where i started work with lawrenceville my relationship is with dzorwulu where my father and i talk for hours instead of where are you from where are you a local this would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are tell me you 're from france and i see what a set of tell me you 're a local of fez and paris better yet goutte d 'or three step test in what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face as a child i carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in boston with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from london and lagos we took off our shoes in the house we were unfailingly polite with our elders we ate slow cooked spicy food the first time i went to delhi or to southern parts of italy i was shocked by how at home i felt the rituals were familiar number one rituals to whom do you speak at least once a week be it face to face or on facetime be reasonable in your assessment i 'm not talking about your facebook friends i 'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional my best friends in new york these relationships are home for me r number two relationships we but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions by restrictions i mean where are you able to live what passport do you hold are you restricted by say racism from fully at home where you live but the question takes us past where are you now take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can i have a friend named olu he 's thirty five years old his he loves going to nigeria the weather the food the friends i have another friend named udo he 's also after the war where is udo from with his blonde hair and blue eyes udo could pass for german that udo is from argentina has largely to do with history that he 's a local of buenos aires and berlin that has to do with life olu who looks nigerian needs a visa to visit nigeria he speaks yoruba with an english accent and english with a german one to claim that he 's not really nigerian though denies his experience in lagos the rituals he practiced growing up his relationship with family and friends though lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes olu always feels restricted there both he and udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents ' countries from living where some of their most meaningful to say olu is from nigeria and udo is from argentina distracts from their common experience their rituals their relationships and their restrictions are the same of course when we ask where are you from we 're using a kind of shorthand it 's quicker to say nigeria than but that 's not quite the point the difference between where are you from replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs even that most glorious expression of countryhood the world cup gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players that 's why olu says i 'm german but my parents come from nigeria in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another layers that merge together that can 't be denied or removed that i carry within me where i 'm from comes wherever i go to be clear i 'm not suggesting that we do away with countries there 's much to be said for national history more for the sovereign state what i 'm questioning is primacy all of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation as if knowing what country i came from would tell my audience who i was what are we really seeking though when we ask where someone comes from and what are we really seeing when we hear an answer basically countries represent power where are you from it 's possible that without realizing it we 're playing a power game especially in the context of multi ethnic countries as any recent immigrant knows the question where are you from or where are you really from is often code for why are you then we have the scholar william deresiewicz 's writing of elite american colleges students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from missouri and another from pakistan never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers i the same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum a mexican gardener in los angeles and a nepali housekeeper in delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality my father can 't go back either the country in which he was born that country no longer exists we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it something somewhere will always have changed most of all ourselves people talking about is human experience this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair the more human the characters start the more relatable not less the myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from all of us are multi multi to begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together i think not further apart so i 'd love to hear the truth a human being like everybody here she isn 't a citizen of the world but a citizen of worlds she is a local of new york rome and accra"
