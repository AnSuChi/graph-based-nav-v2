  "transcript": "a public dewey long ago observed is constituted through discussion and debate if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question the realm of the unquestioned then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion it is in this spirit that i join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time namely how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building to put the assumptions very clearly capitalism after one hundred and fifty years has become acceptable and so has democracy if we looked in the world of one thousand nine hundred and forty five and looked at the map the question now however is both about which form of capitalism but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions and that provides the ground for a type of action because consensus of each moment no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems most of the globe experiences the state as repressive as an organization that is concerned about rather than provision of it and in terms of experience of capitalism there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences first extractive industry smuggled emeralds that is cut right from under the poorest second is technical assistance and technical assistance might shock you but it 's the worst form of today of the ugly face who are incapable next assumption i express my deep sympathy and before that september eleven have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds we live in one world and then inclusion for some we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world otherwise we will be missing where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics what is one of these organizations to pick we have three critical terms economy civil society and the state i will not deal with those first two except to say economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context my and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling for which i have enormous my colleagues at johns hopkins were among the best why don 't we simplify and say what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform clare lockhart and i are writing a book on this we hope to share that much widely with and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively and provision of infrastructure management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation i hope the questions will give me an opportunity basically because contrary to widespread assumption i would argue that we know how to do this who would have imagined if you looked at it from the perspective of oxford of one thousand nine hundred and forty three and there are lots of other examples now in order to do this and this brings this group we have to rethink the notion of capital money is not capital in most of the developing countries it 's just cash because it lacks the institutional organizational managerial forms to turn it into capital and what is required is combination of physical capital institutional capital human capital and security of course is critical but so is information now the issue that should concern us here and that 's the challenge that i would like to to pose to this group is again it takes sixteen years in your countries to produce it takes twenty years to produce somebody with a ph d the first challenge is to rethink fundamentally the issue of the time do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited our educational systems are inherited from the absolute majority of the world 's population are below twenty and they are growing larger and faster they need different ways of being approached different ways of being enfranchised but you 're not engaging your global responsibility you only want clean environments in which to function if you don 't think through the problems of corruption who will but your designs are selfish it 's for your own immediate use the world in which i operate operates with designs or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in sixty years this is not right it requires thinking but particularly what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work as the work on paradigms long time ago showed thomas kuhn 's work and i hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor through this means thank you you were the finance minister of afghanistan a country right at the middle of much of the world 's agenda is the country gonna make it will democracy flourish what scares you most ashraf ghani what scares me most is is you lack of your engagement you asked me you know i always give the unconventional answer 20 year perspective today the world of globalization is on speed but in my world you know when i went back to afghanistan after i rode traveled travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took twelve so the first is when the scale is that we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure it takes six years any meaningful sort of thing but the modality of attention second is when a country has been subjected brutal forms of exercise of power we had the red army for ten continuous years one hundred and ten every afghan sees the sky as a source of fear we were bombed tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism the united states great britain joined egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror how to turn a donkey a carthorse anything so when violence erupts in a country like afghanistan it 's because of that legacy have to understand that we 've been incredibly lucky i mean i really can 't believe how lucky i am here standing i thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent ninety one percent of the men in afghanistan eighty six percent of the women listen to at least three radio stations a day i think that i would dare say they 're much more sophisticated than rural americans with college degrees and the bulk of europeans because the world matters to them and what is their predominant concern abandonment become deeply internationalist and i told them my people with the americans here yes i have an advisory position with the u n they engage they see engagement to the future of the ordinary people where her children could really have a different life that gives me hope to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade ag certainly well the first is instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies they should give this hundred billion dollars to fifty of the most critically innovative companies in the world the key to the drug eradication is jobs look there 's a very little known fact countries that have a legal average income per capita of one thousand dollars don 't produce drugs textile trade is the key not aid and europe should give us a zero percent tariff if you want us to be able to compete with china and to attract investment we could probably attract four to six billion dollars the textile sector if there was zero tariffs cotton does not compete with with opium a they don 't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again what we want is a partnership with the italian design firms why can 't we do what was done with northern italy with the put out system so i think economically the critical issue really is to now think through and what i will say here is that aid doesn they didn 't want to give us"
