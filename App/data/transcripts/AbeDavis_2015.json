  "transcript": "most of us think of motion as a very visual thing if i walk across this stage or gesture with my hands while i speak that motion is something that you can see and over the past few years we 've started to find that cameras can often see this motion even when humans can 't so let me show you what i mean and on the right you see video of a sleeping infant but if i didn 't tell you that these were videos you might assume that you were looking at two regular images because in both cases these videos appear to be almost completely still and if you were to hold the infant on the right you would feel the rise and fall of her chest as she took each breath and these motions carry a lot of which is software that finds these subtle motions in video and amplifies them so that they become large enough for us to see and we can use this as a and so this technology is really powerful because it takes these phenomena that we normally have to experience through touch and it lets us capture them visually and non invasively we thought it 's cool but what if we could do the same thing with our ability to hear which are just another kind of motion and turn everything that we see into a microphone now so let me try to put it in perspective for and that diaphragm is designed to move readily with sound but sound causes all objects to those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see so what if we record them with a high speed camera and then use software to extract tiny motions from our high speed video and analyze those motions to figure out what sounds created them this would let us turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance and so we tried this out and here 's one of our experiments where we took this potted plant that you see on the right and we filmed it with a high speed camera while a nearby loudspeaker played this sound because our sound only moved those leaves by about a micrometer that 's one which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible because with the right algorithms we can take this silent how is this possible how can we get so much information out of so little motion well let 's say and let 's say that that shifts our image by just a thousandth of a pixel then suddenly a thousandth of a pixel pixel can start to add up to something pretty significant on a personal note we were pretty psyched when we figured this out laughter but we were still missing a pretty important piece of the puzzle there 's the object and how far away it there 's the camera and the lens that you use how much light is shining on the object and how loud your sound is because if we got any of these factors wrong there was no way to tell what the problem was we would just get noise back and so a lot of our early experiments looked like this so this is how it went down so this experiment looks completely ridiculous i mean i 'm screaming at a bag of chips and we 're blasting it with so much light we literally melted the first bag we tried this because it was the first time we recovered intelligible human speech from silent video of an object and so it gave us this point of reference and gradually we could start to modify the experiment using less light or quieter sounds because once we understood those limits we could figure out how to push them and that led to experiments like this one and the whole thing is lit by only natural sunlight and so here 's the video that we captured and this is what and here 's what we were able to recover from our silent video captured outside behind that window so here 's a quieter experiment and in this case our goal was to recover the music that was playing on that laptop from just silent video of these two little plastic earphones and we were able to do this so well that i could even shazam our results we can also push things by changing the hardware that we use but we 've also found a way to use this technique with more regular cameras and we do that by taking advantage of what 's called a rolling shutter and so if an object moves during and this causes and so what we found is that by analyzing these artifacts we can actually recover sound but this time we used just a regular store bought camera and so in a second i 'll play for you the sound that we recovered and it 's going to sound distorted this that sounds distorted what 's really amazing here and but keep in mind that there 's already a lot of very mature technology out there for surveillance in fact but what 's really new here what 's really different is that now we have a way to picture the vibrations of an object but also about the object but there 's another important way that we learn about the world that 's by interacting with it we push and pull and poke and prod things we and that 's something that video still won 't let us do and the basic idea is that we 're going to use the vibrations in a video to capture objects in a way that will let us interact with them and see how they react to us so to make that happen we 're just going to bang a little bit on the surface surface where it 's resting while we record this video and we 're going to use the vibrations in that video to learn about the structural and material properties of our object and we 're going to use that information and so here 's what we 've created because now i can take my mouse and i can start interacting with the object and so what you see here and we created it from just five seconds of regular video and you could imagine for instance looking at an old bridge and wondering what would happen how would that bridge hold up if i were drive my car across it and that 's a question that you probably want to answer before you start driving across that bridge but and i didn 't do anything to this bush but by capturing a minute long video a gentle breeze caused enough vibrations that we could learn enough about this bush to create this simulation and so you could imagine giving this say the strength and direction of wind in a shot after it 's been recorded natural air currents in this room created enough subtle and ironically we 're kind of used to having this kind of interactivity when it comes to virtual objects but to be able to capture this information from real objects in the real world using just simple so here are the amazing people who worked with me on these projects applause and what i 've shown you and so looking to the future it 's going to be really exciting to explore what this can tell us about the world"
