  "transcript": "it was like breathing in those days for several days now we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at ted i used to be able to talk like that so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me i will start with my wife chaz going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in two thousand and six i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show ' ebert and roeper at the movies the doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw larynx and vocal cords were still i was optimistic and all was right with the world the first surgery was a great success i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good i was ready to return home suddenly i had an episode of catastrophic bleeding my carotid artery had ruptured thank god i was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there and would have died right there and then so thank you leonard cohen for saving my life there was a second surgery which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart until it failed and before i left the hospital after a year of i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery it just sort of became obvious human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system we need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment which chaz called sir lawrence it was the clearest i could find then apple released the alex voice which was the best i 'd heard there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices and i 've experimented with them for me they share a fundamental problem they 're too i need to type fast and to jump right how does that affect who you are as a person how did i feel not being able to speak and i still feel a lot of distance from the human mainstream i 've become uncomfortable when i 'm separated from my laptop even then i 'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of thirty years at first i was against it i thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer so we contacted a company in scotland that created personalized computer voices they but they were willing to give it a the tapes from my tv show weren 't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved movie soundtracks for example or gene siskel arguing with me and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn 't fit into a sentence and here 's the voice we call roger jr or roger two point zero roger two point zero i can 't tell you how great it is to be back on your show we have been talking for a long time and now here we are again this is the but at least it sounds like me when i type anything this voice will speak whatever i type when i read something it will read in my voice i have typed these words in advance as i didn 't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on casablanca and citizen kane this is the first voice they 've created for an individual there are several very good voices available for while this voice sounds like me i plan to use it on television radio and the internet people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built in speaking systems but i 've got to say in first grade said i talked too much and now i still can roger ebert and i 'm optimistic about it i wrote a blog about it and actually got a comment from the actor who played alex he said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice a very large sample is needed john hunter all my life i was a motormouth now i have spoken my last words and i don 't even remember for sure what they were i feel like the hero of that harlan ellison story titled i have no david christian explained to us what a tiny instant there was no life on earth at all for almost all the years of life on earth there was no intelligent life only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next finally came mankind 's most advanced and mysterious tool the computer that has mostly happened in my lifetime the birthplace of hal nine thousand it was about one thousand nine hundred and sixty as a local newspaper reporter still in high school i was sent over to the computer lab of the university of illinois to interview the creators of something called plato the initials stood for they even dreamed of what salman khan has but that 's not the point the point is plato was only fifty years ago an instant in time online but i 'm not here from the chamber of i started writing on a computer back in the when one of the first atech systems was installed at the chicago i was in line at radio shack to buy one of the first model one hundred 's and when i told the people in the press room at the academy awards they didn 't know what i was talking about does anybody remember that the sun times sent me to the cannes film festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase i joined compuserve when it had fewer numbers than i currently have followers on twitter i am lucky to live in history at all because without intelligence and memory there is no history for billions of years the universe evolved completely without notice now we live in the age of the internet which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness i can communicate as well as i ever could we are born into a box of time and space we use words and communication to break out of it and to reach out to others for me the internet began as a useful tool i can only type so fast computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated i can communicate more widely than ever before twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation but they 're the best i they give me a way to speak not everybody has the patience of my wife chaz this whole adventure has been a learning experience i was left with a little less flesh and bone now i have no jaw left at all and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk but no you don 't it is human nature to look at someone like me and assume i have lost some of my marbles people there are people who don 't want to make eye contact believe me he didn 't mean this as anyway let me just read it you should never let your wife read something like this it is human nature to look don 't enjoy a reminder of our own fragile mortality that 's why writing on the internet has become a lifesaver for me i have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way one of my twitter friends can type only with his toes one of the funniest blogs on the web is written by a friend of mine named smartass cripple google him and he will make you laugh all of these people are saying in one way or another that what you see is not all you get for the time being i am writing as well as ever i am productive i would be trapped inside my head because of the rush of human knowledge because of and i do not need to scream re i have one more thing to add the psychiatrist says you 're crazy the guy says i want a second opinion the psychiatrist says all right you 're ugly you all know the test for artificial intelligence if a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as henny youngman then that 's the voice i want"
