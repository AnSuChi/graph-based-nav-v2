  "transcript": "now lesterland looks a lot like the united states like the united states it has about three hundred and eleven million people and of that three hundred and eleven million people it turns out if matt 's in the audience i just borrowed that i 'll return it in a second this character from your from your series so one hundred and forty four thousand are called lester which means about percent is named lester now lesters in lesterland have this extraordinary power there are two elections every election cycle in lesterland one is called the you must do extremely well what can we say about democracy in lesterland obviously this dependence upon the lesters is going to produce a subtle no doubt but it 's dependent upon the lesters and dependent upon the people it has competing dependencies we could say conflicting dependencies depending upon who the now there are three things i want you to see now that i 've described lesterland number one the united states is lesterland the in the general election it 's the citizens who get to vote if you 're over eighteen in some states if you have an id in the money election it 's the funders who get to vote the who get to vote and just like in lesterland the trick is to run in the general election you must do extremely well in the money election you don 't necessarily have to win there is jerry brown but you must do there are just as few relevant funders in as there are the numbers from two thousand and ten 26 percent of america gave two hundred dollars or more to any federal candidate 05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate 01 percent the one percent of the one percent gave ten thousand dollars or more to federal so i 'm just a lawyer i look at this range of numbers and i say it 's fair for me to say it 's in this sense the funders are our lesters now what can we say about this democracy in usa land well as the supreme court said in citizens united we could say of course the people have the ultimate influence but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election this dependence upon the funders candidates for congress and members of congress and the question we need to ask is what does it do to them these humans as they spend their time behind the telephone a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money they become in the words of the as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money not on issues one to ten eleven to one thousand leslie byrne a democrat from virginia describes that when she went to congress she was told by a colleague always lean to the green then to clarify she went on he was not an environmentalist so here too we have a democracy a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people competing dependencies possibly conflicting point number one here 's point number two the worse than lesterland because you can imagine in lesterland if we lesters got a letter from the government that said hey you get to pick who gets to run in the we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of lesters you know there are lesters from every part of social society there are rich lesters poor lesters black lesters white lesters in this land because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the 05 percent are not comprising it for the public interest it 's for their private interest in this sense the usa is worse than lesterland and finally point number three whatever one wants to say about lesterland against the background of its history its traditions in our land in lesterland is a corruption a corruption it 's a corruption relative to the framers ' baseline for this republic the framers gave and by a representative democracy they meant a government as madison put it in federalist fifty two that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone so here 's the model of government they have the people and the government but the problem here now but it 's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people this is it blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about it blocks the right too as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly so the right wants smaller government when al gore was vice president his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry the chief policy man took how are we going to raise money from them pathological because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election that means the tiniest number of us i know that should have been like a rock or something i can only find cheese i 'm sorry so there there is an economy here an economy of influence an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization the better that it is for this fundraising henry david thoreau there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root this is the every single one of you knows this you couldn 't be here if you didn 't know this yet you ignore it you ignore it like eradicating polio from the world or taking an image of every single street across the globe or building the first real universal translator or building a fusion factory in your garage these are the manageable problems so you ignore but we cannot ignore this a government that works and not works for the left or the right but works for the left and the right the citizens of the left and right because there is no sensible reform so i want you to take hold to grab the issue you care the most about climate change is mine but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax there will never be a christmas we will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first so it 's not that mine is the most important issue it 's not but mine is the first issue the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about no sensible reform and we cannot afford so how do we do it turns out the analytics here are easy simple the solution is to have them spend less a statute of the american act an idea in my book that i call the grant and franklin project to give vouchers to people to fund elections an idea of john sarbanes called the grassroots democracy act each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence because this reform would a democrat from tennessee put it has become a farm league for k street and as united republic calculated last april the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was one thousand four hundred and so it 's fair to ask how is it possible for them to change this now i get this cynicism i get this sense of impossibility but i don 't buy it this is a solvable issue if you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the 20th century those are hard issues you don 't wake up one day no longer a racist it takes generations to tear that intuition that dna out of the soul of a people but this is a problem of just incentives just incentives change the incentives and the behavior changes and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice when connecticut adopted this system in the very first year seventy eight percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took it 's solvable not by being a democrat not by being a republican it 's solvable by being citizens by being citizens by being look i could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy i could give you back a republic what the five years since i spoke at ted has taught me as i 've spoken about this issue again and again is even if you think it 's impossible that is irrelevant i spoke at dartmouth once and a woman stood up after i spoke i write in my book and she said to me convinced me this is hopeless hopeless there 's nothing we can do when she said that i scrambled i tried to think how do i respond to that hopelessness what is that sense of hopelessness and what hit me was an image of my six year old son and i imagined a doctor coming to me and and there 's nothing you can do nothing you can do so would i do nothing would i just sit there accept it okay nothing i can do i 'm going off to build google glass of course not i would do everything i could and i would do everything i could because this is what love means that the odds are irrelevant and that you do the hell you can the odds be damned and then i saw the obvious link because even we liberals love this country what this love of country says back is everyone in this room loves and cherishes if we lose this republic and so we act so here 's my question do you have that love do you when ben franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in september of one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven he was stopped in the street by a woman who said mr franklin what have you wrought franklin said a republic madam if you can keep it we have lost that republic all of us have to act to get it back"
