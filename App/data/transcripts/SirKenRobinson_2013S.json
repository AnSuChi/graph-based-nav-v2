  "transcript": "i moved to america twelve years ago with my wife terry and our two kids actually truthfully we moved to los angeles it 's a short plane ride from los angeles to america i got here twelve years ago and when i got here i was told various things like americans don 't get irony have you come across this idea it 's not true i 've traveled the whole it 's one of those cultural myths like the british are reserved we 've invaded every country we 've encountered laughter but it 's not true americans don 't get irony but i i just want you to know that that 's what people are saying thankfully nobody was ironic in your presence but i knew that americans get irony when i came across that legislation no child left behind because whoever thought of that title gets now i can see that 's not a very attractive name for legislation millions of children left behind i can see that and here 's how it 's in some parts of the country sixty percent of kids drop out of high school in the native american communities it 's eighty percent of kids if we halved that number one estimate is it would create a net gain to the u s economy over ten years of nearly a trillion dollars it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg what it doesn 't count are all the kids who are in school who don 't enjoy it who don 't get any real benefit from it the first is this that human beings are naturally different and diverse can i ask you how many of you have got children of your own and the rest of you have seen such children small people wandering about i will make you a bet and i am confident that i will win the bet if you 've got two children or more i bet you they are completely different from each other system so we don 't get confused education under no child left behind is based on not diversity but conformity what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement one of the effects of no child left behind has been they 're necessary but they 're not sufficient the humanities to physical education an awful lot of kids in america currently is that something like ten percent of kids getting on that way are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder if you sit kids down hour after hour don 't be surprised if they start to fidget you know children are not for the most part suffering from a psychological condition they 're suffering from childhood and i know this because i spent my early life as a child i went through the whole thing kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents not just a small range of them and by the way the second principle that drives human life flourishing they will learn without any further assistance very often it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out or to stifle it of achievement now the reason i say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here if i can say so has been to there is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools but teaching is a creative profession teaching properly conceived is not a delivery system you know you 're not there just to pass on received information great teachers do that stimulate provoke engage you see in the end education is about learning if there 's no learning going on there 's no education going on and people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning the whole point of education is to get people to learn an old friend of mine actually very old he 's dead that 's as old as it gets i 'm afraid but a wonderful guy wonderful philosopher he used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs you can be engaged in the activity of something but not really be achieving it like dieting it there he is he 's dieting is he losing any weight not really teaching is a word like that she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it the role of a teacher is to facilitate learning that 's it but testing now testing is important standardized tests have a place but they should not be the dominant culture of education they should be diagnostic they should help i want some standardized tests i do i want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else 's but all that should support learning it shouldn 't obstruct it which of course it often does so in place of curiosity what we have is a culture of compliance our children and teachers are encouraged to follow it 's why we all have different rsums we create our lives and we can recreate them as we go through them it 's the common currency of being a human being other animals may as ours i mean you may have a dog and your dog may get depressed you know but it doesn 't listen to radiohead does it and sit staring out the window with a bottle of jack daniels we all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities and one one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of it really doesn 't finland the thing about they have a very broad approach to the arts second but it 's not what gets people up in the morning what keeps them at their desks the third thing and i was at a meeting recently with some people from finland actual finnish and somebody from the american system was saying to the people in finland what do you do about the drop out rate in finland and they all looked a bit bemused and said well we don 't have one we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them now people always say it to a state in america many states in america have fewer people in them than that i 've been to some states in america and i was the only person there really really i was asked to lock up when i left but what all the high performing systems in the world do sadly across the systems in america they recognize that it 's students who are learning and the system has to engage them their curiosity their the second is that they they recognize that you can 't improve education if you don 't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development investing in professional development is not a cost it 's an investment and every other country that 's succeeding well knows that whether it 's australia and the third is they devolve responsibility you see there 's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education that 's what happens in some systems or state governments decide they know best and they 're going to tell you what to do the trouble is that and if you remove their discretion it stops working you have to there is wonderful work happening in this country and that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education it 's like education is an industrial process that can and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough if we just get it right it will all hum along perfectly into the future it won 't and it never did the point is that education is not a mechanical system it it 's about people people who either do want to learn or don 't want to learn every student who drops out of school has a reason for it they may find it irrelevant but the stories are always close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside and all the evidence from around the world is if we all did that there 'd be no need for the alternative so i think we have to embrace a different metaphor and there are and the culture of the school is absolutely essential culture is an organic term isn 't it not far from where i live is a place called death valley driest place in america and nothing grows there nothing grows there because it doesn 't rain hence death valley in the winter of two thousand and four it rained seven inches of rain fell over a very short period and in the spring of two thousand and five there was a phenomenon the whole floor of death valley was carpeted in flowers it 's dormant right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about if the conditions are right life you take an area a school a district you change the conditions give people a different sense of possibility a different set of expectations a broader range you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do real role of leadership in education and i think it 's true at the national level the state level at the school level and if you do that people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn 't have expected wonderful quote from benjamin franklin there are three sorts of people in the world those who are immovable there are people who are movable people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it and there are people who move people who make things happen and and if the movement is strong enough that 's in the best sense of the word a revolution and that 's what we need thank you very much"
