  "transcript": "but it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space it can contemplate the meaning of infinity and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world it 's the greatest mystery confronting human beings how does this all come about well the brain as you know is made up of neurons we 're looking at neurons here there are one hundred billion neurons in the adult human brain and based on this one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain and study changes in their behavior this is what i spoke about in the last ted today i 'll talk about and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain now one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in italy in parma by giacomo rizzolatti and his colleagues now it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in which have been known for over fifty years these are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time maybe about twenty percent of them will also fire when i 'm looking at somebody else performing the same action so and this is truly astonishing because it 's as though this neuron is adopting the other person 's point of view because to imitate a complex act now let 's look at culture the phenomenon of human culture if you and that is there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use the use of fire the use of shelters and of course language and the ability to read somebody else 's mind and interpret that person 's behavior all of that happened relatively quickly even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago hundred thousand years ago all of this happened very very quickly and i claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people 's actions so that when there was a sudden or a particular type of tool instead of dying out this spread down the generations so this made evolution suddenly lamarckian instead of darwinian maybe one hundred thousand years a human being a child can just watch its parent kill and learn it in one step what the polar bear took one hundred thousand years to learn maybe ten minutes this is the basis the imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization now there is another kind of mirror neuron which is involved in something quite different and that is there are mirror just as there are mirror neurons for action there are mirror neurons for touch in other words if somebody touches me my hand neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires but the same neuron in some cases will fire when i simply watch another person being touched but a subset of them will fire even when i watch somebody else being touched in the why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation by all means with the other person so the arm is numb and there is no sensations coming in if i now watch you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings so i call them or empathy neurons you experience that person 's touch in your mind you 've dissolved the barrier between you and other and that is there is no real independent self aloof from other human inspecting the world inspecting other people you are in fact connected not just via facebook and internet you 're actually quite literally connected by your neurons and there is whole chains of neurons and this is not mumbo jumbo philosophy it emerges from our understanding of basic almost as though the neuron were were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged from other human beings"
