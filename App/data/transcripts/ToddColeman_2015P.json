  "transcript": "she doesn 't look the happiest that 's in part because it requires technicians and experts to apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions another reason jane is not so happy is because she 's worried in particular she 's worried about what happens after her 10 day stay on bed rest at the hospital as an woman she 's twice as likely to have a premature birth stay at the hospital on bed rest a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill or head home after her 10 day stay and hope for the best as i began to think about stories like this and hear about stories like this i began to ask myself and imagine is there an alternative is there a way we could have the benefits of i encouraged people in my research group to partner with some and after a long process we came up with a vision an idea of a wearable system that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry or you could apply to yourself like a band aid and after many trials and except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body they can measure the types of information that we want things such as electrical rhythms of the body and so forth and can have wireless transmission capabilities but in addition we began to including like jane here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional in addition our flexible electronic patches are there where the red corresponds to what was acquired with the conventional belts and the blue corresponds to our estimates using our flexible electronic systems and our algorithms some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context but there was still a problem the problem was the way we manufactured these systems as we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital they encouraged us to make sure that our electronics we had an epiphany and that could solve our manufacturing problem this picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of scotch tape ongoing work in our research group allows us to in addition integrated circuits into the flexible adhesives to do things like amplifying signals and digitizing them processing them and encoding for wireless transmission all of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital we had some other challenges from both an engineering as well as a usability perspective to make sure that we could make it used practically in many digital health discussions people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data and in the cloud we can extract meaningful information for interpretation and indeed you can do all of that if you 're not worried about some of the energy challenges nor does she live in beverly hills what that means is we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data there 's another challenge that not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about and that is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment she people like her her ancestors have not had the best experiences at the hands of doctors and the hospital or insurance companies and jane cannot be fooled she reads the news she knows that if the we had an epiphany rather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation run in the cloud and so when we integrate these things together what this means is that now we can think about the future she can be monitored it can be done in a way where she doesn 't have to get another job to pay her data plan and we can also address some of her concerns about privacy we 've accomplished this we 've begun to address some of these questions about privacy and we feel like well not so fast one of the things we have to remember as i mentioned earlier is that jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment we have to remember letting a doctor intervene if necessary is not the whole story do is to think about ways to have trusted parties serve as intermediaries between people like jane and her health care providers for example we 've begun to partner with churches and to think about nurses that are church members that come from that trusted community as patient advocates and health coaches to people like jane another thing we have going for us is that insurance companies increasingly are attracted to some of these ideas rather than paying ten dollars later when that baby is born prematurely and ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit one of the most expensive parts of a hospital this has been a long learning process for us this iterative process of breaking through and attacking one problem and not feeling totally comfortable and identifying the next problem has helped us go along this path of actually trying to not only innovate with this technology but make sure it can be used for people who perhaps need it the most we have to remember that human beings are using this technology and we have to be mindful that these human beings they have a face they have a name and a life and in the case of jane"
