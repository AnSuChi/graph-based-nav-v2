  "transcript": "my dad and he was officially diagnosed in two thousand and five now he 's really pretty sick he needs help eating he needs help getting dressed dressed he doesn 't really know where he is or when it is and it 's been really really hard and i 've spent the last decade watching him disappear my dad 's not alone there 's about and by two thousand and thirty they 're expecting that to double to seventy million that 's a lot of people and because of that fear we tend to do one of two things it has nothing to do with me it 's never going to happen to me i 'm i 'm keeping my mind active that 's what the research says you should do but the research also shows that there 's nothing that will one hundred percent protect you if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get you that 's what happened with my dad my dad was a bilingual college professor his hobbies were chess bridge and writing op eds he got dementia anyway if the monster wants you the monster 's gonna get i 'm changing what i do for fun let 's start with the hobbies it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself you can 't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don 't know who they are and reading is just about impossible when you care for someone with dementia and you get training they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar that turned out to be letting him fill out forms he 'll sign his name on every line he 'll check all the 'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers but it got me thinking what would my caregivers do with me i think about global health a lot so i 've been trying to learn to do things that are hands on i 've always liked to draw so i 'm doing it more even though i 'm really very bad at it i am learning some basic origami i can make a really great box and i 'm teaching myself to knit which so far i can knit a blob but you if i 'm actually good at it what matters is that my hands know how to do it because the more things that are familiar the more things my hands know how to do the more things that i can be happy and busy doing when my brain 's not running the show anymore easier for their caregivers to look after and i want to be as happy as i can for as long as i can a lot of people don 't know that alzheimer 's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms i 'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance so that when i start to lose it i finally the third thing i 'm trying to become a better person and he 's kind and loving now he and that love makes us want to be around him even now even when it 's so hard when you take away everything that he ever learned in this world his naked heart still shines and what i need now is to learn to be like that i need a heart so pure that if it 's stripped bare by dementia it will survive what i want is a cure in the next twenty years soon enough to protect me thank you"
