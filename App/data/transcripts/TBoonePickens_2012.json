  "transcript": "we have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy about opec oil and let me take you back one hundred years you 're probably thinking that was my birth year a hundred years ago we were looking at coal of course and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil we were looking for a fuel it was cheaper we selected crude oil over whale oil and some but as we moved on to the period now one hundred years later we 're back really at another decision point what is the decision point it so it 's pretty clear to me domestic ours give or take a few barrels every day and the cost annually is three trillion dollars that has got to be stopped now if you look at the cost of opec it cost seven trillion dollars on the milken institute study last year seven trillion dollars since but it 's the greatest transfer of wealth and it continues now when you look and with that we have found ourselves to be the world 's policemen and how are we i know the response to this i would bet there aren 't ten percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world raise your hand if you think you know why do we have eleven aircraft carriers do we have a corner on the market i 'm not sure if you look at where they 're located and on this slide it 's the red blobs on there there are five that are operating in the mid east and the rest of them are in the united states they just move back to the mid east and those come of the eleven we have are tied up in the mid east why why are they in the mid east they 're there to control keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available and the united states uses about twenty million barrels a day which is about twenty five percent of all the oil used everyday in the the slide you 're looking at here is one thousand nine hundred and ninety to two thousand and forty over that period you are going to double your demand and when you look at what we 're using the oil for seventy percent of it is used for i 'm for anything american you have to address and from the twelve five comes from opec we use twenty million barrels and the chinese use ten the chinese have we have no if you take the last ten years you 've transferred you will pay two point two trillion but the days of cheap oil are over they 're over they make it very clear to you the saudis do they have to have ninety four dollars a barrel to make their social commitments now i had people it 's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil there is no free market for oil the oil is priced off the margin and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil so where are we headed from here we 're headed natural gas will do everything we want it to do it 's one hundred and thirty octane fuel it 's ours we have an abundance of it and it does not require a refinery it comes out of the ground at one hundred and thirty octane run it through the separator and you 're ready to use it it 's going to be very simple for us to use it 's going to be simple to accomplish this 're going to find and i 'll tell you in just a minute what you 're looking for but here you can look at the list natural gas will fit all of those it will replace or be able to be used for that look at the bar on the left trillion it 's what we use a year go forward and the estimates that you have from the eia and onto the industry estimates the industry knows what they 're talking about we 've got four thousand trillion cubic feet of natural gas that 's available to us how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent it would be three times what the saudis claim they have and they claim they have two hundred and fifty billion barrels of oil which i do not believe i think it 's probably so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas and where i 've targeted is on of them you take eight million trucks reduce carbon by thirty percent it is cheaper so you will cut sixty percent off of opec with eight million trucks there are two hundred and fifty million vehicles in america i don 't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age because you have plenty of natural gas but as i said i 'm for anything american now let me take you i 've been a realist i went from theorist early to realist i 'm back to theorist if that 's the way you 're going to go so it 's up to you but we do have plenty of methane hydrates so i think i 've made my point that if we do it 's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil and yet we have no energy plan so there 's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight thank you plan that was based on wind energy and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed what happened tbp i lost one hundred and fifty today it 's two dollars and forty cents you cannot do a wind deal under six dollars an mcf ca so what happened was that through increased which made wind uncompetitive which were the carboniferous shales in the basins the first one was barnett shale in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across new york pennsylvania west virginia and haynesville in louisiana louisiana this stuff is everywhere we are overwhelmed with natural gas ca and now you 're a big investor in in that and bringing that to market tbp well you say a big investor it 's my life i 'm a geologist got out of school in ' fifty one and i 've been in the industry my entire life now i do own stocks i 'm not a big natural gas producer somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states don 't i wish but no i 'm not you burn it you release what do you have to replace it no no the argument that it 's a bridge fuel makes sense because the amount of co2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal correct and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas but if that if that 's it and and that becomes the reason that renewables don 't get invested in screwed anyway right tbp well i 'm not ready to give up but jim and i talked there as he left and i said how do you feel you 've made the money you need you 're one of the few people in a position to do you support the idea of of some kind of don 't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program i can tell you it will be a failure the government is not successful on these things they just aren 't it 's a bad deal look at solyndra or whatever it was i mean that was told to be a bad idea ten times they went ahead and did it anyway i think it 's closer to a i think where we 're headed and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be one don 't build a reformer on a fault of methane leaking from that methane being a worse global warming gas than age was i got out of school in ' fifty one i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in one thousand i don 't know what in the hell he 's talking about the first frack job was in ' forty seven i saw my first one in ' fifty three i now hundred thousand wells fracked in oklahoma texas kansas in that aquifer i don 't understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania ca all right so you don 't support a carbon tax of any kind or a it 's a bridge fuel even if they aren 't maximized for profits they might be maximized for the future health of the planet tbp i lost one hundred and fifty million on the wind and anything american will work for me ca boone thank you so much"
