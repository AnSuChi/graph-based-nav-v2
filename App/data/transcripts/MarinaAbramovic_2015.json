  "transcript": "there is the gallery somewhere in the world age twenty three standing in the middle of the space in the front of her is a table on the table there pleasure and for pain some of the objects are a glass of water a coat a shoe the hammer and the pistol with i 'm an object you can use everything on the table on me i 'm taking all responsibility even killing me and the time is six hours the beginning of this performance was easy and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood and i still have the scar the women would tell the men what to do and the men didn 't rape me because and they were with their wives and somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple and another person started walking i was half naked i was full of blood and tears were running down my face and then what happened is and welcome to the performance world let 's explain what the performance is but my explanation for performance is very simple performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens the audience and the difference between performance and theater is huge in the theater the knife is not a knife and the razor blade all about because you can 't do we 're and with this energy i can go and push my body if i can do this for myself you can do it for you after belgrade where i was so to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart so heart beating and adrenaline is rushing and so on is about trust is about total trust to another human being ours went too we didn 't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say you know this is over we walked each of us three months it was going through the twelve chinese provinces this was before china was open in and we succeeded to meet in the middle and one very important piece i made in those days was balkan baroque and this was the time of the balkan and i wanted to create some very strong charismatic image something that could serve for any war at any time because the balkan wars are now finished but there 's always some war somewhere so here i am washing you never can wash shame off the wars so i 'm washing this six hours six days and wars are coming which i just recently made this performance when i said to the curator i 'm just going to sit at the chair and there will be an empty chair at the front and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as this chair will be empty nobody has time to sit in front of you and this changed everything this performance maybe ten or fifteen years ago nothing would have happened but the need of people to actually and finally they sit they are observed by the other because in the gaze with that total stranger that you never even say one word and i understood that have a very strong mission that i have to communicate this experience and this is how for me was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts because thinking about immateriality performance is time based art it 's not like a painting you have the painting on the wall only have the memory music is the highest and then after this is performance and then everything else that 's my subjective way rem koolhaas an idea and it 's very simple if you want to you have to give me your word of honor it 's something so old fashioned but if you don 't respect your own word of honor and you leave before that 's not my problem but it 's six hours the and then after you finish you get a certificate of accomplishment so get home and frame it if you want this is orientation hall the public comes in and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats it and then you go to the the lockers and you put your watch your iphone your ipod your computer and everything digital electronic because there is nothing wrong with technology first you start slow you start slowing down you 're going back to simplicity drinking water for maybe half an hour after crystal chamber you go to and then after you 've seen all of this and prepared yourself mentally and physically then you are ready to see something with a long duration you go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable long duration chairs you 're transported to the big place where you 're going to see the the work and if you fall asleep which is very possible because it 's been a long day you 're going to be transported to the parking lot and and then after this you just and this is to experience a kind of simple method how you go back to simplicity in your own life counting rice will be another thing you know you go through this whole range of being bored being and then this unbelievable amount of when satisfying work is finished or counting sand in the desert or having the we are always and this is why you 're not changing if you don 't go into that area and you don 't fail you are actually repeating yourself over and over again and i think that human beings right now need a change and the only change to be made is a personal level change you have to make the change on yourself because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us is to start with yourself it 's so easy to criticize how it 's different the things the governments are corrupted and there 's hunger in the world but what we do on the personal level what is our contribution to this whole thing and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes right now i 'm asking two minutes of your time that 's so little breathe slowly don 't try to blink don 't be in his eyes you for trusting me"
