  "transcript": "a few months ago a forty year old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where i live and she was brought in confused her blood pressure was an alarming two hundred and thirty over one hundred and seventy whisked over to a cat scan suite right next to the emergency room but it showed visible palpable breast masses breast tumors four or five opportunities intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her it happens all the time but i 'd like to make the case to you in the next seventeen minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam when we lean towards we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable early stage but we 're losing much more than that we 're losing a ritual but i 'd like to introduce you and that is the power of the human hand to touch to comfort to diagnose and to bring about treatment i 'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize this is sir arthur conan doyle and his character sherlock holmes was inspired and conan doyle writing about bell described the following exchange between bell and his students so picture bell sitting in the outpatient students all around him patients signing up in the emergency room and being registered and being brought in and conan doyle describes the following exchange the woman says good morning bell says what sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from burntisland she says it was good and he says what did you do with the other child she says i left him with my sister at leith and he says and did you take the shortcut down inverleith row to get here to the infirmary she says i did and he says would you still be working at the linoleum factory and she says i am and bell then goes on to explain to the students he says you see when she said ' good morning ' i picked up her fife accent and the nearest ferry crossing from fife is from burntisland she must have taken the ferry over you notice that the coat she 's carrying is too small for the child who is with her and therefore she started out the journey with two children but dropped one off along the way except in the she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland but you might not realize that our ability to look the picture i 'm showing you is of leopold auenbrugger and his father used to go down into the basement to tap on the sides of casks of wine to determine how much wine and so when auenbrugger became a physician he began to do the same thing he began to tap on the chests of his patients on their abdomens and basically everything we know about percussion which you can think of as an ultrasound of its day abdominal changes all of this he described in this wonderful manuscript except for the fact that this physician corvisart a famous french physician famous only because he was physician to this gentleman and it was followed a year or two later by laennec discovering the stethoscope and laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called the cylinder later he renamed it the stethoscope surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis if you 'll recall prior to that time no matter what ailed you you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you bleeding you purging you and oh yes if you wanted he would give you a haircut short on the sides long in the back and pull your tooth he made no attempt at diagnosis in fact some of you might well know that the barber pole the red and white stripes represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon and the receptacles on either end represent the pots in which the blood was collected i think represents the pinnacle the peak of that clinical era this is a very famous painting the doctor by luke fildes and it 's interesting that fildes picked this topic fildes ' oldest son philip at the age of nine on christmas eve after a brief illness and fildes was so taken by the physician who held vigil at the bedside for two three nights what would fildes have done had he been asked to paint this painting in the modern era in the year two thousand and eleven would he have substituted a computer screen i 've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer i call it the the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america the real patient often wonders where is everyone when are they going to come by and explain things to me who 's in charge there 's a real disjunction between the patient 's perception and our own perceptions as physicians of the best medical care i want to show you a picture of what rounds looked like the focus was now i 've been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that i want to share with one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer and she then spent a lot of time researching to find the best cancer center in the world to get her subsequent care which is why i was surprised a few months later to see her back in our own town getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist and i pressed her and i asked her why did you come back and get your care here and she was reluctant to tell me she said the cancer center was wonderful it had a beautiful facility giant atrium valet parking a piano that played itself a concierge that took you around from here to there but she said but they did not touch my breasts now you and i could argue that they probably did not need to touch her breasts they had her scanned inside out they understood her breast cancer at the molecular level they had no need to touch her breasts but to her it mattered examined both breasts including examined her cervical region her inguinal region did a thorough exam and to her that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed stanford i had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue i say that because these are difficult patients they have often been rejected by their families have had bad experiences with medical care and they come to you fully prepared for you to join the long list of people who 's about to and i learned very early on with my first patient and so i hit on this method where i invited the patient to tell me the story for their entire first visit tried not to interrupt them and when the patient came for the physical i like to think that i do and i remember my very first patient in that series and i began my ritual i always begin with the pulse then i examine the hands then i look at the nail beds then i slide my hand up to and i remember having a very eerie sense that the patient and i had slipped back into a primitive ritual in which i had a role and the patient had a role and when i was done the patient said to me with some awe i have never been examined like this before now if that were true it 's a true condemnation once the patient was dressed the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions which is this is not in your head the good news it 's not cancer it 's not tuberculosis the bad news is we don 't know exactly what 's causing this but here 's what you should do here 's what we should do and i always felt that if the magic and began with me on a course towards wellness it was because i had earned the right i took this to my colleagues at stanford in anthropology we marry for with great pomp and ceremony and expense to signal our departure from a life of solitude and misery and loneliness to one of eternal bliss i 'm not sure why you 're laughing that was the original intent was it not we signal the passage of a life well i would submit to you that the ritual of one individual coming to another and then incredibly on top of that and if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown by not doing a complete exam you have bypassed on the opportunity i am a writer and i want to close by reading you a short passage that i wrote that has to do very much with this scene i 'm an infectious disease physician and in the early days of hiv before we had our medications i presided over so many scenes every time i went to a patient 's deathbed whether in the hospital or at home i remember my my sense of failure i don 't know what i can say i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do and out of that sense of failure i remember i would always i remember so many i remember so many huge hollowed out haunted eyes staring up at me and then the next and i wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient when he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth his hands moved as if in slow motion it was an offering i did not decline i percussed i palpated neither of us could skip this ritual which had nothing forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician necessary for the patient forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient i will be with you through the end"
