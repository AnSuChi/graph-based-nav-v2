  "transcript": "like the actor idris elba or at except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger this man ran across four lanes of freeway traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety but it also left me with this kind of gnawing need to understand why he did it what forces within him caused him to make the choice that i owe my life to to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger in other words and i discovered why you 're not supposed to do that i hit the dog anyways and that sent the car until finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic but i didn 't because of the actions of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life and then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety and made sure i was going to be all right he drove off again he and i 'm pretty sure i forgot to say thank you so before i go any further i really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you to that stranger i tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree i became a psychology researcher and i 've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others does it come from and how does it develop and what are the extreme forms that it can take these questions are really important to understanding basic aspects of human social nature a lot of people and this includes everybody from philosophers and economists to ordinary people but if that 's true why do some people answering this question requires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism but until recently very little work on this topic had been done the actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent which is a voluntary costly behavior motivated by the desire to help another individual so it 's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other what could possibly explain an action like that but then the question becomes why do some people seem to have more of it than others but to figure out how i actually started from the opposite end with psychopaths and psychopaths are exactly such a group and it results in a personality that 's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior once my colleagues and i at the national institute of mental health conducted some of the first ever brain imaging research of psychopathic and in particular they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one and they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help people who see them so it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues the part of the brain that 's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala and whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions so all of these findings are reliable but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people don 't care about others it 's understanding why they do which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy a sort of an amygdala that 's more reactive to this expression and maybe larger than average as well so these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery so that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed they 're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress so together what these data suggest is the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world and at the other by people who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they 're more compassionate than average they are but what 's even more unusual about them is that they 're compassionate and altruistic not just towards people who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family right because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with is not extraordinary truly extraordinary altruists and i 've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion and i found it 's a really difficult i say how is it that you 're willing to do this thing when so many other people don 't you 're one of fewer than two thousand americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger what is it that makes you so special and what do they say they say nothing i 'm just the same as everybody else because it suggests that the circles of these altruists don 't look like this they look more like this they have no center these altruists literally don 't think of themselves as being at the center of anything as being better or more inherently important than anybody else when i asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her she said because it 's not about me another said your study here is going to find out that i 'm just the same as you i think the best description for this amazing lack of and why is that but i also think that this is a view of the world that 's attainable by many and maybe even most people expansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere and it 's led to increases in all kinds of a hundred years ago people would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today maybe so what 's at the root of all these amazing changes in part it seems to be as societies become wealthier and better off people seem to turn their focus of attention outward and as a result all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations but which is that even as the world is becoming a better which it 's not and so we now care a lot more about the suffering but what 's clear is the kinds of changes we 're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence maybe even more so i really believe that the ability to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle thank you"
