  "transcript": "and for the last actually for ten years i feel like there 's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress so this is the first outfit change on the ted stage so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it i think if some of the women were really horrified when i came out you don 't have to tell me now but i 'll find out later on twitter note that i 'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me so good thing i wasn 't going to wear them so don 't do anything while it 's over my head why did i do that that was awkward well image is powerful but also image is superficial and in in this picture i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life i was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy 's hair and of course barring surgery or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work there 's very little that we can do to transform how we look though it is superficial and immutable has a huge impact on our lives so today for me being fearless means being honest and i am on this stage because i am a model i am on this stage because i am a pretty in my industry we call that a sexy girl so the first question is how do you become a model i always just say oh i was scouted but that means nothing the real way that i became a model and maybe you 're wondering what is a legacy well for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as and femininity and white skin and this is a legacy that was built for me and it 's a legacy that i 've been cashing out on and i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like wen and first i commend you on your model knowledge very impressive but unfortunately i have to inform you that in two thousand and seven a very inspired nyu ph d student counted and of the six hundred and seventy seven models that were hired only twenty seven or the next question people always ask is can i be a model when i grow up and the first answer is i don 't know they don 't put me in charge of that but the second answer and what i really want to say to these little girls is why you know you can be anything you could be the president of the united states or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet which would be awesome because you 'd be the first one because i 'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor in chief of american vogue or the ceo of h & m or the next steven meisel saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up it 's and it 's not a career path because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons it can just be distilled right now so the light is right there like a nice hmi and the client says we want a walking shot this leg goes first nice and long this arm goes back this arm goes forward the head is at three quarters and you just go back and forth just do that and then you look back at your imaginary it will look something like this hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle that was i don 't know what happened there unfortunately after you 've gone to school and you have a rsum and you 've done a few jobs you can 't say anything anymore so but your rsum reads underwear but that is only a small component of what 's happening but i was a young girl this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier here 's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come here 's me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue here 's me on the soccer team and in v magazine and i hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me they are constructions and they are constructions by a group of professionals by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and the next question people always ask me is do you get free stuff i do have too many 8 inch heels which i never get to wear except for earlier but the free stuff that i get is the free stuff that i get in real life and that 's what we don 't like to talk about i grew up in cambridge and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free when i was a teenager i was with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course we got pulled over and all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way and i got these free things because of how i look not who i am and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are i live in new york and last year of the one hundred and forty thousand teenagers that were stopped and frisked and latino and most of them were young men and there are only one hundred and seventy seven thousand young black and latino men in new york so for them it 's not a question of will i get stopped but how many times will i get stopped when will i get stopped i found out that of the 13 year old girls in the united states so the last question people ask me is what is it like to be a model and i think the answer that they 're looking for is if you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair you will be so happy and fabulous and it 's amazing to get to work with and those things are true but they 're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera that i have never said on camera is i am insecure and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day and if you ever are wondering if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair will i be happier you just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes and they 're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say look i 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with and it doesn 't always make me happy but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy but i 'm also happy and honored to be up here and i think that it 's great that i got to come or maybe i wouldn 't tell the story of how i paid for college which seems so important right now takeaway to this talk i hope it 's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures"
