  "transcript": "this is such an honor and it 's wonderful to be in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world and i 'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was i 'd finished with religion frankly and but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes one after the other and finally found myself in television was doing some rather controversial religious programs this went down very well in the u k i was finally in the mainstream i got sent to jerusalem to make a i encountered the other religious traditions judaism and islam the sister religions of christianity and while i found i knew nothing about these faiths at all despite my own intensely religious background seen judaism only as a kind of prelude to christianity and i knew nothing about islam at all where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together you also become aware of the profound connection between them and it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back to a sense of what religion can be and actually enabled me to look at my own faith in a different and i found some astonishing things in the course of my study that had never occurred to me frankly in the days when i thought i 'd had it with religion i just found the whole thing absolutely incredible these doctrines seemed unproven studying other traditions i began to realize that belief which we make such a fuss about today is only a very recent religious enthusiasm that surfaced only in the west in about the it narrowed its focus for reasons that i 'm exploring in a book i 'm writing at the moment to include to to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions a credo i believe it did not mean i accept certain creedal articles of faith i engage myself indeed some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy in the quran religious opinion religious orthodoxy is dismissed as zanna self indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian and then you begin to understand the truths of religion religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action you only understand them when you put them into practice now pride of place in this practice is given to compassion and it is an arresting fact that right across the board in every single one of the major world faiths compassion the ability to feel with the other in the way we 've been thinking about this evening is not only the test of any true religiosity it is also what will bring us into the presence of what jews christians and muslims call god or the divine which brings you to nirvana why because in compassion when we feel with the other we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put another person there and and in particular every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted first propounded by confucius five centuries before christ do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you that he said was the central thread which ran through all his teaching and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day and it was the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called ren which was a transcendent experience in itself and this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms too there 's a famous story about the great rabbi hillel the older contemporary of jesus a pagan came to him and offered to convert to judaism if the rabbi could recite the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on go and study it and go and study it was what he meant he said in your exegesis you must make it clear that every single verse of the torah is a commentary a gloss upon the golden rule the great rabbi meir said that any interpretation of scripture which led to hatred and disdain saint augustine made exactly the same point and we must not leave an interpretation of scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life but now look at our world and we are living living in a world that is where terrorists cite quranic verses to justify their atrocities where instead of taking jesus ' words love your enemies endlessly using scripture as as a way of arguing with other people putting other people down throughout the ages human greed as a species for messing up wonderful things so the traditions also insisted and this is an important point i think that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group your own nation your own your own fellow countrymen you must have what one of the chinese sages called honor the stranger we formed you says the quran into tribes and nations and this again this universal outreach is getting subdued in the strident use of religion i 've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who when i say to them what i do for a living inform me that religion has been the cause of all the major world wars in history wrong the causes of our present woes are political but make no mistake about it religion is a kind of fault line and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region religion can get sucked in and become part of the problem our modernity has been exceedingly violent between one thousand nine hundred and fourteen and seventy million people died in europe alone as a result of armed conflict so many of our institutions even football which used to be a pleasant and it 's not surprising that religion too has been affected by this violent ethos there 's i think of religious illiteracy around people seem to think now equate religious faith with believing things as though that we call religious people often believers as though that were the main thing that they do and very often secondary goals get pushed into the first place in place of compassion and the golden rule because the golden rule is difficult i sometimes when i 'm speaking to congregations about compassion i sometimes see a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because a lot of religious people prefer to be right that 's not the whole story since september the 11th when my work on islam i 've been able to sort of go all over the world i 've just come back from pakistan and especially the young people were coming and were asking me the young people were saying what can we do what can we do to change my hosts in pakistan said look don 't be too polite to us tell us where we 're going going wrong let 's talk together about where religion is failing because it seems to me that with our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn 't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation and religion with its here in the united states people may be being religious in a different way as a report has just shown but they still want to be religious it 's only western europe that has retained its secularism old fashioned but people want to be religious and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world which it can and should be because of the golden rule do not do to others what you would not have them do to you an ethos that should now be applied globally we should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves and these whatever our wretched beliefs is a religious matter it 's a spiritual matter it 's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage here in the united states i think you see it in this election campaign a longing for change and people in in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after september the 11th coming together locally to create networks of understanding with the mosque with the synagogue saying speak to one another i think it 's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration i 'd there 's this comes from the iliad but it tells you what this spirituality should be you know the story in one incident achilles the famous warrior of greece takes his troops out of the war and in the course of the ensuing muddle his beloved friend patroclus is killed and achilles goes mad with grief and rage and he he mutilates the body kills which means that in greek ethos hector 's soul will wander and then one night priam king of troy an old man comes into the greek camp incognito makes his way to achilles ' tent to ask for the body of his son and achilles looks at him and priam looks at the man who has and the sound of their weeping filled the house the greeks and then achilles takes the body of hector he hands it very tenderly to the father and see each other as divine that is the ethos found too in all the religions it 's what is meant by and beginning to appreciate the other it 's of great importance that the word for here 's my wish i wish that you would help with the creation propagation of a charter for compassion and based on the fundamental principle of the golden rule we need to create a movement among all these people that too who want to join up in some way and reclaim their faith which they feel as i say has been hijacked we need and to give guidelines this charter would not be a massive i 'd like to see it to give guidelines as to how to interpret the scriptures these texts that are being abused remember what the rabbis and what augustine said about how scripture should be governed by the principle of charity let 's get back to that and the idea too of jews christians and muslims these traditions now so often at loggerheads working together to create document which we hope will be signed by a thousand at least of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world and you are the people i 'm just a solitary scholar despite the idea that i love a good time which i was rather amazed to see coming up i 've had some preliminary talks and archbishop desmond tutu for example is very happy to give his name to this as is imam feisal rauf the imam in new york city also i would be working with the alliance of civilizations at the united nations i was part of that united nations initiative called the alliance of civilizations which was asked by kofi annan to diagnose the causes to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism and the alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it the importance of this is that this is i can see some of you starting to look worried because you think it 's a slow and cumbersome body but what the united nations can do is give us some neutrality so that this isn 't seen as a western or a christian initiative but that it 's coming as it were from the united nations from the world who would help with the sort of"
