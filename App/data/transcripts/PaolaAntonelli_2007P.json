  "transcript": "but what we 're going to talk about today is really design and transform and so that gives me an opportunity because every design show that i curate and what i 'm going to do today is i 'm going to give you a preview of the next exhibition that i 'm working on which is called design and the elastic mind the world that i decided to focus on this particular time is and this is what this exhibition looks at if you think about your life you go every day through many different scales many different changes of rhythm and pace you work over different time zones you talk to very different people you multitask but nonetheless this is other people are not as elastic i can 't get my father in italy to work on the internet he doesn 't want to put high speed internet at home and that 's because there 's some little bit of fear little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms so designers work on this particular malaise that we have these kinds of discomforts that we have and try to make life easier for us elasticity of mind is something that we really and one last thing is that it 's not only designers but it 's also scientists and before i launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design but according to a really great science historian you might know peter galison he teaches at harvard what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics have brought to designers is this renewed interest this real passion for design so basically the idea of being able to build things bottom up atom by atom has made them all into tinkerers and all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers just like designers are seeking scientists it 's a brand new love affair that we 're trying to cultivate at moma together with adam bly who is the founder of seed magazine that 's now a multimedia company you might know it we founded about a year ago a monthly salon for designers and scientists and it 's quite beautiful and keith has come and also jonathan has come and many others scientists would tell designers you know i don 't know what style is i 'm not really and then all of a sudden they really started talking each others ' language and now we 're already at the point that they collaborate architects collaborated in an installation in london at the serpentine and it 's really interesting to see how this happens the exhibition will talk about the work of both designers and scientists and show how they 're presenting the possibilities of the future to us i 'm showing to you different sections of the show right now just to give you a taste of it nanophysics and nanotechnology for instance have really opened the designer 's mind in this case i 'm showing more the designers ' work because they but what you 're looking at here is the work of some scientists from ucla this kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins not only by color but literally by alphabet letters so they construct it and they can construct all kinds of forms at the nanoscale this is the work of design students from the royal college of arts in london that have been working together with their tutor tony dunne and with a bunch of scientists around great britain on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future new sensing elements on the body you can grow hairs on your nails and therefore grab some of the particles from another person they seem very very obsessed with finding out more about the ideal mate so they 're working on enhancing everything touch smell everything they can in order to find the perfect mate very is a typeface designer from israel who has designed he calls them typosperma he 's thinking of course it 's all a concept of injecting typefaces i don 't know how to say it in english spermatazoi in order to make them become to almost have a song or a whole poem written with every ejaculation in this case too you have a mixture of scientists and designers this here is part of the same lab at the royal college of arts the rca is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint one of the assignments for a year was to work with in vitro but the problem is that it 's a and so the assignment to the students was how should the steak of tomorrow be when you don 't have to kill cows and it can have any shape what should it be like so this particular student james king went around the beautiful english countryside picked the best best cow that he could see and then put her in the mri machine food maker but you know in the future it could be made better which reproduces the best mri scan of the best cow he could find instead this element here is much more banal something that you know can be done already is to grow bone tissue so that you can make a wedding ring out of the bone tissue of your loved one literally so but it 's a real coat it 's shaped like one so we 'll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future one of the most important topics of the show you know as anything in our life today we can look at it from many many different viewpoints and at different levels we change scale very often we change resolution of screens and we 're not really fazed by it we do it very so you go even in the exhibition from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale to the manipulation of really great amounts of data the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world this is human vs chimps the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps it was a beautiful visualization that he did for seed magazine and here 's the whole code of pac man visualized with all the and then also graphs by scientists this beautiful diagraph of protein homology scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics we were discussing with keith shrubb * this morning so they pick the worst background from any kind of powerpoint presentation the worst typeface it 's only recently that this kind of marriage between design and science is producing some of the first if we can say so scientific presentations another aspect of contemporary design that i think promising and will really be the future of design is the idea of collective design you know the whole the more computers the stronger the signal and children work on the interface so that it 's all based on doing things together tasks together so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future and this is chosen as an example related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance between the individual and the collectivity is the idea of existence maximum that 's a term that i coined a few create bubbles of space around us that enable us to have and this is the work of several designers that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion by means of various techniques this is a spa telephone the idea is that it 's become so difficult to have a private conversation and then you have this beautiful pool with this perfect temperature and you can have this isolation tank phone conversation with whomever you 've been wanting to talk with for a long time and same thing here social but it 's the idea of being able to be somewhere else with your senses while you 're removed from it physically and this is called blind date it 's a [ unclear ] so if you 're too shy to be really at the date you can stay at a distance with your flowers technology and design are i think bound to change the world you 've heard about it before many times rapid manufacturing is a computer file sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine it used to be called rapid prototyping rapid modeling it started out in the ' 80s but at the beginning it was machines carving out of a foam block a model that was very very fragile and the materials became better better resins techniques became better not only carving but also stereolithography and laser solidifying all kinds of resins whether in powder or in liquid form and the vats became bigger to the point that now we can have actual chairs made by rapid manufacturing customize your chair you know companies and designers will be designing the matrix and then you can send it to the kinko 's store at the corner and go get your chair the implications of this are enormous not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process but also no tracking no warehousing no wasted materials also i can imagine many design manufacturers will have to retool their own business plans but it really is a big change and here i 'm showing a picture that was in wired magazine you know the artifacts of the future section that i love so much that shows you can have your desktop 3d printer and print your own basketball but here instead are examples you can already 3d print textiles which is very interesting this is just a really nice touch it 's called slow prototyping it 's a designer that put ten thousand bees at work and they built this vase they had a particular shape that they had to stay in mapping and tagging as the capacity of computers becomes really really big and the capacity of our mind not that again this communal sense of experience that seems to be so important today so various ways to map and tag are also and also animal senses in a way and so much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer bees can be trained by pavlovian reflex and so this student at the rca designed this beautiful blown glass object where the bees move from one chamber another shape is made for cancer design for debate is a very interesting but rather they design scenarios that are object based they 're still very useful they help companies and other designers think better about the future this is quite beautiful it 's dunne and raby all the robots those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of we always think that robots will take care of us and instead they designed these robots that are very very needy you need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes for about five minutes before it does something another one gets really really nervous if you get the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup what you miss the most are those annoying things this one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night then there 's another one that breathes on your neck there 's another one that throws plates and breaks them so it 's just this idea of what we really miss in life elio caccavale he he 's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation and also the spider gene into the goat from a few years ago he 's working for the exhibition because it 's not anymore mom the flowers and the bees and then there 's the baby no it can be two moms three dads in vitro there 's the the whole idea of how babies can be made today that has changed so it 's a series of dolls that he 's working on right now one of the most beautiful things is that designers really work on on life even though they take technology into account and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death these three objects over there are hard drives with a bluetooth connection but they 're in reality very very beautiful sculpted artifacts that contain the whole desktop and computer memory of somebody who passed away so instead of having only the pictures you will be able to put this object next to the computer and all of a sudden gertrude 's whole life and all of her files and her address book come alive"
