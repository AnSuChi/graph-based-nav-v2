  "transcript": "i soared through the galaxy driving a huge starship with a crew made up of people from all over this world many different races many different cultures and our mission was to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before am the grandson seeking new opportunities and i was born there i was four years old when pearl harbor was bombed on december seven one thousand nine the world was plunged into a world war america suddenly was swept up by american citizens of japanese ancestry were looked on with suspicion and fear and with outright hatred simply because we happened to look like the people that bombed pearl harbor and the hysteria grew and grew franklin delano roosevelt ordered all on the west coast of america to be summarily rounded up with no charges with no trial with no due process due process this is a core pillar of our justice we were to be rounded up and imprisoned in ten barbed wire prison camps and two of the most desolate places in california and they dressed us hurriedly and we saw two soldiers and the soldiers ordered us out of our home my father gave and we walked out and stood on the driveway waiting for our mother to come out and when my mother never be able to forget that scene it is burned into my memory we were taken from our home and loaded on to train cars with other japanese american families there were guards stationed at both ends of each car rocking on that train for four days i remember the tall sentry tower but to too young to understand the circumstances of my being there children are amazingly adaptable what would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps it became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall it became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower being in a prison a my normality but los angeles was not a welcoming place and the hostility was intense first home was on skid row in the lowest part of living with derelicts drunkards and crazy people the stench of urine all over on the street i remember once and threw up let 's go back home because behind barbed wires was for us we had lost everything they were at the middle of their lives and and i was all men are created equal we have an inalienable right and i couldn 't quite make that fit with what i knew to be my childhood imprisonment and i couldn i couldn 't find anything about it and so i engaged my father after dinner in long sometimes heated conversations we had many many conversations like that and what i got from them was my father 's wisdom he was the one that suffered the most under those and yet he understood american democracy he told me that our democracy is a people 's democracy and it can be as great as the people can be but it is also as fallible as people are he told me that american democracy democracy is vitally dependent on good people who cherish the ideals of our system and he took me to a campaign headquarters the governor of illinois was running for the presidency and introduced me to american and he also told me about young when pearl harbor was bombed young like all young americans rushed to their draft board to volunteer to fight for our country that act of patriotism was answered with a slap in the face we were denied service and categorized as enemy but that was compounded with the word took the word citizen away from us and imprisoned and as suddenly as they 'd rounded us up they opened up the military for the astounding thing is that thousands of young japanese american men and women leaving their families in they said that they were going to fight not only to get but because they cherished the very ideal of what our government stands for should stand for and that was being abrogated by what was being done and they went to fight for they were put into a segregated all unit and they threw themselves into it they were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any proportionally there is one battle that illustrates that rocky hillside in impregnable caves and they were stalemated the 442nd was called in to add to the fight but the men of the 442nd came up with a unique the germans thought thought an attack from the backside would be impossible the men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible moonless night they began scaling that rock wall a drop of more than one thousand feet in full combat gear all night long on that sheer cliff in the darkness some lost their handhold or their footing they all fell silently not a single one cried out so as not to give their position away the men climbed for eight hours and those who made it to the top and they took the hill and broke the gothic line it was an amazing act and when the war ended they were greeted back on the white house lawn by president truman who said to them and you won they are my heroes they clung and they proved that being an american is not just for some people that race is not including and they left for me a legacy they are my heroes and my father is my hero who understood democracy and and guided me through it and i am dedicated to making my country an even better america to making our government an even truer democracy and because of the heroes that i have and the struggles that we 've gone through i can stand before you as a gay thank you very much"
