  "transcript": "so let me start by taking you back back into the mists of your memory but certainly the most anticipated year in all remember that i think by many that the millennium that the year two thousand should mean more more than just a two and some zeroes our world leaders actually lived up to that millennium moment and back in two thousand agreed to some pretty extraordinary stuff visionary measurable long term targets called the millennium development goals the deal agreed then goes like and developed nations promised to help them get that done well we 're approaching two thousand and fifteen so what does the world want to do together we 've got to decide a process by which we decide incredible partnerships between the private sector political leaders philanthropists and amazing grassroots activists across the developing world but also increased the number of people on and combined this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year last year than in the year two thousand that 's five because of all of these partnerships news is probably the subject of a different tedtalk and one hundred and seventy eight million kids are malnourished to the point of stunting a horrible term which means physical and cognitive so there 's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we 've got but then a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren 't agreed back then that should now be included like sustainable development targets access to opportunity to knowledge fighting corruption but the key thing here is what do you think should be in the new goals what do you want are you annoyed that i didn 't talk about gender equality or or education should those be in the new package of goals and quite frankly that 's a good question but there 's going to be some tough tradeoffs and choices here so you want to hope that the process by which the world decides these new goals is going to be and currently they 're doing that through pretty much the same old elite closed process along with ubiquitous reality tv formats have spread all around the world so what we 'd like to propose is that we use them to involve people from all around the world in an historic first the world 's first truly global poll and consultation i mean wouldn 't it be a huge historic missed opportunity not to do this given that we can there 's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake so first of all we 've got to ground this campaign in core polling data let 's go into every country that will let us in one people what they want the new goals to be making special efforts to reach the poorest those without access to modern technology and let 's make sure that their views are at the center of the goals going forward then we 've got to commission a baseline survey to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals going forward the original goals didn 't really have good baseline telecoms companies reality tv show formats telecoms all of them together in kind of their we are the world moment and if just five percent of the five billion plus who are currently connected made a comment well there 's some mostly piloted within africa actually there 's open data kenya which geocodes and crowdsources information about where projects are are they delivering results often they 're not in the right place and which geocodes and crowdsources information in complex emergencies to help target responses this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid i 've got a trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live our world leaders our global politics currently can 't get it done they need our help they need the cavalry and the cavalry 's not going to come from mars it 's got to come from us and i see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the i started and it 's true it was just a t shirt slogan that worked for the but look now sure progress in china and india and poverty reduction there was key to that as the poor will be increasingly located in but i 'm confident with the right kind of political campaigning and creative and technological innovation combined working together more and more as one was an incident today where a hundred kids died in some tragedy or where say a hundred kids were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces i mean it would be all over the news for a week right you just put up just as one of your numbers there that five thousand is that that the number and it 's invisible and we 're having a huge debate in this country about aid levels for example and aid alone is not the whole solution nobody thinks it is but you know if people saw the results of this smart aid i mean they 'd be going crazy for it i wish the two hundred and fifty thousand people who really did march outside this very building and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it because we have not creatively we 've failed to communicate this success so far if those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice and amplify it at the key moments i know for a fact we 'd get better policy rio if anyone cares about the environment need not have been the bits that are are making a difference i mean if the people here who 've had experience using open platforms you 're interested to talk with them this week and try to take this if that is really awesome so thank you"
