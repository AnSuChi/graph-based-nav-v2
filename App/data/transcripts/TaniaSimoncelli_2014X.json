  "transcript": "i was working at the aclu as the organization 's science advisor i so i wandered down the hallway to my colleague chris hansen 's office so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck i had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil to engage these issues in a much bigger way in a way that could really make a difference there 's genetic discrimination and oh there 's this really cool issue functional mri and using it for lie detection gene patents gene patents yes you know patents on human genes no you 're telling me that the us government has been issuing patents on part of the human body that can 't be right and but he knew almost nothing about patent law so clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene but the most controversial of these are to so called isolated dna namely a piece of dna that has been removed from a cell gene patent proponents say see we didn 't patent the gene in your but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated but on every possible version of that gene so what does that mean that means that you can 't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it say to see if it has any mutations without permission of the patent holder it also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing allowing patent holders often private companies to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients consider abigail with long qt syndrome a serious heart condition that if left untreated can result in sudden death but then they went bankrupt and they never offered it no test was available during that time abigail died of undiagnosed long qt gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients but was there a way we could challenge them turns out that the supreme court has made clear through a long line of cases that certain things are not patent eligible you can 't patent products of nature the air the minerals elements of the periodic table and you can 't patent laws of nature the law of gravity these things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none the most fundamental structure of life that codes for the production of all of our proteins regardless of whether it 's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube as we delved into this issue we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts lawyers patent lawyers most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy and at least in theory as a matter of law law all of them thought our chances of winning a gene patent challenge why is that well the patent office had been issuing these patents there were literally thousands of patents on human genes the patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo the biotech industry so the bottom line courts just weren 't going to be willing to overturn these patents now neither chris nor i were the type to shy away from a challenge and hearing being right just isn 't enough seemed all the more reason to take on this fight now patent cases tend to be company a sues company b over some really narrow obscure technical issue we weren 't really interested in that kind of case and we thought this case was much bigger than that this was about scientific freedom medical progress the rights of patients so we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case we set out to identify a gene patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation we found the prime candidate to sue in myriad genetics a company that 's based in salt lake city utah myriad held patents on two genes the and the brca2 genes women with certain mutations along these genes are considered to be at a significantly increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on brca testing in the united states myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in france it has been estimated that during that period for several years as many as twelve percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer a negative test result that should have been positive this is kathleen maxian kathleen 's sister eileen developed breast cancer at age forty and she was tested by myriad the test was negative and that other members of her family didn 't need to be tested advanced stage ovarian cancer it turned out that kathleen 's sister was among the twelve percent who received result had eileen received the proper result kathleen would have then been tested once we settled on myriad we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems we ended up with twenty highly committed plaintiffs genetic counselors who had received cease and desist letters four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than one hundred and fifty thousand scientists and medical professionals and individual women who either couldn 't afford myriad 's test or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not as a result of the one of the major challenges we had in preparing the case brca genes were products of nature we had to explain a couple of basic concepts like what 's a gene what 's dna how is dna isolated and why isn 't that we spent hours and hours so isolating dna it 's like extracting gold from a mountain or but you can 't patent the gold itself it might 've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain you still can 't patent it it 's still gold and the gold once it 's extracted can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn 't be used for when it was in the mountain you can make jewelry out of it for example we filed in federal court in the southern district of new york and the case was randomly assigned to judge robert sweet in march two thousand and ten judge sweet issued his opinion one hundred and fifty two pages and a complete victory for our side i mean but not this good so it turned out judge sweet 's clerk working for him at the time was not just a lawyer he was a scientist he was not just a scientist he had a phd in molecular biology what an incredible stroke of luck myriad then appealed to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit and here things got really interesting the us government but now in direct opposition to its own patent office and has concluded that isolated dna is not patent eligible this was a really big deal totally unexpected and it has a reputation for being and we did sort of the first one judge lourie made up his own novel biological theory totally wrong but she 's like i don 't want to shake up the biotech industry the third so now we sought review by the supreme court and when you when you petition the supreme court you have to present a question that you want the court to answer usually these questions take the form of a super long paragraph like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses wherein this and therefore that four words i want the justices to have the very same reaction that i had when you brought this issue to me seven and it was really really exciting long line of people outside people had been standing in line since two thirty in the morning to try to get into the courthouse two breast cancer organizations breast cancer action and force had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps chris and i sat quietly in the hallway moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career i was clearly more nervous than he was but any remaining panic subsided as i walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical patient advocacy environmental and religious organizations who had submitted friend of the court also in the room were three leaders the human genome project including the co discoverer of dna himself james watson who had submitted a brief to the court where he referred to gene patenting as lunacy the diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality the argument itself was but for me the most thrilling aspect was watching the supreme court justices grapple with isolated dna through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years justice sotomayor proclaimed isolated dna to be just nature sitting there but i could never have anticipated the outcome nine to zero a naturally occurring dna segment is a product of nature and not merely because it has been isolated and furthermore myriad did not create anything some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than myriad 's some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one myriad was offering but of course it clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and it helps to ensure that patients like abigail kathleen and eileen have access to the tests that they need a few weeks after the court issued its decision i received a small package in the mail it was from bob cook deegan a professor at duke university i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing the process took nearly eight years from the start to finish with many twists and turns along the way"
