  "transcript": "i think this is partially due to my father who was blind it was a fact that he didn 't make much of a fuss about usually one time in nova scotia when we went to see a total eclipse of the sun one as in the carly simon song which warren beatty or mick jagger we 're not really sure they handed out these dark plastic viewers that allowed us to look directly at the sun without damaging our eyes but dad got really scared he didn 't want us doing that he wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers so that there was no chance at that our eyes would be damaged when he and his sister martha were just very little their mom took them out to see a total eclipse or actually a solar eclipse decades later it turned out that the source of their blindness was most likely some sort of as near as we can tell it had nothing whatsoever to do with that solar eclipse but by then my grandmother had already gone to her grave thinking it was her fault where the first shots were fired against the british in one thousand seven hundred and seventy five although we didn 't actually hit any of them until concord which was part of the route one axis in those days so the equivalent of silicon valley in the ' 70s although they did let him get through the army physical exam before they got to the very last test which was for vision so dad started racking up all of these patents and gaining a reputation as a blind genius rocket scientist inventor but to us he was just dad and our home life was pretty normal but at the age of fourteen a friend got me interested in comic books and i decided that was what i wanted to do for a living he 's an engineer and he 's a military contractor so one grows up to become a computer scientist one grows up to join the navy one grows up to become an engineer and then there 's me the comic book artist makes me the opposite of dean kamen because i 'm a comic book artist son of an inventor and he 's an inventor son of a comic book artist right it 's true the funny thing is dad had a lot of faith in me he had faith in my abilities as a cartoonist even though he had no direct evidence that i was any good whatsoever everything he saw was just a blur now this gives a real meaning to the term blind faith which doesn 't have the same negative connotation for me that it does for other people but there 's a middle ground too a middle ground tread by people like poor old charles babbage and his steam driven computers that were never built we can that 's not the point he understood the shape of the future so did j c r licklider and his notions for computer human interaction same thing he understood the shape of the future even though it was something that would only be or paul baran and his vision for packet switching hardly anybody listened to him in his day or even the people who actually pulled it off the people at bolt beranek and newman in boston who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network and sketching things on the back of napkins and and on note papers and arguing over dinner at howard johnson 's on route one hundred and twenty eight in lexington massachusetts just two miles from where i was studying the queen 's gambit deferred and listening to gladys knight & the pips singing midnight train so three types of vision right the vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained and this third kind a vision of something which which may be based on knowledge but is as yet unproven it 's true in politics it 's even true in personal endeavors follow no one and work like hell i think these are the four principles that go into this and it 's that third one where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves i know that it results in sort of a formalist attitude towards trying to understand how it works authenticity of human experience and honesty and rawness these are four very different ways of looking at the world i even gave them names the classicist the animist the formalist and iconoclast interestingly they seem to correspond more or less to jung 's four subdivisions of human thought and if you go on the diagonal you get content and form and then beauty and it probably applies just as much to music and movies and fine art which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all or for that matter nothing to do with our conference theme of inspired by nature except to the extent of the fable of the frog who gives a ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river because the scorpion promises not to sting him but the thing was i saw that the route i took to discovering this focus in my in my work and who i was i saw it as as just this this road to discovery actually it was just so what does a scientific mind do in the arts but i also started trying to understand them almost immediately one of the most important things about comics that i discovered was that comics are a visual medium but they try to embrace all of the senses within it the different elements of comics like pictures and words and the different symbols and everything in between that comics presents are all funneled through the single conduit a vision but still retaining the complete meaning put all these three together and you have a nice little map of the entire boundary of visual iconography and if you move to the right you also get language because that 's abstracting even further from resemblance but still maintaining meaning vision is called upon to represent sound and to understand the common properties of those two and their common heritage as well also to try to represent the texture of sound to capture its essential character through visuals and then gives you something to imagine between the panels also another sense which comics ' vision represents and that 's time sequence is a very important aspect of comics but i was wondering if perhaps it also energizes other sorts of forms and i found some in history whether it 's paint on stone like the tomb of menna the scribe in ancient egypt or a bas relief sculpture rising up a stone column or a 200 foot long embroidery or painted deerskin and tree bark running across what 's interesting is once you hit print and this is from one thousand four hundred and fifty by the way all of the artifacts of modern comics start to present themselves rectilinear panel arrangements simple line drawings without tone and a and it was just a little thing it wasn 't good for much except text entry but my father had told me about moore 's law back in the and so i kept my eyes peeled to see if the sort of changes that happened when we went from pre print comics to print comics would happen when we went beyond to post print comics so one of the first things proposed was that we could mix the visuals of comics with the sound motion and interactivity of the and one of the first things they did was they tried to take the comics page as is and transplant it to monitors which was a classic mcluhanesque mistake of appropriating the shape of the previous technology as the content of the new technology and so what they would do is have these comic pages that resemble print comics pages and they would introduce all this sound and motion the problem was that if you go with this basic idea that space equals time in comics what happens is that when you introduce sound and motion which are temporal phenomena that can only be represented through time they break with that continuity of presentation interactivity was another thing there were hypertext comics but the thing about hypertext is that everything in hypertext is either here not here or connected to here it 's profoundly nonspatial the distance from abraham lincoln to a lincoln penny to penny marshall to the marshall plan to plan nine to nine lives it 's all the same laughter but in comics in comics and i found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that i was showing you each of them has a single unbroken whether it 's going zigzag across the walls or spiraling up a column or just straight left to right or even going in a backwards zigzag across those the same thing is happening that is that the basic idea that as you move through space you move through time is being carried out without any compromise but there were compromises when print hit so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again and i thought ok well if that 's true is there any way when we go beyond today 's print to somehow bring that back the monitor is just as limited as the page technically right it 's a different shape but other than that it 's the same basic limitation but not if you look at the along the x axis and the y axis and staircases we could do circular narratives that were literally circular we could do a turn in a story that was literally a turn parallel narratives could be literally parallel y and also z so i had all these notions this was back in the in the late ' 90s and other people in my business thought i was pretty crazy but a lot of people then went on and actually did it i 'm going to show you a couple now this was an early collage comic by a fellow named jasen lex and notice what 's going on here what i 'm searching for is a durable mutation that 's what all of us are searching for as media head into this we are looking for mutations that are durable that have some sort of staying power but even though even though we 're only experiencing it one piece as the technology evolves as you get full immersive displays and whatnot this sort of thing will only grow it will adapt it will adapt to its environment it 's a durable mutation this is by drew weing this is called ' pup ' ponders the heat death of the universe see what 's going on here as we draw these stories on an infinite canvas is you 're creating a more pure expression of what this medium is all about we 'll go by this a little quickly you get the idea i just want to get to the last panel just one more talk about your infinite canvas it 's by a guy named daniel merlin goodbrey in britain"
