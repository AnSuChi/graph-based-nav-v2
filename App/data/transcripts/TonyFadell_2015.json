  "transcript": "there 's a scene where john belushi it 's a cramped tiny space and it 's just three feet away from the train tracks rattling everything in the room john asks how often does that train go by dan replies so often you won 't even notice it and then something falls off the wall we all know what he 's talking about as human beings we get used to everyday things really fast and try to improve upon them that sticker wasn 't there when i was a kid but somewhere as the years passed someone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit well that 's great we can get in and out of the store quickly but now there 's a new problem when we just want to pick it up and eat it and dig at it with our nails and then trying to flick it off your fingers it 's not fun not at all you probably felt those feelings you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit by the 10th time you started to become less less upset and you just started peeling the label off and then wondered was there another sticker so why is that why do we get used to everyday things well and so our brains encode the everyday things we do into habits it 's a process called habituation and it 's one of the most basic ways as humans we learn now habituation isn 't always bad the lights the pedestrians it 's a nerve wracking experience as the weeks driving became easier and easier you habituated it so there 's a good reason why our brains habituate things if we didn 't we 'd notice every little detail all the habituation isn 't good and if it stops us from noticing and fixing those problems well then that 's really bad comedians know all about this jerry seinfeld 's entire career was built on noticing those little details those idiotic things we do every day that we don 't even remember now we 've all been there see this this person this is mary anderson in one thousand nine hundred and two in new york it was a cold wet snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar as she was going to her destination she noticed the driver opening the window to clean off the the excess snow so he could drive safely when he opened the window though he let all this cold wet air inside making all the passengers miserable that 's just how it is but mary didn 't mary thought what if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside so that he could stay safe and drive and the passengers could actually stay warm so she picked up her sketchbook right then and there and began drawing what would become the world 's first windshield wiper i try to learn from people like mary to try to see the world the way it really is not the way we think it is now some people think you 're born with this ability or you 're not as if mary anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly steve jobs challenged us the one that has fears and possible frustrations and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster easier and seamless for the new customers so i remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the ipod see back in the 90s being a gadget freak like i am the one that said charge before use i just spent all this time buying this product and now i have to charge before use i have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy it you had to charge it well steve not going to let that happen to our product you run it for about thirty minutes in the factory to make sure that hard drive 's going to be working years later for the customer after they pull it out of the box we ran that product for over two hours we could make a higher quality product be easy ready to use so that customer people liked it today almost we noticed that that detail and we fixed it and now everyone else does that as well no more charge before use not just the obvious problem that 's important you see there are invisible problems all around us ones we can solve to feel them there 's far too many experienced people in the ted community who would know much more about that than i ever will that we all can do to fight habituation my first tip and sometimes a lot of steps after it if you can take a step back maybe you can change some of those boxes before the maybe you can remove them altogether to make that better take thermostats for instance you now so you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time now that seemed great every thermostat had started adding that feature but it turned out that no one saved any energy now why is that well people couldn 't predict the future they just didn 't know how their weeks would change season to season year to year so no thermostat designers went back to the drawing board and they focused on that programming step they made better u i s they made better documentation but still years later people were not saving any energy algorithm in instead of the programming people are saving energy without any programming so it doesn 't matter what you 're doing if you take a step back and look at all the boxes maybe there 's a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make that process much simpler so that 's my first tip look broader for my second tip it 's to look closer one of my greatest teachers was my grandfather he taught me all about the world the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project the list went on and on so what because there 's so many different wall types and we came up with three different screws to put in the box but it turned out it we went back to the drawing board just instantly after we figured out we didn 't get it right and we designed a special screw a custom screw much to the chagrin of our investors they were like why are you spending so much time on a little screw get out there and sell more more if we get this right and it turned out we did with that custom little screw there was just one screw in the box that was easy to mount and put on the wall the ones we may not see and we look at maybe there 's a way to get rid of those so my last piece of advice is to think younger every day i 'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids they come up with questions like why can 't cars fly around traffic those questions are smart my son came to me the other day and i asked him go run out to the mailbox and check it he looked at me puzzled and said why doesn 't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail sometimes we find out we just don 't have the right answers we say and sometimes they find a better way so my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team picasso once said every child is an artist is when he or she grows up is how to remain an artist we all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time before a lifetime of habits got in the way look and to think younger it 's not easy it requires us pushing back against one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world we could do some pretty amazing things for you that could mean something else something powerful our challenge is to wake up each day and say how can i experience the world better thank you very much"
