  "transcript": "trace the trinity across my chest my tiny body drooping like a question mark all over the wooden i asked jesus to fix me and when he did not answer i befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn and salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue but shame lingered as an aftertaste and in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity my mother told me of the miracle i was i could grow up to be anything i want i decided to be a boy played hide and seek with what was left of my goal i was it the winner to a game the other kids and when i turned twelve met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home that i exist i treat it like a house and when your house is falling you do not evacuate you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides you make it pretty enough to invite guests over you make the floorboards strong strong enough to stand on my mother fears i have named myself after fading things that i 'll turn into what a shame conversations bruce jenner on everyone 's lips while the brutality of living in this no one ever thinks of us as human that it ensnares them without their consent that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer can you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins to misspell their names on gravestones and people still wonder why there are boys rotting they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second afraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day and now is embracing more transgender children than parents i wonder how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant like my blood is not the wine that washed over jesus ' feet my prayers are now getting stuck maybe i just don 't care maybe god finally listened to my prayers"
