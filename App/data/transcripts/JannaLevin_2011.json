  "transcript": "most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes the sun burns our peripheral vision we see light reflected off the moon and with all of our modern telescopes i 'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack it can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold now we 'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe a sonic composition and we really should we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have because black holes can bang on space time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song which i 'd like to play for you some of our predictions for what that song will be we can see them indirectly because black but they won 't come to us directly through light we might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very and yet black holes may be heard even if they 're not seen now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein to whom we owe so much einstein realized that if space were empty if the universe were it would be like this picture except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it but if we were freely falling through the space even without this helpful grid we might be able to paint it ourselves because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines undeflected straight paths through the universe it would curve space and a freely what einstein did not realize was that if you took our sun and you crushed it down to an object so dense it wasn 't einstein who realized this it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i joined the german army already an accomplished scientist working on the russian front i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire and he was reading einstein 's recently published general theory of relativity and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary curves so strong that space would rain down into them space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole and even light could not escape this current light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be and all that would be left would be a shadow you will see the war has been kind to me enough despite the heavy gunfire i 've been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas and einstein was very impressed with his exact solution and i should hope also the dedication of the scientist and he took schwarzschild 's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity he did not believe they existed in nature he thought nature would protect us from their formation it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects in fact they 're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it 's actually not massive enough but if we did a little thought experiment as einstein was very fond of doing we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers and putting a tiny little earth around it in orbit maybe thirty kilometers outside of of the because now the sun 's gone we have no other source of light so let 's make our little earth self illuminated and you would realize you could put the earth in a happy orbit even thirty km outside of this but basically so we move this earth very close thirty kilometers outside and we notice it 's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole there 's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe but you actually have to get very close to fall in we can always see the earth it cannot hide behind the black if this were battlestar galactica and you 're fighting the cylons don 't hide behind the black hole now our sun will not collapse to a black hole it 's not massive enough but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy and if one were to eclipse the milky way this is what it would look like we would see shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes and if we were to fall towards this black hole light can escape but even though the black hole is dark from the outside it 's not dark on the inside because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us and even though due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us right before we were crushed to death by the black hole it would be like a near death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel but it 's a total death experience but black holes can be heard even if they 're not seen maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two they can be spinning hundreds of times a second at the end of their lives they 're going around each other very near the speed of light so they 're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction and as they do so they not only curve space but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space an actual wave on space time space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe and they travel out and if you can see and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning quiet black hole at the end of the day now of course your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully so you might have trouble understanding what 's going on but i 'd like to play for you the sound that we predict this is from my group a slightly less glamorous the sound you 're hearing is the light black hole banging and eventually we 're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy now i 've never heard it that loud it 's actually more dramatic at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic it 's sort of like ding ding ding this is another sound from my group no i 'm not showing you any images because black holes don 't leave behind helpful trails of ink and space is not painted showing you the curves but if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this you want to get moving and then they 're going to merge now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging that it chirps up at the end now and surely the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years or a million years at the speed of light to get to us but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear there are very industrious experiments being built on earth one called ligo which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an over four kilometers it 's a remarkably ambitious experiment and it 's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years to pick this up there 's also a mission proposed which hopefully will launch in the next ten years called lisa and lisa will be able to see black holes black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun in this hubble image we see two and they will merge over a billion year time scale it 's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration but lisa could see the final and it 's not just black holes but it 's also any big disturbance in the universe and the biggest of them all is the big bang when that expression was coined it was derisive like oh who would believe in a big bang but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang we don 't ever want to do that actually we want to be inside the universe because there 's no such thing as standing outside the universe so imagine you 're inside the big bang it 's everywhere it 's all around you and the space fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us galaxies form and generations of stars form in those galaxies and around one star at least one star and here we are frantically building these experiments doing these calculations writing these computer codes imagine a billion years ago two it gets closer and closer forty thousand whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity we 'll build them we 'll turn on the machines and bang we 'll catch it if it was the big bang we were going to pick up it would sound like this it 's literally the definition of noise it 's white noise it 's such a chaotic ringing but it 's around us everywhere presumably if it hasn 't been wiped out by some other process in the universe and if we pick it up it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation of our observable universe so within the next few years we 'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit render but if we detect those earliest moments it most elusive questions if we we can ask questions at least for this last minute that honestly but we have to ask is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history or is it possible that we 're just a branch off of a multiverse each branch with its own big bang in its past maybe some of them with black holes playing drums maybe some without maybe some with sentient life and maybe some without not in our past not in our future but somehow fundamentally connected to us here 's my are there other creatures in the multiverse wondering about us and wondering about their own origins and if they are i can imagine them trying to detect that faintest sound thank you"
