  "transcript": "and it 's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some fifty years ago when humans first stepped off but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets all eight of them and we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft the body formerly known as a planet and all of these robotic missions are part a voyage to understand something and we living on it came to be and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this there 's saturn and we have been to saturn before we visited saturn in the early 1980s but our investigations of saturn have become far more in depth in detail since and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established the saturn system is a rich planetary system it offers mystery just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral and then here 's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool galaxy taken by the hubble space telescope so the journey back to saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor and also and it pains me that i can 't tell you all that we have learned with cassini can 't show you all the beautiful pictures that we 've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply don 't have the time so i 'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn and have been for the past two and a half years saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the u s most of the beautiful show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with dione and those are titan and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar it and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it 's completely global and enveloping titan and that 's why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with cassini over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the titan or oil or what we didn 't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane and so it 's a condensable in the atmosphere and so recognizing this circumstance ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some three hundred and fifty degrees below zero fahrenheit but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth it carves gullies it forms it can create canyons it can pool in large basins and craters it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it 's dark it 's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner laughter that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can tell you that what we have found on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like the cassini people it has been like a jules verne adventure come true backlit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop and yet another moon there i don 't even know which one it is 's a very extensive atmosphere we have and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that 's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying we couldn 't make out what we were seeing when you look closer at meaning it 's a very young surface like a until six months after we got into orbit an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini 's investigation of titan and that was the deployment european built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system and it landed on the surface and i just want to it is so significant and and the celebratory presentations were given it was a moving demonstration of what the words united nations are supposed to mean a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it so it was i mean i 'm getting goose goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional it 's something that i will personally never forget and you shouldn 't either but anyway the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i can 't tell you what it was like and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it an unambiguous and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at sixteen kilometers okay now sixteen kilometers eight kilometers this is roughly an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the u s you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and here is the horizon ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it didn 't sink out of sight so it wasn 't fluid that we landed in what this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane and it 's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no these are dunes that are one hundred meters tall this is the saharan desert or you wouldn 't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no and then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found a during at least this season are apparently at the poles of titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a but yet strangely earth like and having earth like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and and so now we go onto enceladus enceladus is a small moon it 's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat and enceladus is very white it 's very bright and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole and we 're looking at the south pole here where we found this system of fractures and they 're a different color because they 're a different composition they are coated these fractures are coated with organic materials the south polar region has elevated temperatures it 's the hottest place on the planet on the body that 's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took we see we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in other words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i don 't think i need to tell you in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its thirteen point seven billion year history it is still so far the only home we 've ever 1960s and ok you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo eight astronauts in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight it was the first time that earth was imaged from space and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet well we on cassini have taken an equivalent and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings backlit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring but as if that weren 't brilliant enough cradled in the arms of saturn 's rings"
