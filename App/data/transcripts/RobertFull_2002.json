  "transcript": "if i could have the first slide please contrary to calculations made by some engineers bees can fly dolphins can swim and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces now what i want to do in the short time i have is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature 's i get to do this all the time and it 's just incredible i want to try to share just a little bit of that with you the challenge of looking at nature 's designs and i 'll tell you the way that we perceive it and the way we 've used it and if we could figure that out how can we implement so the answer is bio mimicry just copy nature directly we know from working on animals that the truth is that 's exactly what you don 't want to do and the constraints in building any organism when you look at it are really severe natural technologies have incredible constraints think about it if you were an engineer and i told you but it had to start off to be this big then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way or think about the fact that if you build an automobile i 'll tell you that you also inside it have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile because of history and the inherited plan start with a clean slate so organisms have this important evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer and this is really important when you begin to look at animals instead we believe you need to be inspired by biology this is a real challenge to do this because animals when you start to really look inside them how they work they have way too many motions for their joints and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine we believed and we hypothesized that one way animals could work simply is if the control of their movements tended to be built into their bodies themselves what we discovered was that they all work like this kangaroo well a human one of your legs or four legs as one of a trotting crab almost every organism we 've looked at this way be an article coming out that says that really big things like t rex probably couldn 't do this but you 'll see that next week now what 's interesting is the animals then we said bounce along the vertical plane this way and in our collaborations with pixar in a bug 's life and they asked us this question they say why model just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane when you 're telling us these animals are moving in the horizontal plane nobody in biology ever modeled it this way we took their advice and we modeled the animals moving in the horizontal plane as well we took their three legs collapsed them down as one we got some of the best mathematicians in the world from princeton to work on this problem and we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down but they 're also bouncing side to side at the same time and many organisms fit this kind of pattern now why is this important to have this model because it 's very interesting when you take this model and you perturb it you give it a push as it bumps into let 's look at the mathematics that 's enough laughter the animals when you look i would argue that human technologies are really different from natural technologies so far think about the typical kind of robot that you see human technologies have tended to be large whereas nature tends to be small and has many muscles and many many sensors different design however what 's changing what 's really exciting and i 'll show you some of that next is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics of nature then nature really can become a much more useful teacher and and they developed this new technique called shape it 's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like it just bends by itself beautifully so you can put those properties it inspired them to show off this design by producing a little robot they named sprawl our work has also inspired another robot a biologically inspired bouncing robot from the university of michigan and mcgill let 's go to the video and let me show you some of these animals moving and then some of the simple robots that have been inspired by our discoveries here 's what we do this is an american cockroach you think you don 't have in your kitchen and you can see that in this ghost crab from the beaches of panama and north carolina and you 'll see it 's bouncing here now what good are springy legs then what can they do well we wanted to see if they allowed the animals to have greater stability and maneuverability so we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we 're looking at we were certain they couldn 't do this and here 's what they did the animal ran over it and it didn 't even slow down you could it has six legs there are the tuned it moves in a gait that an insect uses and here it is going on the treadmill it can 't feel anything it doesn 't have it 's this technique of building this is what he 's doing to his thesis project very robust if a graduate student does that to his thesis project this is from mcgill and university of michigan this is the rhex six motors but it has springy tuned it moves in the gait of the insect it has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front and the hind leg on the other side sort of an here 's rhex it 's just working with a tuned mechanical and they said that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice and life ultimately on mars nothing can do that and i talk next i showed them this video with the simple design of rhex here and just to convince them we should go to mars in two thousand and eleven i tinted the video orange just to give them the sense another reason why animals have extraordinary performance and can go anywhere is because they have an effective interaction with the environment the animal i 'm going to show you that we studied to look at this is the gecko we have one here it 's holding on now i 'm going to challenge you i 'm going show you a video which one 's which they how many think the one on the left is running up the wall applause the point is it 's really hard to tell it 's just phenomenal they have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out it 's bizarre this peeling inspired irobot that we work with to build here 's a legged version and a tractor version or a bulldozer version here 's the gecko running up a vertical surface there it goes in real time there it goes again obviously we have to slow this down a little bit you can 't use regular cameras you have to take one thousand pictures per second to see this and here 's some video at one thousand frames per second now i want you to look at the animal 's back do you see how much it 's bending like that we can 't figure that out that 's an unsolved mystery we don 't know how it works if you have a son or a daughter that here 's the gecko mill so we can watch the animal 's feet and videotape them through the treadmill belt here 's the animal that we have pick a foot and try to watch a toe and see if you can see what the animal 's doing it can do this in fourteen milliseconds peeling in the it doesn 't use pressure sensitive glue the animal does not use that and if you blow that up and zoom in nine hundred times you see there are hairs there tiny hairs you 'll see each hair has split ends they have these little structures on the end the smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae and an animal like that has one billion of these in fact there 's the diameter of your hair a gecko has two million of these and each hair has one hundred to one thousand split ends think of the contact of that that 's possible we were fortunate to work with another group at stanford that built us a special manned sensor that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair here 's an individual hair with a little split how do they do it we 've recently discovered this do they do it by friction no force is too low do they do it by electrostatics no how about suction and they even stick under water just fine if you put their foot under water they grab on how do they do it then believe it or not they grab on by intermolecular by van der waals forces you know you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry where you had these two atoms they 're close together and the electrons are moving around that tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it 's added up so many times with these small structures what we 're doing is we 're taking that inspiration of the hairs and with another colleague at berkeley we 're manufacturing them and just recently we 've made a breakthrough where we now believe going to be able to create the first synthetic dry adhesive many companies are interested in this we also presented to nike even excited about this that we realized that that small size scale and where everything gets sticky and gravity doesn 't matter anymore we needed to look at ants and their feet because one of my other colleagues at berkeley but the ants do and we 'll figure out why so that ultimately we 'll make this move and imagine you 're going to be able to have swarms of these six millimeter robots available to run around where 's this going i think you can see it already clearly the internet is already having eyes and ears you have web cams and so forth but it 's going to also have legs and hands you 're going to be able to do programmable work through these kinds of robots so that you can we saw david kelly is at the beginning of that with his if nature 's not enough if you care about search and rescue or mine clearance or medicine or the various things we 're working on we must preserve nature 's designs otherwise these secrets will be lost forever thank you"
