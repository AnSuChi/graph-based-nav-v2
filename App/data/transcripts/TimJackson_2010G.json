  "transcript": "i want to talk to you today about prosperity about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity and not just us but the two billion people worldwide who are still and hope actually is at the heart of this in fact the latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity the irony is though that we have prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth and we 've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope spilling oil into the gulf of mexico changing the climate and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades and recession of we can 't live with it we can 't live without it trash the system or crash the planet it 's a tough choice it isn 't much of a choice and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and and efficiency and doing things but i think we should also just check the numbers take a reality check here so i want you to imagine a world in two thousand and fifty and i want to ask the and i want to ask the question how far and how fast would be have to move how clever would we have to be how much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets and here in my chart on the left hand side is where we are now this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment it 's around about seven hundred and seventy grams of carbon in the it 's a 130 fold improvement and that is ten times further and faster than anything we that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics it 's a bit complex and i apologize for that what i 'll try and do is i 'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms so it looks a little bit like this and that 's even better because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services that 's called the circular flow of the economy it looks harmless enough i just want to highlight one key feature of this system which is the role of investment now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies but it plays an absolutely vital role and what it does essentially is to stimulate further it does this in a couple of ways chasing productivity which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff but i want to concentrate on joseph schumpeter called this the process of it 's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty continually chasing expanding consumer markets consumer goods new consumer goods and this we love new stuff new material stuff for sure but also new ideas new adventures new experiences but the materiality matters too because in every society that anthropologists have looked at material stuff operates as a kind of language a language of goods a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories stories for example about how important we are conspicuous consumption we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic and this engine is not just economic value it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system adam smith two hundred years ago spoke about well you still need the shirt but you need the hybrid car the hdtv two holidays a year in the sun the netbook and ipad the list goes on an almost inexhaustible supply of goods driven by this anxiety and even if we don 't want them we need to buy them because if we don 't buy them the system crashes and to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades we 've expanded the money supply expanded credit and debt so that people can keep buying stuff and of course that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis but this i just want to show you some data here this is what it looks like essentially this credit and debt system just for the u k this was the last fifteen years before the crash and you can see there consumer debt rose dramatically it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis personal savings absolutely plummeted the savings ratio net savings were below zero in the middle of two thousand and eight just before the crash this is people expanding debt drawing down their savings just to stay in the game it 's a story about us people being persuaded to spend money we don 't have on things we don 't need to create impressions that won 't last on people we don 't care before we consign ourselves to despair maybe we should just go back and say did we get this right is this really how people are is this really how economies behave and almost straightaway what do people want to do they want to hunker down they want to look to the future they want to spend less and save more but saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view keynes called this the paradox of thrift saving slows down recovery and politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt to draw down our own savings even further just so that we can get the show back on the road so we can keep this economy going it 's an anomaly it 's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people here 's another one completely different one why is it that we don 't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change very very simple things like buying energy efficient appliances putting in efficient lights turning the lights off occasionally insulating our homes these things save carbon they save energy they save us money so is it it that though they make perfect economic sense we don 't do them well i had my own personal insight into this and it was just after actually to be honest and i had finally got around to doing some draft stripping installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts when she turned to me very solemnly and said will this really keep out the giraffes here they are the giraffes you can hear the mind working these ones interestingly are four hundred miles north of here outside in cumbria goodness knows what they make of the lake district weather but actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me because it suddenly became clear to me why we don 't do the blindingly obvious things we 're too busy keeping out the giraffes putting the kids on the bus in the morning getting ourselves to work on time surviving email overload and shop floor politics foraging for groceries throwing together meals escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime time tv or or ted online getting from one end of the day to the other keeping out the giraffes laughter what is the objective what is the objective of the consumer mary douglas asked in an essay on poverty written thirty five years ago it is she said to help create the social world and find a credible place in it that is a and it 's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model so who are we who are these people are we these novelty seeking hedonistic selfish individuals or might we actually occasionally be well psychology actually says there is a tension a tension between self regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors and these tensions but other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings and perhaps even more interesting from our point of view another tension between tradition or conservation novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups we 're looking at a map of the human heart and it reveals to us the crux of the matter what we 've done is we 've created economies encourage one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others in fact about curtailing curtailing possibilities it is about opening up it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect what does all this mean for economics what would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche well it might look a little bit like the four thousand community interest companies that have sprung up in the u k over the last five years and a similar rise in b corporations in the united states enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at in fact like this one ecosia and i just want to very quickly show you this ecosia is an internet search engine internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search and ecosia works so we can do that here we can just put in a little search term there you go oxford that 's where we are see what comes the difference with ecosia though is that in ecosia 's case it draws the revenues but it allocates eighty percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the amazon and we 're going to do it we 're just going to click on case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession that 's the page to go to and what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to ecosia and ecosia is giving eighty percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project it 's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources it 's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy it 's a form if you like of ecological altruism do in fact is to put investment back into the heart of the model to re conceive investment only now investment isn 't going to be about investment has to be a different beast investment has to be it has to be about transition it has to be investing in low carbon technologies and infrastructures we have to invest in fact and of this task has material dimensions it would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they didn 't have food clothing and shelter but it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this it has social and psychological aims friendship commitments society participating in the life of that society and this too requires libraries museums quiet centers places of joy and celebration places of tranquility and contemplation sites for the cultivation of a common citizenship in michael sandel 's lovely phrase an investment investment after all is just such a basic economic concept is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future and we need that relationship to reflect to reclaim hope so let me come back with this sense of hope to the two billion people still trying to live each day on what can we offer those people it 's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty it 's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations and it 's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we 're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity so this is not just a western in fact an african philosopher wrote to me when prosperity without growth was published pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional african concept of ubuntu ubuntu says i am because we are prosperity is a shared endeavor its roots are long and deep its foundations i 've tried to show exist already inside each of us so this is not about standing in the way of development it 's not about what we 're doing here and at the heart of that economics we 're placing a more credible more robust and more realistic vision of what it means to be to be inspiring so you may need to work on the tone a little can you picture the politicians ever buying into this i mean can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying and a country 's more beautiful and our lives are better tim jackson well that 's clearly not what you 're doing you 're not making news out of things falling down you 're making news out of the things that tell you that we 're flourishing can i picture politicians doing it actually and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves and actually in the period through which we 've been working over the last eighteen years partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world ca but is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together or is it going to be more just just civil society and companies it has to be civil society but it has to have political leadership this is a kind of agenda which but actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing different kinds of politics and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently absolutely vital ca and if someone could convince you that we actually can make the what was 130 fold improvement in efficiency of reduction of carbon footprint would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge based goods tj i would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water if you can convince me we can do all that then yes i would take the two percent ca tim thank you for a very important talk thank you"
