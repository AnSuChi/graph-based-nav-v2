  "transcript": "maybe even a sister or brainwashed a terrorist or just an airport security line delay that one 's actually true if some of your perceptions were negative i don 't really blame you that 's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me i guess people don 't talk to their uber drivers it 's great to meet you i 'm an introvert i decided to come out no and decided to start wearing the hijab my head covering my feminist friends were aghast why are you oppressing yourself the funny thing was it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure i felt as a to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty i didn 't just passively accept i wrestled with the quran i read and reflected and questioned and doubted it was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading i see myself in it i feel that god knows me have you ever felt like someone sees you completely understands you and like all good egyptians started my career as an engineer i later had a child after getting married and i was living essentially the and then that terrible morning of september two thousand and one i think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning i was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast and i look up on the screen and see the words breaking news what was this an accident malfunction my shock quickly turned to outrage who would do this and i switch the channel and i hear that same day we had to drive across middle america to move to a new city to start grad school crouched as low as i could go in my seat for the first time in my life afraid for anyone to know i was a muslim we moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world and then i was hearing and and again the warnings were don 't go that first friday it could be a target and i was also hearing about attacks on muslims something didn 't feel guess what so was i it 's the accusations that are tough today we hear people actually saying things like there 's a problem in this country and it 's called muslims when are we going to get rid of them so some people want to ban muslims and close down mosques they talk about my community kind of like we 're a tumor in the body of america and the only question is are we malignant or benign you know a malignant tumor you extract and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance the choices don 't make sense because it 's the wrong question muslims like all other americans aren 't a tumor in the body of america but it will not end terrorism going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement and as one police chief in the washington dc area recently told me people don 't actually get radicalized at mosques they get radicalized in their basement or bedroom in front of a computer and what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they so if we want to prevent radicalization we have to keep people going to the mosque now some will still argue islam is a violent but we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of one point six billion isis has as much to do with islam as the ku klux klan has to do with christianity but when you look at them they 're not motivated it 's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture and i was i was really surprised and asked him had she been in contact with a radical religious leader and he said the problem was quite the opposite and so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution what this imam did was to connect her back to god and to her community he didn 't shame her for her rage rage instead he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world what she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join isis but how does it impact ordinary americans how does it impact everyone well one study actually several studies in neuroscience show that when we 're afraid at least three things happen one study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories they became more accepting of military attacks on muslim countries now this isn 't just academic when you look at when anti muslim sentiment spiked but it wasn 't around so islamophobia isn 't just the natural response to muslim terrorism as i would would have expected eroding the very foundation muslims are like canaries in the coal mine we might be the first to feel it but the toxic air of fear is harming us all and assigning collective guilt isn 't just about having to explain yourself all the time deah and his wife yusor were a young married couple living in chapel hill north carolina where they both went to school talented promising and his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest most generous human being she she was visiting him there and he showed her his resume and she was amazed she said when did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man murdered them as well as yusor 's sister execution style after posting anti muslim statements on his facebook page so bigotry isn 't just immoral it can even be lethal so back to my story what happened after nine eleven did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay and it might seem like a small decision but to us it was about what kind of america we wanted to leave for our kids one that would control us by fear or one where we were so we decided to go to the mosque and we put my son in his car seat buckled him in and we drove silently intensely to the mosque i took him out i took off my shoes i walked into the prayer hall and what i saw made me stop and then the imam made an announcement thanking and welcoming our guests because half the congregation atheists people of faith and but to stand in solidarity with us i just break down at this time these people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice what will you choose what will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry will you play it safe or will you join those who say we are better than that thank you you work at a fancy think tank you 're an exception you 're not the rule what would you say to those people i would say don 't let this stage distract you i 'm completely ordinary i 'm not an exception my story is not unusual i am as as ordinary as they come when you look at muslims around the world and i 've done this i 've done the largest study ever done on muslims around the world people want ordinary things they want prosperity for their family they want oftentimes it 's that the rule is broken not that they 're an exception"
