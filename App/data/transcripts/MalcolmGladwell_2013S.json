  "transcript": "so i wanted to tell a story that that really obsessed me when i was writing my new book and it 's a story of something that happened three thousand years ago when the kingdom of israel was in its it takes place in an area called the shephelah and the reason the story obsessed me is that i thought i understood it and then i went back over it and i realized that i didn 't understand it at all ancient palestine had a there 's a mountain range still same is true of israel today and in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region and then there 's a coastal plain along the mediterranean where tel aviv is now which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west and you can follow the shephelah go through the shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains and the shephelah if you 've been to israel you 'll know it 's just about the most beautiful part of israel it 's gorgeous with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards it 's served it 's had a a real strategic function and that is it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains and three thousand years ago that 's exactly what the philistines who are the the biggest of enemies of the kingdom of israel are living in the coastal plain they 're originally from crete they 're a seafaring people and they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the shephelah up into the mountains because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by bethlehem and split the kingdom of israel in two and the kingdom of israel is headed by king saul obviously catches wind of this and saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the philistines in the valley of elah and and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other because they 're deadlocked so finally to break the deadlock the philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor and he calls out and he says to the israelites send your mightiest warrior down and we 'll it was a way of settling disputes without he 's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor and he 's got a sword and he 's got a javelin and he 's got his spear he is absolutely terrifying and he 's so terrifying and he goes up to saul and he says i 'll fight him and saul says you can 't fight him that 's ridiculous you 're this kid this is this mighty 't understand i have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years i think i can do it so he says all right and the shepherd says meaning i 've never worn armor before you 've got to be crazy so he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd 's bag and the giant sees this figure approaching and calls out come to me so i can feed your flesh to the to the birds of the heavens and the and the beasts of the field and the shepherd draws closer and closer and he says he 's insulted am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes right here in his most vulnerable spot and he falls down and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head and the philistines see this and they turn and they just run and of course the name of the giant is goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is david and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that so david in that story is supposed to be the underdog right in fact that term david and goliath has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone well we call him an underdog because he 's a kid a and goliath is this big strong giant we also call him an underdog because but most importantly we call him an and all david has is this sling well let 's start there with the phrase all david has is this sling because that 's the first mistake that we make men on horseback and which are foot soldiers armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor slingers and a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it and they inside the pouch and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target it 's in fact an and that means that it 's going forward really fast probably thirty five meters per second that 's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest more than that the stones in the valley of elah were not normal rocks they were barium sulphate which are rocks twice the density of normal stones if you do the calculations on the ballistics on the stopping power of the rock fired from david 's sling it 's roughly equal to the stopping power of a historical records that slingers experienced slingers could hit and maim or or even kill a target at distances of up to two hundred yards from medieval tapestries we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight they were incredibly accurate when david lines up and he 's not two hundred yards away from goliath he 's quite close to goliath he lines up and fires that thing at goliath if you go back over the history of ancient warfare you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle and his expectation when he challenges the israelites to a duel is that he 's going to be fighting another heavy he says come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field the key phrase is come to me come up to me because we 're going to fight hand to hand like this saul has the same expectation david says i want to fight goliath and saul tries to give him his armor because saul is thinking oh when you say ' fight goliath ' you mean ' fight him in hand to hand combat ' infantry on infantry he 's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and so here he is this shepherd experienced in the use of a devastating weapon up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short range combat and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable there 's a second piece of this that 's important it 's not just that we it 's also that we profoundly misunderstand goliath goliath is not what he seems to be there 's all kinds of hints of this in the biblical text so to begin with the bible says that now that right here is this mighty warrior challenging the israelites to one on one why is he being led by the hand by some secondly the bible story makes special note of how slowly goliath moves and then there 's this whole weird thing about how long it takes goliath to react to the to the sight of david so there is nothing about him that says i am about to fight you like this he 's not even carrying a sword why does goliath not react to that it 's as if he 's oblivious and then there 's that strange comment he makes to david am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks sticks david only has one stick well it turns out that there 's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with goliath an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies been many articles written the first one was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty in the indiana and usually when someone is that there 's an explanation for it so the most common form of giantism and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone so the tallest person of all time was a guy named robert wadlow he had acromegaly do you remember the wrestler andr the giant famous anyone who 's unusually tall that 's the first explanation we come up with and acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it principally having to do with vision the pituitary often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day because he can 't make his way on his own because he can 't see him come to me that i might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field the phrase come to me is a hint and then there 's am i a dog that you should come to me with sticks he sees two sticks when david has only one so the israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe and sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket"
