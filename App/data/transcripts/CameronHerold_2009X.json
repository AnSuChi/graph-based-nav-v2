  "transcript": "be willing to bet that i 'm the dumbest guy in the room but what i knew at a very early age was that i loved money and i loved business and i loved this entrepreneurial thing and what i 've been really passionate about ever since and i 've never spoken about this ever until now so this is the first time anyone 's ever heard it except my wife three days ago because she said what are you talking about and i told her is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing it 's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified which is what happens in a lot of society kids when we grow up and we have passions and we have visions and somehow we get those things crushed we get told that we need to study harder or be more focused or get a tutor and i still suck in french and it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world when i was in grade two i but nobody had ever said hey this kid 's a good speaker he can 't focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized no one said get him a coach in speaking they said get me a tutor in what i suck at so as kids unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say lawyer or let 's be a doctor and we 're missing that opportunity because no one ever says hey be an entrepreneur entrepreneurs are people because we have a lot of them in this room who have these ideas and these passions or see these needs in the world and we decide to stand up and do it and we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen we have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of every problem that 's out there somebody has the idea for and as a young kid nobody can say it can 't happen because you 're too dumb to realize that you couldn 't figure it out i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish the old parable if you a man a fish you feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime if we can teach our kids to become entrepreneurial the ones that show those traits to be like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science what if we saw the ones who had entrepreneurial traits and taught them to be entrepreneurs we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs you know and the school system teaches them to go after things like being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist and a teacher and a pilot and the media says that it 's really cool if we could go out and crosby our mba programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs the reason that i avoided an mba program other than the fact that i couldn 't get into any because i had a sixty one percent average out of high school and then sixty one percent average at the only school in canada that accepted me carlton it 's these random few people even in popular literature the only book i 've ever found and this should be on all of your reading lists the only book i 've ever found that makes the entrepreneur into the hero is atlas shrugged everything else in the world tends to look at entrepreneurs and we all decided to start these things because it 's really the only place we fit we didn 't fit in the normal work we couldn 't work for somebody else because we 're too stubborn and we have all these other traits but kids could be entrepreneurs as well i 'm a big part of a couple organizations globally called the entrepreneurs ' organization and the young presidents ' organization i just came back from speaking in barcelona at the ypo global conference and everyone that i met over there 's an entrepreneur struggled with school i have eighteen out of the nineteen signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed so this thing right here is freaking me out it attention deficit disorder ted turner 's got it steve jobs has it all three of the founders of netscape had it i could go on and on kids you can see these signs in kids and what we 're doing is we 're giving them ritalin and saying don 't be an entrepreneurial type fit into this other system and try to become a student sorry entrepreneurs aren 't students we fast track we figure out the game i stole i cheated on exams i hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for thirteen consecutive assignments but as an entrepreneur you don 't do accounting you hire accountants so i just figured that out earlier at least i can admit i cheated in university most of you won and i told the person who wrote the textbook i 'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook in every canadian and college studies in managerial accounting i 'm chapter eight i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting and i told the author after they did my interview that i cheated in that same course and she thought it was too funny to not include it anyway but kids you can see these signs in them the definition of an entrepreneur is a person who organizes operates and assumes the risk of a business venture and we 've heard those things about is it nurture or is it nature well i don 't think it 's either i think it can be both i had no choice because i was taught at a very early young age when my dad realized i wasn 't going to fit into everything else that was being taught to me in school that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age he groomed us the three of us to hate the thought of having a job and to love the fact of creating companies that we could employ other people my first little business venture i was seven years old i was in winnipeg and i was lying in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords and i was calling all the dry cleaners in winnipeg to find out how much would the dry cleaners pay me for coat hangers and my mom came into the room and she said where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners and i opened up this cupboard there was about a thousand coat hangers that i 'd collected because when i told her i was going out to play with the kids so and so i 'll just go get them and i knew she wouldn 't want me to go get them so i just did it anyway and people would pay that because it multiplied up at seven years old i figured it out i got three and a half cents i sold license plate protectors door to door my dad actually made me go find someone who would sell me these things at wholesale and at nine years old i walked around in the city of sudbury selling license plate protectors door to door to houses and i remember this one but i was convinced i was going to get him to buy a license plate protector and he 's like well we don 't need one and i said but you 've got two cars i 'm nine years old i 'm like but you have two cars and they don 't have license plate protectors and he said i know and i said this car here 's got one license plate that 's all crumpled up and he said yes that 's my wife 's car and i said why don 't we just test one on the front of your wife 's car and see if it lasts longer so i knew there were two cars with two license plates when i was about ten years old i sold comic books out of but it was obvious to me right buy low sell high you 've got this demand over here that has money don 't try to sell to the poor kids they don 't have cash the rich people do go get some so that 's obvious right it 's like a recession so there 's a recession there 's still thirteen trillion dollars circulating in the u s economy go get some of that i was forced to get a paper route at really want a paper route but at ten my dad said that 's going to be your next business which i did and then i realized that collecting tips was where you made all the money so i would collect the tips by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop he had all these old automotive parts lying around they had this old brass and copper i asked him what he did with it and he said he just throws it out i said but wouldn 't somebody pay you for and i was actually collecting it from all the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle and then my dad would drive me on saturdays to a scrap metal recycler and you made these pincushions out of wooden clothespins when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside and you 'd make these these chairs and i had these little pillows that i would sew up and you could stuff pins in them because people used to sew and they needed a pin cushion but what i realized was that you had to have options so i actually spray painted a whole bunch of them brown and then when i went to the door it wasn 't do you want to buy one it was which color would you like so i learned that lesson at a young age i learned that manual labor really sucks right like cutting lawns but because i had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors and get paid to do that i realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing that if i land this client once and every week i get paid by that person that 's way better than trying to sell one i would caddy i would go to the golf course and and caddy for people i realized that there was this one hill on our golf course the 13th hole that had this huge hill and people could never get their bags up it so i would sit there with a lawn chair and just carry up all the people who didn 't have caddies i would carry their golf bags up to the top and they 'd pay me a dollar meanwhile my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy 's bag around and get paid ten bucks i 'm like that 's stupid because you have to work for five hours that doesn 't make any sense you just figure out a way to make more money faster you just needed to have a supply and demand and this this audience who bought into you these women weren 't going to go to anybody else because they liked me and i kind of figured it out looking in the bush and looking in the ditches for golf balls i 'm like screw that they 're all in the pond and nobody 's going you get the golf balls and you just throw them in your bathing suit trunks and when you 're done but the problem is that people all didn 't want all the golf balls so i just packaged them i 'm like twelve right i packaged them up three ways i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then those sold for two dollars each and then i had all the good ones that didn 't look crappy they were fifty cents each and then i 'd sell fifty at a time of all the crappy ones and they could use those for practice balls i sold sunglasses when i was in school then when the school shut me down the school actually called me into the office and told me i couldn 't do it went to the gas stations and i sold lots of them then i paid my entire way through first year university at carlton yeah but you know what you stuff that down your shorts when you go into a football game you can get booze in for free everybody bought them supply demand big opportunity i also branded it so i sold them for five times the normal cost it had our our university logo on it you know we teach our kids and we buy them games but why don 't we get them games if they 're entrepreneurial kids that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs why don 't you teach them i remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in banff alberta because i 'd thrown a penny out in the street and my dad said allowances by nature are teaching kids to think about a job that 's wrong for if you want to raise entrepreneurs what i do with my kids now i 've got two nine and seven is i teach them to walk around the house and the yard looking for stuff that needs to get done come to me and tell me what it is or i 'll come to them and say here you breed that kind of stuff fifty percent goes in their toy account anything in their toy account they can spend on whatever they want the every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker both my nine and seven year olds have a stock broker already those habits to young kids when they don 't even feel the pain yet maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories why don 't you sit down with kids and give them four items a kangaroo and a laptop and have them tell a story about those four things my kids do that all the time it teaches them to sell it teaches show the kids what bad customers or bad employees look like show them the grumpy employees when you see grumpy customer service point that out to them say by the way that guy 's a crappy employee and say these ones are good ones if you go into a restaurant and you have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like we have all these lessons in front of us but we don 't take those opportunities we teach kids to go get a tutor ' junk that 's in the house right now all the toys that they 've outgrown two years ago and said why don 't we start selling some of this on craigslist and kijiji and they can actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when they get email offers come in they can come into your account or a sub account or whatever but teach them how to fix the price pull up the photos teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money then the money they get fifty percent goes in their house account fifty percent goes in their toy account my kids love this stuff attainment tenacity leadership introspection interdependence values all these traits you can find in young kids and you can look for that kind of stuff there 's two traits that i want you to also look out for that we don 't kind of get out of their system don 't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really really freaking bad the same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression unless it is so clinically brutal man bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease when steve jurvetson and jim clark and jim barksdale have all got it and they built netscape imagine if they were given ritalin we wouldn 't have have that stuff right al gore really would have had to invented the internet these skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom as well as everything else i 'm not saying don 't because there 's huge opportunities in that i want to close with a quick little video it it 's about kids hopefully this inspires you to take what you 've heard from me and do something with it to change the world the the"
