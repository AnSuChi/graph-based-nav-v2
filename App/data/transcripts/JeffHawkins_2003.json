  "transcript": "i do two things i design mobile computers and i study brains today 's talk is about brains and yay i have a brain fan out there if i could have my first slide why it is important that we should develop one and what we can do about it i we study theoretical neuroscience and how the neocortex works i 'm going starting from the very original laptop to some of the first tablet and we 're continuing to do this i 've done this because i believe mobile computing is the future of personal computing and i 'm trying to make the world a little bit better by working on these things very early in my career i decided i was not going to be in the computer industry before that i just have to tell you about this picture of graffiti i picked off the i was looking for a picture for graffiti that 'll text input language i found a website dedicated to teachers who want to and they had added graffiti to it and i 'm sorry about that when i was young and got out of engineering school at cornell in i went to work for intel and was in the computer industry and three months into that i said i made the wrong career choice here and i fell in love with brains and i don 't remember i have one recollection which was pretty strong in my mind they talked about the neuron development disease vision and all the things you might want to know about brains it was really quite impressive one might 've had the impression we knew a lot about brains but the last article in that issue was written by francis crick of this is all well and good this is a quote from that that article he says what is conspicuously lacking he 's a very proper british gentleman what is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches i thought the word we are in the pre paradigm days if you want to use thomas kuhn so i fell in love with this i said look we have all this knowledge about brains first i went to mit the ai lab was there i said i want to build intelligent machines too but i want to study how brains work first and they said oh you don 't need to do that you 're just going to program computers that 's all i said you really ought to study brains they said no you 're wrong i said no you 're wrong and i didn 't get in laughter i was a little disappointed pretty young but i went back again a few years later this time in california and i went to berkeley and i said i 'll go in from the biological you can 't do that so i said oh my gosh i was depressed i said but i can make a difference in this field i went back in the computer industry and said i 'll have to work here for a while that 's when i designed all those computer products and i would mature a bit and maybe so why should we have a good brain theory well there 's lots of reasons people do science the most basic one is people like to know things we 're interesting and fascinating we have a new understanding of who we are and if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive technologies or businesses or whatever this is one too because when we understand how brains work we 'll be able to build intelligent machines that 's a good thing on the whole with tremendous benefits to society just like a fundamental technology so why don 't we have a good theory of brains people have been working on it for one hundred years like this is normal science normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists the theorist guy says i think this is what 's going on the experimentalist says you 're wrong it goes back and forth this works and it 's a real shame now why has this come about if you ask neuroscientists why is what good is more going to do maybe we 'll be lucky and discover some magic thing we need a good theory so complex it 'll take another fifty years i even think chris said something like this yesterday something like it 's one of the most complicated things in the universe that that 's always been the case so we can say my neocortex the part of the brain i 'm interested in has thirty billion cells but you know what it 's very that 's not the issue very zen like woo you know it sounds good but why i mean what 's the point it 's just a bunch of cells you understand your liver it 's got a lot of cells in it too i don 't think there 's anything to that and finally some people say i don 't feel like a bunch of cells i i can 't be just a bunch of cells well people used to believe there was a life force to be to be living and we now know that 's really not not true at all and there 's really no evidence other than that people just disbelieve that cells can do what they do so some people have fallen into the pit of strongly held but incorrect assumption there 's something we believe that just it 's obvious but it 's wrong now there 's a history of this in science and before i tell you what it is i 'll tell you about the history of it in science look at other scientific revolutions the solar system that 's copernicus darwin 's evolution and tectonic plates that 's wegener the best minds were stumped really really smart people we 're not smarter now than they were then it just turns out it 's really hard to think of things but once you 've thought of them it 's easy to understand daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework in kindergarten it 's not that hard here 's the apple here 's the orange the earth goes around that kind of stuff another thing is the answer was there all along but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing it was an intuitive strongly held belief that was wrong in the case of the we all know the earth isn 't moving do you feel like you 're moving a thousand miles an hour so it was intuitive and obvious now what about evolution evolution same thing we taught our kids the bible says god created all these species cats are cats dogs are dogs people are people plants are plants they don 't change noah put them on the ark in that order blah all the mountains and the continents are kind of floating around on top what is the intuitive but incorrect assumption the intuitive but obvious thing is somehow intelligence is defined by behavior we 're intelligent because of how we do things and how we behave intelligently and i 'm going to tell you that 's wrong engineers and scientists like to look at systems like this the ai people said the thing in the box is a programmable computer because it 's equivalent to a brain we 'll feed it some inputs and get it to do something have some behavior alan turing defined the turing test which essentially says we 'll something 's intelligent if it behaves identical to a human a behavioral metric of what intelligence is that has stuck in our minds for a long time we experience the world through a sequence of patterns and we 're making predictions all the time it 's an internal metric there 's an internal metric about us saying do we understand the world am i making predictions and so on but you 're not doing anything but you 're being intelligent you 're understanding what i 'm saying because you 're intelligent and you speak english you know the word at the end of this sentence the word came to you you make these predictions all the time what i 'm saying is the internal prediction is the prediction leads to intelligent behavior here 's how that happens let 's start with a non intelligent brain i 'll argue a non intelligent brain we 'll call it an old brain and the alligator has it has very it can attack it can but we don 't consider i 'm going to represent the neocortex by this box it 's a new layer on top of your brain it 's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head that got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn 't fit laughter literally it 's about the size of a table napkin and doesn 't fit so it 's wrinkly you do it 's your emotional brain it 's all those gut reactions you have on top of it we have this memory system called the neocortex and the memory system is sitting it 's sitting there saying i 'm going to memorize all the things going on where i 've been people i 've seen things i 've heard and so on and in the future when it sees something similar to that again and it 's this feeding back into the old brain that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions this is the most i know which way to go i 've been here before i can envision the future that 's what it 's doing this is true for all mammals in humans it got a lot worse humans actually developed the front of the neocortex called the the anterior part of the neocortex i don 't have time to explain but to understand how a brain works you have to understand how the first part of the mammalian neocortex works how it is we the next note pops into your head already you anticipate it when you go home tonight you 'll put your hand out reach for the doorknob notice it 's in the wrong spot and go whoa something happened it i can change a thousand things about your door and in the two seconds you take to open and as you go up to the door we your brain doesn 't do that your brain is making constant predictions all the time about what will happen in your environment as i put my hand on this table i expect to feel it stop when i walk every if i missed it by an eighth of an inch i 'll know something has changed you 're constantly making predictions about your environment i 'll this is a picture of a woman when we look at people our eyes saccade over two to three times a second we 're not aware of it but our eyes are always moving you 'd see a nose where an eye is supposed to be and go you have an expectation of what you 're going to see what is the next number in this sentence here 's three visions of an object what 's the fourth one that 's how we test it it 's all about prediction and the framework is a memory framework not a computational or behavior framework it 's a memory framework how do you store and recall these sequences of patterns it i 've found the best people to work with are physicists then they have to learn the anatomy and the physiology you have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms anyone who tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn 't tell you exactly how it 's working and how the wiring works not too distant future to tell you about it i 'm really really excited this is not going to take fifty years what will brain theory look like first of all it 's going to be about memory not like computer memory not at all like computer memory it 's very very different it 's also memory of sequences you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence a song must be heard and these sequences are auto associatively recalled so if i see something i hear something it reminds me of it and it plays back automatically it 's an automatic playback it must be testable and you must be able to build it if you don 't build it you don and it 's going to be different than people think no doubt that it 's going to happen in my mind first of all we 're going to build this stuff out of silicon the same techniques we use to build and we 'll attach these memories to sensors but the robotics part is the hardest part that 's old brain that 's really hard the new brain is easier than the old brain so first we 'll do things that don 't require a lot of robotics so you 're not going to see see things more like intelligent cars that really understand what traffic is what driving is and have learned that with the blinkers on for half a minute probably aren 't going to turn"
