  "transcript": "go on the ted website you can currently find there over a full week of tedtalk videos over one point three million words of transcripts millions of user ratings and that 's a huge amount of data could you reverse engineer a tedtalk could you create the ultimate tedtalk and could you create the worst possible tedtalk that they would still let you get away with to find this out i looked at three things i looked at the topic that you should choose i now with the topic there 's a whole range of topics you can choose but you should choose wisely because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk now to make this more concrete let 's look at the list of top ten words that statistically stick out in the most favorite tedtalks so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains that 's a go whereas if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen girls aircraft actually i would like to hear that talk but statistics say it 's not so good generalize this the most favorite tedtalks are those and the more technical materials and strangely enough men those are not good topics to talk about how should you deliver your talk so they 're going to hate me for revealing this because actually you should talk as long as they will let you because the i 'll give you three examples of all i must as a speaker provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you instead of saying what i can 't have secondly it 's imperative that you do not cite the new york times and finally it 's okay for the speaker that 's the good news to fake intellectual capacity if i don 't understand something i can just say now let 's go to the visuals the most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speakers you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average and now the most important thing color plays a very important role color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website i think i 'm not the first one who has done this analysis but i 'll leave this to your since and i call this tool the tedpad and the tedpad is a matrix of one hundred specifically selected highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own tedtalk you only have to make one decision and that is are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks about creativity human genius or are thank you very much"
