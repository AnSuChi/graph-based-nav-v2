  "transcript": "you want to be when you mowgli from the jungle book not that we could have afforded i drive i accompanied my little sister in complete innocence as i always had all my life because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters and my little sister wanted to be a pilot god help her so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun and he said so what are you going to do to celebrate and i took that driving lesson and i said i 'm going to learn how to drive and then there was a silence one of those awful silences and he said you haven 't told her yet as janis ian would best say i learned the truth at seventeen legally blind and you know how on earth did i get to seventeen and not know that well if anybody says country music isn 't powerful let me tell you this i got there because my father 's passion for johnny cash and a song a boy named sue i 'm the eldest of three i was born in so let me just tell you the great part of all of this i can 't see this clock and i can 't see the timing so holy god woohoo i 'm going to come up really close here don even you steve is george clooney strange part is that at three and a half just before i was going to school my parents made a bizarre unusual and incredibly brave decision no special needs schools no labels no limitations my ability and my potential and they decided to tell me that i could see so just like johnny cash 's sue a boy given a girl 's name but more significantly they gave me the ability to believe totally to believe that i could and so when i heard that eye specialist tell me and don 't get me wrong because when i first heard it aside from the fact that i thought he was insane i got that thump in my chest just that huh it was like that the first thing i thought about was my mom who was crying you 're mad i 'll drive i know i can drive i could never see the and i couldn 't see the destination but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldn 't see because i didn 't want and i didn 't want to be weak and i believed i could do it so i rammed through life and then i went to business school and you wonderfully my eyes decided enough and i 'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world where you work hard play hard you gotta be the best you gotta be the best and two years in i really could see very little and i found myself in front of an hr manager was twenty eight years old i had built a persona and i need help asking for help can be incredibly difficult and it 's frightening isn 't it operating in the sighted world when you can 't see it 's kind of difficult it really is can i tell you airports are a disaster oh and please any designers out there ok designers please put up your hands can 't even see the little sign for a gents ' toilet or a ladies ' toilet is determined by a triangle have vaseline in front of your eyes it 's and you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect i was so lost i had and he asked me several questions of which many were so hard not to be yourself and do you love what you do caroline and you know when you go to a global consulting firm they put a chip in your head and you 're like i love accenture i love accenture i love my job i love accenture i love accenture i love accenture i love my job i love accenture and he said do you love it i couldn 't even so choked up i just was so and then he said to me what did you want to be when you were little i wasn 't going to say to him well i wanted to race cars and motorbikes hardly appropriate at this moment in time he thought i was mad enough anyway and as i left his office he called me back and he said i think it 's time i think it 's time to stop fighting and do something different and that door closed and that silence just outside a doctor 's office that many of us know and i had no idea where i was going i had no idea but i did know the game was up and i went home and because the pain in my chest ached so much i thought i 'll go out for a run really not a very sensible thing to do and i went on a run that i know so well i know this run so well by the back of my hand i always run it perfectly fine i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have bash on my rock broken fallen over on this rock in the middle of march in two thousand typical irish weather on a wednesday gray snot tears because who am i going to be what am i going to be and i thought about my dad and i thought good god i 'm so not sue now and you know the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me what do you want to be what do you want to be what did you want to be when you were little do you love what you do do something different what do you want to be do something different it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart something different well how about mowgli from ' the jungle book ' you don 't get more different than that and i mean the moment the moment that hit me i swear to god it was like hoo you know something to believe in and nobody can tell me no yes you can say i can 't be an archeologist but you can 't tell me no i can 't be mowgli because guess what nobody 's ever done it before so i 'm going to go do it and it doesn and so i got off that rock and oh my god did i run home and i sprinted home and i didn 't fall and i and there was one of my favorite books of all time travels on my elephant by mark shand i don 't know if any of you know it and i grabbed this book off and i 'm sitting on the couch going i 'm going to be an elephant handler and i had no idea how i was going to be an elephant handler but i knew really me all the bits of me and you know what that trip that thousand kilometers it raised enough money for six thousand cataract eye operations six thousand people got to see because of that when i came home off that elephant do you know what the most amazing part was because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant because disability is like the elephant in the room but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible and i never thought about noes anymore i 'll be honest and what am i doing here because it 's really good to skip queues in the airport and i got my way here even though i present confident i was scared he said cars and motorbikes and and elephants that 's not freedom and i never needed eyes to see never i simply needed vision and belief and if you truly believe and i mean believe from the bottom of your heart you can make change happen and we need to make it disabled perfect normal whatever everyone of us must the limiting because we are not jam jars we are extraordinary different"
