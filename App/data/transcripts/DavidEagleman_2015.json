  "transcript": "and we are embedded in a very large cosmos and the fact is that we are not very good at understanding reality at either of those scales and that 's because our brains haven 't evolved to understand the world but it gets strange because even at that slice of reality that we call home we 're not seeing most of the action that 's going on so take the colors of our world this but we 're not seeing all the waves out there in fact what we see is less than a ten trillionth of what 's out there because you don 't come with the proper biological receptors now it 's not that these things are inherently snakes include some infrared in their reality and honeybees include ultraviolet in their view of the world because you don 't come equipped with the proper sensors now what this means is that and that goes against the common sense notion that our eyes and our ears and our fingertips are just picking up the objective reality that 's out there so in the blind and deaf world of the tick the important signals are temperature and butyric acid in the world of the black ghost knifefish its sensory world is is lavishly colored by electrical fields its reality is constructed out of air compression waves that 's the slice of their ecosystem that they can pick up on and we have a word for this in science which is the german word for the surrounding world every animal assumes that its umwelt because why would you ever stop to imagine that there 's something beyond what we can sense instead what we all do is we accept reality as it 's presented to us your whole world is about smelling you 've got a long snout that has two hundred million scent receptors in it and your nostrils even have slits so you can take big nosefuls of air everything is about smell for you you stop in your tracks with a revelation you look at your human owner and you think what is it like to have the pitiful impoverished nose of a human what is it like when you take a feeble little noseful of air how can you not know that there 's a cat one hundred yards away or that your neighbor was on this very spot six hours ago we 've never experienced that world of smell because we are firmly settled into our umwelt so we already know that we can marry our technology to our biology so the way this works is you take a microphone and you put an electrode strip directly into the inner ear and as recently as fifteen years ago there were a lot of scientists who thought these technologies wouldn 't work but the fact is that it works the brain figures out how to use the signals now how do we understand that well here 's the big secret your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness inside your skull and this is all it has to your subjective world where it gets the data from and it just takes in everything and figures and that i think frees up mother nature to and i use this name to emphasize that all these sensors that we know and love like our eyes and our ears and our fingertips these you find lots of peripheral devices so snakes have heat pits with which to detect infrared and the ghost knifefish has fingers on it with which it feels around and constructs a 3d model of the world instead with the principles of brain so what this means is this the lesson that surfaces but it 's not what we have to stick stick with and the brain just figures out what to do with it but the first paper demonstrating this was published in the journal nature in one thousand nine hundred and sixty nine so a scientist named paul and he put something in front of the camera and then you would feel that poked into your back with a grid of solenoids so if you wiggle a coffee cup in front of the camera you 're feeling that in your back and amazingly blind people got pretty good at being able to determine what was in front of the camera just by feeling it in the small of their back been many so as things move around and get closer and farther it sounds like bzz bzz bzz it sounds like a cacophony but after several weeks blind people start getting pretty good at understanding what 's in front of them just based on what they 're hearing doesn 't have to be through the ears this system uses an electrotactile grid on the forehead so whatever 's in front of the video feed you 're feeling it on your forehead why the forehead because you 're not using it for much else and the video feed gets turned into these little electrotactile signals and blind people get so good at using this that they can throw a ball into a basket or they can navigate complex obstacle courses they can come to see through their tongue now that sounds completely insane right but remember all vision ever is is electrochemical signals coursing around in your brain your brain doesn 't know where the signals come from it just figures out what to do with them so my interest in my lab is and here is what we wanted to do given the power and ubiquity of portable computing so here 's and then it 's getting mapped onto a vest that 's covered in vibratory motors just like the motors the sound is getting translated to a pattern of vibration on the vest so as i 'm speaking so we 've been testing this with deaf people now and it turns out that after just a little bit of time people can start so this is jonathan he 's and here he is on the fifth day so scott says a word jonathan feels it on the vest and he writes it on the board sn where de jonathan is able to translate this complicated pattern of vibrations into an understanding of what 's being said jonathan is not doing this consciously because the patterns is that after wearing this for about three months he will have a direct perceptual experience of hearing the meaning comes directly off the page without any conscious intervention at all now this technology has the potential to be a game changer because the only other solution for deafness is a cochlear implant and that requires an invasive surgery we 've been very encouraged by our results with sensory substitution but what we 've been thinking a lot about is sensory addition how could we use a technology like this to add a completely new kind of sense to expand the human so here 's an experiment we 're doing in the lab a subject is feeling a real time streaming feed from the net of data for five and he has to make a choice he doesn 't know what 's going on he makes a choice and he gets feedback after one second now here 's the thing the subject has no idea what all the and the feedback is telling him whether he did the right thing or not and what we 're seeing is can we expand the human umvelt so that he comes to have after several weeks a direct perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet so we 'll report on that later to see how well this goes we 've been automatically scraping twitter for the and we 've been doing an automated sentiment analysis which means are people using positive words or negative words or neutral i have been feeling this and so i am plugged in to the aggregate emotion of thousands of people and that 's a new kind of human experience because now i can know how everyone 's doing and how much you 're loving this it 's a bigger experience than a human can normally have so in this case the vest is streaming nine different measures from this quadcopter and that improves this pilot 's ability to fly it it 's essentially like he 's extending his skin and that 's just the beginning what we 're envisioning is taking a modern cockpit full of gauges in a world of information now and there is a difference between accessing big data and experiencing it so i think there 's really no end to the possibilities on the horizon for human expansion just imagine an astronaut being able to feel overall health of the international space station or or having vision or seeing in infrared or ultraviolet as we move into the future we 're going to increasingly be able to choose our own thank you first time i felt applause on the vest this could be the first experiment that secures its funding forevermore right if successful de well that 's right i wouldn 't have to write to nih anymore ca well i mean this is amazing but isn 't most of the evidence so far that that sensory substitution works not necessarily that sensory addition works i mean and that that is needed as part of it de that 's a great question we actually have no idea what the theoretical limits are of what kind of data the brain can take in the general story though is that it 's extraordinarily flexible so when a person goes blind what we used to call their visual cortex gets taken so what that tells us is that the cortex is kind of a one trick pony it just runs certain kinds of computations and when we look around at things like braille for example people are getting information through bumps on their fingers so there are so many possible applications for this are you ready for this what are you most excited about the direction it might go de i mean i think there 's a lot of applications here in terms of the things i started mentioning about astronauts on the space station they spend a lot of their time monitoring things and they could instead just get what 's going on because what this is really good for is multidimensional the key is this our visual systems are good at detecting blobs and edges but they 're really bad at what our world has become which is screens with lots and lots of data we have to crawl so this is a way of just feeling the state of something just like the way you know the state of your body as you 're standing around so i think heavy machinery safety feeling the state of a factory of your equipment that 's one place it 'll go right away"
