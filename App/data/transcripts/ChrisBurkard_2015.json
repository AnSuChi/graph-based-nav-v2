  "transcript": "so if i told you that this i wouldn 't blame you because every time i look at this i shiver just a little bit i want to tell you a little bit about this photograph i was swimming around in the lofoten islands in norway just inside the arctic circle and the water was hovering right at freezing the air feet and face and rush to protect my vital organs it was the coldest i 've ever been i have found that this place right here psychologist brock bastian probably said it best when he wrote it makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment it brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation if shivering is a form of meditation then i would consider myself a monk before we get into the why would anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water i would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can i surf photographer right i don 't even know if it 's a real job title to be honest my parents definitely didn 't think so when i told them at nineteen i was quitting my job to pursue this blue skies warm tropical beaches and a tan that lasts all year long i mean to me this was it life could not get any better but there was just this one problem you see the more time i spent traveling to these exotic locations the less gratifying it seemed to be i set out seeking adventure it was things like wi fi tv fine dining and a constant cellular connection and it didn 't take long for me to start feeling suffocated i began craving wild it 's that any career has the danger of becoming monotonous so in my search to break up this monotony i realized something there 's only about a third it was probably going to happen somewhere cold where the seas are notoriously rough and that 's exactly and it was my first trip to iceland that i felt like i found exactly what i was looking for i was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape most importantly i couldn 't believe we were finding perfect waves in such a remote and rugged part of the world at one point we got to the beach only to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline they created this barrier between us and the surf and we had to weave through this thing like a maze just to get out into the lineup and once we got there we were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves it was because amidst those harsh conditions i felt like i stumbled onto one of the last quiet places somewhere that i found a clarity and a connection with the world i knew i would never find on a crowded beach i was hooked cold water was constantly on my mind and from that point on my career focused and one of my favorite things about these places was simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there hours days weeks spent on google earth trying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to and once we got there the and a couple of super sketchy helicopter flights there was this one particularly bumpy boat ride up the coast of vancouver island to this kind of remote surf spot where we ended up watching helplessly from the water as bears ravaged our camp site they walked off with our food but to me that trip now it wasn 't until i traveled to norway so this is the place where some of the largest the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline we were in this tiny remote fjord just inside the arctic circle it had a greater population of sheep than people so help if we needed it was nowhere to be found and it started to snow and then the temperature and i told myself there 's not a chance you 're getting out of the water you traveled all this way and this is exactly what you 've been waiting for freezing cold conditions with perfect waves and although i couldn 't even feel my finger to push the trigger i knew i wasn 't getting out so i just did whatever i could i shook it off whatever but that was the point that i felt this wind gush through the valley and hit me and what started as this light snowfall and i started to lose perception and all i could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls now i knew this place had a reputation for was out there floating i started to get a little bit nervous and i don 't know if it was delirium setting in or what but they told me later i had a smile on my face the entire time now it was this trip and probably that exact experience where i really began to feel like every photograph was precious and i realized all this shivering had actually taught me something in life there are no shortcuts that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines see i gave a piece of myself and what i walked away with was a sense of fulfillment i had always been searching for it 's easy to see frozen fingers and but most of all what i see thank you so much"
