  "transcript": "it 's a mold with an identity crisis because it 's not a mold so let 's get that straight to start with it is one of seven hundred known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba all sharing a cell wall all operating as one entity in its natural habitat you might find the slime i first came across the slime mold about five years ago a microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it the only instructions i was given that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats i 'm an artist who 's worked for many years with biology with scientific processes so i took it home and i noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish it would escape and find a better home so it 's not really i could observe some really interesting behaviors the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously it knows it 's already there it recognizes it 's there and instead retreats back and grows in directions i was quite impressed by this feat at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime i found countless scientific studies research papers journal articles all citing incredible work with this one organism a few of those with you it retracted from empty areas and dead ends there are four possible routes through this time and time again the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence and each time the slime mold slowed down its growth however at the next interval the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn a third experiment the slime mold was invited to it fans out in a branching pattern as it goes each food node it finds it forms a network a connection to and keeps foraging now there 's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations the slime mold had replicated the tokyo transport network a complex system developed over time by community dwellings civil engineering urban planning what had taken us well over one hundred years took the slime mold just the conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem it is a biological computer algorithmically analyzed it 's been sonified replicated simulated world over teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics programming and robotics a video i shot and it 's about one hundred times magnification there is a rhythmic pulsing flow streaming first in one direction and then back in another synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment so it 's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism a democratic slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides self selecting people have found and it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and you name it it 's a very interesting eclectic membership another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion communication so people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon it 's also enabled me to conduct what i think is the world 's first human slime mold experiment this is part of an exhibition in rotterdam last year we invited people to become slime mold for half an hour essentially tied people together so they were a giant cell and invited them to follow slime mold rules you have to communicate through oscillations and the motivation for for moving and then exploring the environment is in search of food so a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow ropes wearing being slime mold t shirts wandered through the museum park when they met trees they had to reshape their connections and reform as as a mass cell through not speaking this is a ludicrous experiment in many many ways this isn and provide a playful platform for discussions about the things that one of the most exciting things about this experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards an entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park people talked about the human psychology of how difficult it was to let go of their individual other people talked about bacterial communication each person brought in their own individual especially when given beer we gave them beer as well it 's biologically fascinating it 's computationally interesting but it 's also a symbol a way of engaging with ideas of community collective behavior cooperation a lot of my work draws on the scientific research so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way and the slime mold is also my working material it 's a participatory events whilst the slime mold doesn 't choose to work with me exactly collaboration of sorts i can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates but i can 't control it the slime mold has the final say in the in the creative process these branching patterns that we see we see across all forms scales of nature from river deltas to lightning strikes from our own blood vessels to neural networks networks i give you"
