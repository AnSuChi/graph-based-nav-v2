  "transcript": "though many human intellectual and technological leaps had happened in europe and the rest of the world but africa was and that changed first with ships when we had the renaissance these revolutions have not been evenly distributed across continents and nations never have been this is a map of the undersea fiber optic cables that connect africa to the rest of the world what i find amazing is that africa is transcending its geography problem the connectivity situation has improved greatly but some barriers remain it is with this context that ushahidi came to be one of the problems that we faced was it was a very tragic time it was a very difficult time so we came together and we created software called ushahidi and ushahidi means testimony or witness in swahili i 'm very lucky to work with two amazing and put a map so that you could see what was happening where and you could visualize that data we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did and that 's why we set up the ihub in nairobi an actual physical space where we could and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem and a few years later it became very useful software and we were quite humbled when it was used in haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in japan and ushahidi turned five we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world there are crisis we are humbled that this has roots in kenya and that it has some use to people around the world trying to figure out the different issues that they 're dealing with there is more that we 're doing to explore this idea of collective intelligence that i as a citizen if i share the information with whatever device that i have could inform you about what is going on and that if you do the same we can have a bigger picture of what 's going on i moved back to kenya in two thousand and eleven erik moved in two thousand and ten very different reality i used to live in chicago where there was abundant internet access i had never had to deal with a blackout it 's a very different reality and one thing that remains despite the leaps in progress and the digital revolution is the electricity problem dealing with this can be let 's just say very annoying your internet connection goes down with it now where 's the modem how do i switch back and then guess what you have to deal with the other problem that we 're facing is that communication costs or nigeria and also when traveling within africa you 've got different settings for different mobile providers this is the reality that we deal with so we 've got a joke in ushahidi where we say if it works in africa and reduce the cost of connection could we leverage the cloud we 've built a crowd map we 've built ushahidi could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country so we looked at the modem an important part of the infrastructure of the internet and asked ourselves why the modems that we are using right now are built for a different context where you 've got ubiquitous internet you 've got ubiquitous electricity yet we sit here in nairobi and for our reality what if we could have connectivity with less friction it fails over and connects to the nearest gsm network mobile connectivity in africa is pervasive it 's actually the other reason that we built this is when it can be the primary means of connection the software sensibility at ushahidi is still at play when we wondered how can we use the cloud to be more intelligent so that you can analyze the different networks and whenever you switch on the backup you pick on the fastest network so we 'll have multi sim capability so that you can put multiple sims and if the up time on that is not very good then you hop onto the next one the idea here is for you to be able to connect anywhere with load balancing this can be possible the other interesting thing for us we like sensors on ramp for the internet of things imagine a weather station that can be attached to this it 's built in a modular way so that you can also attach a satellite module so that you could have internet connectivity even in very remote areas out of adversity can come innovation and it is not without challenge our team has basically been mules carrying components from the u s to kenya we 've had very not part of the ecosystem for supporting hardware projects so we put it on kickstarter and i 'm happy to say that through the support of many people not only here but online and now the the interesting part of bringing this to i will close by saying that if we solve this for the local market it could be impactful not only for the coders in nairobi but also for small business owners the idea is that the building blocks of the our part to keep africans connected and to help them drive the global digital revolution thank you"
