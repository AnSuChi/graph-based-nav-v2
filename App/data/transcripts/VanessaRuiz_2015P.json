  "transcript": "as a lover of human anatomy i 'm so excited that we 're finally putting our bodies at the center of focus patient empowerment and self monitoring down to now obsessing over every single step we take in a day despite all this focus on the healthy self general public knowledge of the anatomical self is lacking many people don 't know the location of their vital organs or even how they function and that 's because human anatomy is a difficult and subject to learn how many of you here made it through anatomy i like you spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures something no student of anatomy could do without the help whether you remember every little structure or not but what happens when we 're done studying these beautiful illustrations are then shut back into the pages of a medical textbook or an app referenced only when and for the public medical illustrations may only be encountered passively on the walls of a doctor 's office from the beginnings of modern medicine medical illustration and therefore anatomy have existed primarily within the realm yet there 's something fascinating happening right now artists are breaking anatomy out of the confines of the medical world and are thrusting it into the public space for the past nine years i have been cataloguing and sharing this rise in anatomical art with the public but before i get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today it 's important to understand how art influenced anatomy in the past now anatomy is by its very nature a visual science and the first anatomists to understand this lived during the renaissance they relied and this drive to not only teach but also to entertain resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations anatomy was caught in a struggle between science art and culture that lasted for over five hundred years artists rendered dissected cadavers they also showed them as very much dead unwillingly stripped of their skin disembodied limbs were often posed in literal still lives and some illustrations even included pop culture references this is clara a famous rhinoceros that was traveling europe in the including her in this illustration was akin to celebrity sponsorship today the introduction of color then brought a whole new depth and clarity to anatomy that made it stunning they created a universal representation of anatomy something that was neither alive nor dead that was free from those influences of artistic culture and this now we are innately tuned into the beauty of the human body and medical illustration is nothing can elicit an emotional response from joy to complete disgust more than the human body artists armed with that emotion are grasping anatomy from the medical world and are reinvigorating it through art in the most imaginative he takes 19th century anatomical illustrations of the male body and envelops them in a female sensuality thereby introducing a strong femininity that was previously lacking in the history of anatomical representation artistry can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body this is an x ray of a woman who fractured and dislocated her ankle in a roller skating accident montreal based architect federico carbajal to construct a wire wire sculpture of her damaged lower leg notice those bright red screws magnified in the sculpture these are the actual surgical screws used in reconstructing her ankle and for me it 's a balance between the technique and a concept that pushes the boundaries of anatomy as a way to know thyself which is why the work of michael reedy struck me his serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor for instance take a look at her face notice those red marks michael manifests the consuming insecurity of a skin condition as these maniacal cartoon monsters annoying and out of control in the background making it look like candy by doing this michael downplays the common perception of anatomy so closely tied to just disease and death now this next concept might not make much sense but human anatomy is no longer limited to humans when you were a child did you ever wish that your toys could come to life well jason freeny makes those dreams come true with his magical toy dissections but jason says of his dissections one thing i 've never seen in a child 's reaction to my work fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction this also extends to politically and socially charged objects in noah scalin 's anatomy of war we see a gun but if you look closely notice that it lacks a brain and if you keep looking you might also notice that noah has so thoughtfully placed the rectum watching him excite the public about anatomy danny quirk is a young artist who paints his subjects in the process and this creates a 3 d illusion that lends itself very well to painting directly on the human skin danny makes it look as if a person 's skin has actually been removed now danny is currently traveling the world teaching anatomy to the public via his body paintings but he 's doing just fine then there are artists who are extracting anatomy from both the medical world and the art world world and are placing it directly on the streets paints giant x rays of pop culture icons his x rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own and conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person you come to admire his work because reproducing x rays by hand but then again this is a street artist who also happens to hold a degree in applied chemistry splattering human and animal dissections on walls all over the world influenced by comics and heavy metal nychos inserts a very youthful and enticing energy into anatomy that i just love and this street anatomy is so captivating because it is the furthest removed from the medical world like i do that it elicits these responses at all is due to our intimate and often changing relationship with it but a base from which to understand the human body on a meaningful level to depict it in ways that we can relate whether it be through cartoons body painting or street art anatomical art has the power to reach far beyond the pages of a medical textbook ultimately connecting our innermost selves with our bodies thank you"
