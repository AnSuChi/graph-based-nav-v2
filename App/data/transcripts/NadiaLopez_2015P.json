  "transcript": "mott hall bridges academy in two thousand and ten my goal was simple open a school to close a prison now to this was an audacious goal because our school is located in the brownsville section of brooklyn like many urban schools with high poverty rates like finding teachers who can empathize with the complexities lack of funding for technology parental involvement and neighborhood gangs that recruit children as early as fourth grade so here i was the founding principal of a middle school that was a district public school and i only had thirty percent of them had special needs eighty six percent of them were below grade level in english and in math and one hundred percent were living below the poverty level and if they 're not learning where would they end up it was evident when i would ask my where do you see yourself in five years and his response i don 't know if i 'm gonna live that long or to have a young woman say to me that she had a lifelong goal of working in unacceptable it was also evident that they had no idea that there was a landscape of opportunity that existed beyond their neighborhood and the skills that they learn today will prepare them for college and career readiness i chose the royal colors scientists entrepreneurs and even leaders who can and will take over this world this is nearly two hundred children who are now going to some of the most competitive high schools it was a cold day in january when my scholar met brandon stanton the founder of the popular blog humans of new york brandon shared the story of a young man from brownsville who had witnessed violence firsthand yet he can still be influenced by a principal vidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children who are struggling to survive which is why we must make education a priority brandon 's post created a global sensation that touched the lives of millions this resulted in one point four million dollars being raised summer steam programs as well as college scholarships need to understand that when two hundred young people from brownsville visited harvard and the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them by a disadvantaged community were replaced by hope and purpose the revolution in education is happening in our schools with adults support these are the things that inspire children but it is not an easy task are high demands but i have a dynamic group of educators who collaborate as a team to determine what is the best curriculum and come in on weekends and even use their own money to often provide resources when we do not have it and as the principal so i show up in classes and i give them access to me every single including my scholars and those who graduated which is probably why i get phone calls and text messages at three o 'clock in the morning but we are all connected to succeed and good leaders do this and they are our responsibility that means everyone in here and those who are watching the and remind them by teaching them that there indeed is power in education"
