  "transcript": "i love video games above and i think and in particular i think we can learn things about learning now the video games industry is is far and away the fastest growing of all modern media from about ten and it shows no sign of of slowing down it 's estimated it 'll be worth over eighty billion dollars that 's about three times the recorded music industry but i don 't think it 's the most telling statistic of all the thing that really amazes me is that today people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist this is a screenshot from the virtual game world entropia universe earlier this year a virtual asteroid in it sold for three hundred and thirty and this is a and this virtual object takes two hundred real people about fifty six days of real time to build plus countless thousands of hours of effort before that and yet many of these get built at the farmville that you may well have heard of has this may all sound really quite alarming to some people an index of something worrying or wrong and the good news is that i think we can explore why this very real human effort this and i think the most interesting way to think about how all this is going on is in terms of rewards and specifically it 's in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively now if we look at what 's going on in someone 's head when they are being engaged two quite different processes are occurring on the one hand there 's the wanting processes this is a bit like ambition and drive i 'm going to do that i 'm going to work hard fun and affection and delight and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back it 's a really great image it 's pretty cool it 's from the game world of warcraft and it 's pretty awesome it gives you great powers it 's a very great pleasure to fly around and so these but this isn 't the really interesting stuff the really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it because what you can measure in virtuality is everything every single thing that every single person who 's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured the biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players about what everybody does far more detail than you 'd ever get from any website and this allows something very special to happen in games it 's and by this i mean looking at what millions upon millions of people have done and carefully calibrating the the nature the type the intensity of rewards in games to keep them engaged over staggering amounts of time and effort now to try and explain this in sort of real terms i let 's say for the sake of argument my mission is to get fifteen pies and i can get fifteen pies by killing these cute little monsters simple game quest i don 't know what 's inside them until i open them and i go around opening box after box until i 've got fifteen pies now if you can think about it if you like as a great getting better and better stuff in them this sounds immensely boring but games are able to make this process incredibly compelling and the way they do this is through a combination of probability and data nor too difficult you look at a million people no one hundred million people one hundred million box openers and you work out if you make the pie rate about twenty five percent i could make a game called piecraft where all you had to do was get a million pies or a thousand pies there 's something in it some little reward that keeps people progressing and engaged in most and we say well how many monsters should i have the entire world full of a but we 're in virtuality these aren 't real boxes so we can do some rather amazing things that when people get to about thirteen out of fifteen pies their perception shifts they start to get a bit bored a bit testy they 're not rational about probability they think this game is unfair it 's not giving me my our games don 't always do this and one thing they certainly do at the moment is if you got a zero point one they make very sure another one doesn 't appear for a certain length of time to keep the value to keep it special and the point is really that we evolved to find certain things stimulating and as but now we can reverse engineer that and build worlds that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes i 've come up with seven things that i think show how you can take the first one is very simple it 's already been done at the university of indiana in the states among other places you give them one profile character avatar which is constantly progressing in tiny tiny tiny little increments which they feel are their own and everything comes towards that and they watch it creeping up and they they own that as it goes along multiple long and short term aims five thousand pies boring it 's about but another task is collaborating with other people another task is showing you 're working five times another task is you break things down into these calibrated slices that people can choose and do in parallel to keep them engaged and that you reward effort it 's your one hundred percent factor games are brilliant at this every time you do something you get credit you get a credit for trying you don 't punish failure you reward every little bit of effort a little bit of gold a little bit of credit you 've done twenty questions tick it all feeds in as minute reinforcement absolutely crucial and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this if you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today that we 've been hearing amazing things about it 's very very hard for people to learn if they cannot link consequences to actions but if you can model things for people if you can give things to people that they can manipulate and play with and the now this is the neurological because a known reward excites people but what what really gets them going is the uncertain reward the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty that they didn 't quite know whether they were going to get it or not the twenty five percent this and if you think about using this in testing in just introducing control elements of randomness in all forms of testing and training you can transform the levels of people 's engagement by tapping into this very powerful evolutionary mechanism quite predict something perfectly we get really excited about it we just want to go back and find out more and something very exciting is just just beginning to happen in places like the university of bristol in the u k where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically dopamine levels in the brain and what this means is we can predict learning we can predict enhanced engagement these windows these windows of time in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level the first has to do with memory when someone is more likely to remember we can give them a nugget in a window and harder to discourage this can all seem very sinister but you know sort of our brains have been manipulated we 're all addicts the word addiction is thrown around there are real concerns there but the biggest neurological turn on for people it 's not being given cash that 's nice it 's doing stuff with our peers watching us collaborating with us and i want to tell you a quick story about one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine a and in this video game there were two really big dragons and you had to team up to kill them forty two people up to forty two to kill these big dragons that 's a problem because they dropped two or three decent items so fairly and transparently what happened was they paid each other a virtual currency they called dragon kill points and every time you turned up to go on a mission you got paid in dragon kill points and then players could bid now the staggering system not just that this worked in everquest but that today a decade on every single video game in the world with this kind of task uses a version of this system tens of millions of people and the success rate is at close to one hundred percent this is in which these these principles could could fan out into the world let 's start with business i mean we 're beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business and i think yes we could take that so much further by allowing people to set targets by setting calibrated targets by using elements of uncertainty by using these multiple targets by using a grand underlying reward and incentive system by setting people up to collaborate in terms of groups in terms of streets to collaborate and compete to use these very sophisticated group and motivational mechanics we see we can use calculated randomness we can and we can use the among others is literally starting to pay people to lose weight so we 're seeing financial reward being used to tackle but again those rewards could be calibrated so precisely if we were able to use the vast expertise of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal to take the data to take the observations of millions of human hours and plow that feedback into increasing engagement and in the end it 's this word engagement that i want to leave you with but it 's also about collective engagement about the unprecedented laboratory for observing what makes people tick and work and play and engage then thank you very much"
