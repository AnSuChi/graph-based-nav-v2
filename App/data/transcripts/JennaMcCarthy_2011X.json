  "transcript": "make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together and not to have sex with anyone else else ever he buys a ring she buys a dress they go shopping for all sorts of things she takes him to arthur murray for ballroom dancing lessons and the big day comes and they 'll stand before god and family and some guy her dad once did business with and they 'll vow that nothing not abject poverty not life threatening illness not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion these optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative 50 pound weight gain until that when one of them is finally able to rest in peace you know because they can 't hear the snoring anymore showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time half of them will be divorced within a decade they 'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll and i mean look it doesn 't take a study to figure out what makes a marriage not too much time on facebook having sex with other people but you can have the exact opposite of all of those things respect excitement a broken internet connection what 's what can we learn from them why should you stop what you 're doing and make it your life 's work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out and it turns out the success stories share a few similarities beyond that they don 't have sex with other people for instance in the happiest marriages wife is thinner and better looking than the husband obvious right it 's obvious that this leads to marital bliss because women we care a great deal about being thin and good looking whereas men mostly care about sex ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are the beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy we just have to be thinner than our partners we just need to wait for them to get fat maybe bake a few pies this is good information to have and it 's not that complicated research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives for example the happy wife instead of pointing out her husband 's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run she might say thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire but it 's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars and it 's a good thing you 've got all that body fat to keep us warm because we needed a study to tell us this the more attractive she finds him the more sex they have the more sex they have the nicer he is to her the the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed and ultimately they live happily ever after men you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department here 's an interesting one one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce this is an actual study the researchers were not looking at documented self reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals the data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures i don 't know how old all of you are but when i was a kid your parents took they didn 't take three hundred shots of you in that rapid fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest smiliest one for the christmas card no they dressed you up they lined you up and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday i have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and i 'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce so what else can you do to safeguard your marriage do not win an oscar for best actress halle berry hilary swank sandra bullock and it 's not just successfully starring in films that 's dangerous it turns out merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet laughter apparently bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us but it obviously hasn 't and it probably never will makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we 've got it pretty good but here 's a scary one divorce is contagious that 's right when you have a close couple friend split up it increases your chances of getting a divorce by i have to say i don 't get this one at all my husband and i have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and viagra and eharmony and so now you may be wondering why does anyone the us federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone 's spouse a list that includes visitation rights in jail but hopefully you 'll never need that one but beyond the profound federal perks married people make more money we physically and emotionally we produce happier more stable and more successful kids we have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends believe it or not which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place i can 't tell you how to find of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn 't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce but i can only encourage you to try because the benefits as i 've pointed out are significant the bottom line is whether you 're in it or you 're searching for it i believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing so i hope you 'll use the information i 've given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors i 'd say i 'm doing ok so we have to keep an eye on that and we do like a cocktail or two on the other hand and also my husband does a lot around the house and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives so i 've got all those things going for me i plan to work extra hard to not win an oscar anytime soon and for the good of your relationships i would encourage you to do the same i 'll see you at the bar"
