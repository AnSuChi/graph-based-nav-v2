  "transcript": "we 've looked at our government oversight and yet at the same time this very well may be a seminal moment in american history an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america i 'm calling this the great unwind and the idea is a simple simple idea which is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety to action consumers who represent percent of the gdp of america have actually started just like banks and just like businesses to unwind their leverage in daily life to remove themselves from the liability and risk that presents itself as they move forward so to understand this and i 'm going to stress this it 's not about the consumer being in retreat the consumer is empowered to understand this we 'll step back and look at what so if you 've been gone this is the cliffsnotes on what 's happened in the economy and oil was one hundred and fifty dollars a barrel last summer and it 's somewhere between fifty and seventy do you plan vacations how do you buy what 's your strategy in your household currency valuations health care all these issues facing us you put them all together mix them up in a bouillabaisse and you have consumer confidence that 's basically a ticking time bomb this is something i call the 50 20 paradox it took us fifty years to reach annual savings ratings of almost ten percent fifty years do you know what this was right here was world war ii do you know why savings was so high we went from a ten percent savings rate to a negative we bought extra large cars supersized everything we bought remedies restless leg syndrome all these things together basically created a factor where the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis that we face today the personal ratio basically went from to one hundred and thirty five percent in the span of about fifteen years so consumers got over leveraged and of course our banks did as well as did our federal government this is an absolutely to two thousand and nine and what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon that we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging future education future children in our households so if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout what you can see is if you stack up dollar bills first of all three hundred and sixty thousand dollars is about the size of a five foot four but if you stack it up you see this amazing staggering amount of dollars that have been put into the system to fund and bail us out so this is the first three hundred and fifteen billion what we 're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate in fact eleven straight months of savings have happened since the beginning of the crisis we 're working our way back up to that ten percent visa now reports that more people are using debit cards than but that 's not really the whole story because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation and you 've got to admit over the last year and a half consumers have been doing some weird things it 's pretty pretty staggering what we 've lived through if you take into account that eighty percent of all americans were born after world war ii this was essentially our some crazy things have happened i 'll vasectomies guns and shark attacks dentists report molars people grinding their teeth coming in and reporting that they 've had stress so there 's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced vasectomies are up according to the cornell institute but a very good point hopefully not related to the former point i just made which is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from two thousand and three does anybody know why what we see happening and the reason i want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat is that this is a tremendous opportunity for the consumer who drove us into this recession to lead us right back out what i mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption to mindful consumption right if you think about the last three decades the consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the ' 90s to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in but the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate by restricting their demand consumers can actually align their values with their spending and drive capitalism and business to not just be about more but to be about better we 're going to explain that right now we set out to understand what 's been happening in the crisis with the consumer the first cultural value shift we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life this is the movement from americans defining their success on having things to having liquidity because the less excess that you have around you the more nimble and fleet of foot you are consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously makes you look a little bit anti fashion so let 's look at some examples of this dclass consumption that falls out of this value the first thing is something must be happening when p diddy vows to tone down his bling but seriously we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary but you 've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership we also see the trend toward tourism that 's a little bit more and then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents what businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets is really interesting a couple things that are kind of cool one is figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer they found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month another quick example of these types of movements the rise of zynga and lastly some people are using hulu as a device to get rid of their cable bill so really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of and that marketers are starting to understand the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play we see that play itself out with empathy and respect the consumer is demanding it so we see with empathy and respect lots of really hopeful things come out of this recession i 'll give you a few examples one is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods and increased emphasis on your neighbors we had this miracle on the hudson in and suddenly sully has become a key name on babycenter so from a value and values standpoint what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways microsoft is doing something wonderful they are actually vowing to retrain using their existing infrastructure to do something good complete transparency think twice before you have that bottle of wine we 're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon not a sprint they 're digging in and looking for ways to so what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge we also see a big diy movement i was fascinated to learn that thirty percent of all homes in america are actually built by owners that includes cottages and the like but thirty percent people are getting their hands dirty rolling up their sleeves they want these skills we see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens chickens and ducks and when you work out the math they say it doesn 't work but the principle is there it 's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself so what brands can do and companies is pay dividends to promise you 're going to be there beyond today 's sale perfect example of that is patagonia patagonia 's footprint chronicles basically for your student education so consumerism that we see is this movement about return to the fold it 's incredibly important right now trust is not parceled out as we all know it 's now about connecting to your communities connecting to your social networks in my book i talked about the fact that seventy two percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company versus fifteen percent on advertising wines and other products and then they did a recent report the people 's electricity usage in those communities dropped then we also look at the idea of cow pooling which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled well why not have a carrot so these are consumers organizing pooling their resources to incentify companies to do good organize it you need to harness it you need to give it meaning and there 's lots of really interesting examples here they have a lot because it 's their network so that becomes a very powerful force for them to make their brand more elastic then you look at the phenomenon of kogi this kogi doesn 't exist it 's a moving truck it 's a moving truck through l a and the only way you can find it is through twitter or you look at johnson & johnson 's momversations a phenomenal blog that 's been built up where j & j basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers allowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect and it 's also become a very very valuable advertising revenue for j & j as well allowing their employees to be part of the process rather than hidden behind walls you total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt all because the consumer is demanding it so when we look at this and step back what i believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real it 's been tremendously powerful for consumers but at the same time this is also a tremendous opportunity the chinese character for crisis is actually the same side of the same coin crisis equals opportunity what we 're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for it will drive innovation it will make longer lasting products it will create better more intuitive customer service and it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies that share the values that we share"
