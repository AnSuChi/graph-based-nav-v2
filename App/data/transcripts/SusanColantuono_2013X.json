  "transcript": "fifty percent of middle management and professional positions but the percentages of women at the top of organizations represent not even a third of so some people hear that statistic and they ask why do we have so few women leaders believe that leadership manifests at every level you would see that there 's a tremendous awesome resource of leaders who are leading in middle management which raises a different question why are there so many women mired in the middle so some of you might be some of those women who are in middle management and seeking to move up in your organization well tonya is a great example of one of these women i met her and she said to me with a sense of deep frustration i 've worked really hard to improve my confidence and my assertiveness and develop a great brand i get terrific performance evals from my boss my in the organization let me know that my teams love working for me and yet i 've been passed over twice for advancement even when my manager knows that i 'm committed to moving up and even interested in an international assignment i don 't understand why i 'm being passed over so what tonya doesn 't realize is that there 's a missing of the career success equation for women and it 's understanding what this missing thirty three percent is that 's required to close the gender gap at the top in order to move up in organizations you have to be known for your leadership skills and this would apply to any of you means that you have to be recognized for using the greatness in you put in other language it means you have to use your skills and talents and abilities to help the organization achieve its strategic financial goals and do that by working effectively with others inside of the organization and outside and although all three of these elements of leadership are important when it comes to moving up in organizations they aren 't equally important so pay attention to the green box as i move forward in seeking and identifying employees with high potential the potential to go to the top of organizations the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership these skills and competencies can be summarized as business and financial acumen in other words this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going what its strategy is this is that missing thirty three percent of the career success equation for women not because it 's missing in our capabilities or abilities but because it 's missing in the advice that we 're given here 's what i mean by that five years ago i was asked to moderate a panel of executives and the topic for the evening was what do you look for in high potential employees so think about the three elements of leadership as i summarize for you what they told me they said we look for people who are smart and hard working and committed and trustworthy and resilient so which element of leadership does that relate to personal greatness and are overall great communicators and what about people who are able to scan the external environment identify understand the story that the financials tell and either take appropriate action or make appropriate recommendations and to a man they said that 's a given turned to the audience of one hundred and fifty women and i asked how many of you have ever been told that the door opener for career advancement is your business strategic and financial acumen and that all the other important stuff is what differentiates you in the talent pool and the percentage is never much different but how can it be well there are primarily three reasons that there 's this missing thirty three percent in the career success advice given to women when organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we 've been hearing for over forty years much of the advice is emphasizing this doesn 't mean that this advice is unimportant what it means is that this is advice that 's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management and this is why conventional advice to women in forty years hasn 't closed the gender gap at the top and won 't close it now the second reason relates to tonya 's comments about having had excellent and having taken every management training program she can lay her hands on so you would think that she 's getting messages from her organization through the talent development systems and performance management systems that let her know how important it is to develop business strategic and financial acumen but here again that green square is quite small on average talent and performance management systems in the organizations that i 've worked with focus three to one on the other two elements of leadership compared to the importance of business strategic and financial which is why typical now and this is really important to talk about because if organizations talent and performance systems aren 't giving people in general information about the importance of business strategic and financial acumen how are men getting to the top so what 's women 's experience as it relates to mentoring well this he was very proud of the fact that last year he had two and he said i helped the woman build confidence and i didn 't realize that i was treating them any differently and he was sincere about that so what this illustrates is that as managers whether we 're women or men so how do we take this idea of the missing thirty three percent and turn it into action well for women the answer is obvious we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we 're people who understand our businesses and our role in taking it there that 's what enables that breakthrough from but you don 't have to be a middle manager to do this one young scientist that works in a biotech firm used her insight about the missing nor would it be wise to do so and here 's why in order for companies to achieve their strategic financial goals executives understand that they have to have everyone pulling in the same direction and so for sixty three percent of and if you think about what i 've just shared that you have situations where at least fifty percent of your middle managers haven 't received clear messaging that they have to become and their role in taking it there it 's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this it 's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions why because if they aren 't seeing that it could be a red that their organization isn 't as aligned as it could potentially be it 's important for ceos to also expect these proportional pools and if they hear comments like well she doesn 't have enough business experience ask the question what are we going to do about that and it 's important for women and men who are in management positions to examine so let me close with the latest chapter in tonya 's story and she said that she was so happy and i hope that for all of you you will see it as an idea worth spreading thank you"
