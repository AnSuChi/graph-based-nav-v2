  "transcript": "right now you have a movie playing it has 3d vision and surround sound for what you 're seeing and anger it has memories like scenes from your childhood playing before you voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking at the heart of this movie is you this movie is your stream of consciousness and the world we all have our own inner movie you and you and you there 's nothing we know about more directly at i can 't be certain that you guys are conscious consciousness also is what makes life worth living if we weren 't conscious nothing in our lives but at the same time it 's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe why are we conscious why do we have these inner movies why aren 't we just i 'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness into science some radical ideas may be some people say a science of consciousness is impossible science by its nature is objective and nobody even mentioned when ted got started there was very little scientific work all that began to change neuroscientists like francis crick and physicists like roger penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness and since then there 's been a real explosion a flowering of scientific work on consciousness and this work has been wonderful it 's been great the centerpiece of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for correlations between certain areas of the brain we saw some of this kind of work from nancy kanwisher and the wonderful work she presented now we understand much better for example the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain but this is still but we don 't know why they do i like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuroscience is answering some of the questions we want answered about consciousness questions about what certain brain areas do but it doesn 't address the real mystery at the core of this why is it that all that physical processing in a brain should be accompanied by consciousness at all why is there this inner subjective movie right now we don 't really have a bead on that and let 's just give neuroscience a few years it 'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon like traffic 'll figure it out the classical cases of emergence are all cases of emergent behavior how a hurricane functions how a living organism reproduces and adapts and metabolizes all questions about objective functioning you could apply that to the human brain in explaining some of the behaviors and the functions of the human brain as how we play chess all these questions about behavior but when it comes to consciousness questions about behavior when it comes to the hard problem that 's the question of why is it that all this behavior is accompanied by subjective experience and here the standard paradigm of i want a scientific theory of consciousness i banged my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in purely physical terms that would work but i eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn 't work for systematic reasons but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms in brain based terms is stories about the functioning of a system its structure its dynamics the behavior it produces how we function but when it comes to subjective experience why does all this feel like something so i think we 're at a kind of impasse here we 've got this wonderful of explanation we 're used to it where physics explains chemistry chemistry but consciousness doesn 't seem to fit into this picture on the one hand it 's a datum on the other hand we don 't know how to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world so i think consciousness right now is a kind of anomaly one that we need to integrate into our view of the world but we don 't yet see how faced with an anomaly like this radical ideas may be needed and i think that we may need one or two ideas that initially seem crazy before we can come to grips with consciousness scientifically now there are a few candidates for what those crazy ideas might be the whole idea of the inner subjective movie involves a kind of illusion or all we 've got to do is explain the objective functions the behaviors of the brain and then we 've explained everything that needs to be explained well i say more power to him that 's the kind of radical idea at the same time for me and for many other that view is a bit too close to simply denying the datum so i go in a different direction i want to explore two crazy ideas that i think may have some promise physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks space and time they postulate fundamental laws governing them like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics these fundamental properties and laws aren 't explained in terms of anything more basic and you build up the world from there now sometimes the list of fundamentals expands maxwell figured out that you can 't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals newton 's laws so he postulated fundamental laws of electromagnetism and postulated electric charge as a fundamental i think that 's the situation we 're in charge then as a matter of logic you need to expand the list the natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental this doesn 't mean you suddenly can the laws that connect physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a well i think something like that is the situation we 're in with consciousness we want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t shirt but that 's what we 're after the second crazy idea is that consciousness might be this view is sometimes called the idea is not that photons are intelligent or thinking i never get to slow down and smell the roses no not like that but the thought is maybe photons might have some element of raw subjective feeling some i mean why would anyone think such a crazy thing some motivation comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental if it 's fundamental like space and time and mass it it 's also worth noting that although the idea seems counterintuitive to us it 's much less counterintuitive to people from different cultures where the human mind is seen as much more continuous with nature a deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness to physical processing complex information processing simple information processing simple consciousness a really exciting thing is in recent years a neuroscientist giulio tononi has taken this kind of theory and developed it rigorously measuring the amount of information integrated high degree of phi a whole lot of consciousness but as you go down to but it 's still non zero on tononi 's theory there 's still going to be a non zero degree of consciousness in effect he 's proposing a fundamental law but it 's actually perhaps the leading theory and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t shirt physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract it describes the structure of reality using but it doesn 't tell us about the reality that underlies it as stephen hawking puts it well on the panpsychist view you can leave the equations of physics as they are but you can take them to be describing the flux of consciousness that 's what physics really is ultimately doing describing the flux of consciousness it 's there right at its heart panpsychist view has the potential to transfigure our and it may have some pretty serious social and ethical consequences some of these may be counterintuitive i used to think now so i think when you think about it this your views whereas what matters for ethical purposes and moral considerations not so much the fact it 's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems like computers what about the artificially intelligent system in the movie her samantha well if you take she certainly has complicated information processing if that 's right finally you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups does canada does an integrated group like the audience at a ted conference are we right now having a collective ted consciousness an inner movie for this collective ted group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts i don 't know the answer to that question but i think it 's at least one worth i 'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea that consciousness is fundamental than about the second one that it 's universal i mean the view raises any number of questions has any number of challenges like how do those little bits of consciousness add up if not well this is the hardest problem perhaps in science and philosophy we can 't expect to solve it overnight but i do think we 're going to figure it out eventually understanding consciousness is a real key i think both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves it may just take the right crazy idea"
