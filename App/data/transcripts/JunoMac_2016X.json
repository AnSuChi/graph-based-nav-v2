  "transcript": "i 'm not like most of the people you 'll have heard speaking about prostitution before i 'm not a police officer or a social worker i 'm not an academic a journalist or a i 'm not a nun either most of those people would tell you that selling sex is degrading in fact most of those people would say there should be a law against it maybe that sounds reasonable to you it sounded reasonable to me until the closing months of two thousand and nine when i was working i was exhausted and my life was going nowhere like many others before me i decided sex for money was a better option but it wasn 't going to happen anytime soon and my rent needed paying so i signed up for my first shift in a brothel in the years that have passed maybe you 've thought about them why prohibiting the sex industry actually exacerbates every harm that sex workers are vulnerable to then i 'm going tell you about what we as sex workers actually want the first approach is but if you 're forced to choose between obeying the law and feeding yourself or your family you 're going to do the work anyway and take the risk it 's hard to get a conventional job which is the exact opposite of its intended effect being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself in many places you may be coerced into paying a bribe or even into having sex with a police officer to avoid arrest electric shocks rape and denial of food south africa or new york a police officer can arrest you if you 're caught carrying condoms because condoms can legally be used imagine knowing if you 're busted carrying condoms it 'll be used against you it 's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home right what would you choose how about if you 're worried the police officer would rape you when he got you in the van the second approach to regulating sex work seen in these countries is partial criminalization where the buying and selling of sex are legal but surrounding activities like brothel keeping or soliciting on the street are banned laws like these we have them in the uk and in france essentially say to us sex workers just make sure it 's done behind closed doors and all alone but we 're also vulnerable if we choose to break the law by working together a couple of years ago a friend of mine was nervous after she was attacked at work so i said that she could see her clients from my place for a while during that time i told the guy to leave or i 'd call the police and he looked at the two of us and said you girls can 't call the cops you 're working together this place is illegal he was right he eventually left without getting physically violent but the knowledge that we were breaking the law empowered that man to threaten us he felt confident he 'd get away with it the prohibition of street prostitution also firstly to avoid getting arrested street workers take risks to avoid detection and that means working alone or in isolated locations like dark forests where they 're vulnerable to attack you pay a fine how do you pay that fine without going back to the streets it was the need for money that saw you in the streets in the first place and so the fines stack up and you 're caught in a vicious cycle let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge east london but during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested she was stabbed to death in the early hours twenty nine two thousand and thirteen she had been working later than usual to try to pay off a fine she had received for soliciting this is the aim of the third approach i want to talk about the swedish or nordic model of sex work law the idea behind this law is that selling sex is intrinsically harmful and so you 're in fact helping sex workers by removing the option despite growing support for what 's often described as the end demand approach there 's no evidence that it works there 's just as much prostitution in sweden as there was before why might that be it if you need that money the only effect that a drop in business is going have is to force you to lower your prices or offer more risky sexual services so you see rather than putting a stop to what 's often descried as pimping a law like this actually gives oxygen to potentially abusive third parties i try not to take bookings from someone who calls me from a withheld number if if i worked under the swedish model you need to protect your clients from the police less negotiating time means snap decisions is this guy dangerous or just nervous can you afford to take the risk can you afford not to something i 'm often hearing is prostitution would be fine if we made it legal and regulated it germany and nevada in the us great model for human rights and in state controlled prostitution commercial sex can only happen in certain legally designated areas or venues and sex workers are made to comply with special restrictions like registration and forced health checks but politicians deliberately make regulation around the sex industry expensive and difficult to comply with two tiered system brothel owners can comply with the regulations but more marginalized people find those hoops impossible to jump through the most vulnerable people are forced to work illegally so they 're still exposed to all the dangers of criminalization i mentioned earlier so fear of law enforcement makes them work alone in isolated locations and allows clients and even cops to get abusive in the knowledge they 'll get away with it crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks and into the arms of potentially abusive managers these laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start carrying out vigilante attacks against people working on the street in sweden opinion surveys show that significantly more people want sex workers to be now than before the law was brought in lgbtq people particularly trans women these are the groups most heavily profiled and punished through prohibitionist law i don 't think this is an accident these laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters don 't want to see or know about lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery can be saved by shutting a whole industry down so let 's talk about trafficking forced labor does occur especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable and this needs to be addressed but it 's best addressed with legislation targeting those specific abuses not an entire industry when twenty three undocumented chinese migrants drowned while picking cockles in morecambe bay in two thousand and four there were no calls to the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest the way the term trafficking coerce migrants into work they don 't want to do ultimately nobody wants to be forced to do any the problems arise from the criminalization of migration just as they do from the criminalization of sex work itself if you try to prohibit something that people want or need to do whether that 's drinking alcohol or crossing borders why else might people support prohibition as a feminist i know that the sex industry is a site of deeply entrenched social inequality and most sellers are women without you can agree with all that i do and still think prohibition is a terrible policy but you can 't simply legislate a better world taking away that option doesn 't make them any less poor or house them or change their immigration status people worry that selling sex is degrading ask yourself is it more degrading than going hungry or seeing your children go hungry there 's no call to ban rich people from hiring nannies or getting manicures even though most of the people doing that labor are poor migrant women it 's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable but we can 't make policy on the basis of mere feelings especially not over the heads of the people actually effected by those rather than about the underlying causes people get really hung up on the question well would you want your daughter doing it why isn 't she safer so we 've looked at full criminalization partial criminalization the swedish or nordic model and legalization and how they all cause harm something i never hear asked is what do sex workers want after all we 're the ones most affected by these laws new zealand decriminalized sex work in two thousand and three it 's crucial to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing decriminalization means the removal of laws that punitively target the sex industry instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work and employers of sex workers are accountable to the state a sex worker can refuse to see a client at any it was written in collaboration with sex workers namely the new zealand prostitutes ' collective when it came to making sex work safer they were ready to hear it straight from sex workers themselves here in the uk and we form part of a global movement demanding decriminalization and but we need more allies if you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health then sex worker rights matter to you make space for us in your movements that means not only listening to sex workers when we speak but amplifying our voices resist those who silence us those who say that a prostitute is either too victimized too damaged to know what 's best for herself or else too privileged and too removed from real hardship not representative of the millions of voiceless victims this distinction between victim and empowered is imaginary it exists purely to discredit sex workers and make it easy to ignore us well sex work is work too just like you some of us like our jobs but how we feel about our work and how others feel about our work certainly isn 't what 's important is that we have the right to work safely and on our own terms sex workers are real people we 've had complicated experiences complicated responses to those experiences but our demands you can speak to millions of sex workers we want full decriminalization and labor rights as workers i 'm just one sex worker on the stage today but i 'm bringing a message from all over the world"
