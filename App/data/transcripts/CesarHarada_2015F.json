  "transcript": "but you have to clean up after yourself but my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance i should say because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth and i teach and it doesn 't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash and if he is i did not give it to him and so it 's sad to say but today more than eighty percent of the oceans have plastic in them it 's a horrifying fact and in past decades we 've been taking those big ships out ages six to and so we started building and let me tell you kids with power tools are awesome and safe not really and and my job is to try to collect the best of each kid 's idea and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits we are going to collect only the data so we 're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot so robots kids get very excited and the next thing we do we do what we are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we 're hacking it and we hack table lamps and webcams into plumbing fixtures and we assemble that into a floating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there and the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called instructables in the hope that somebody would make it even better and boom they are trying to immediately address it and they came across this image this was a child probably under ten cleaning up an oil spill bare handed so they were very shocked because this is the water they drink this is the water they bathe in this is the water they fish in this is the place where they live so when everything is mixed up it 's really hard to see what 's in the water but there 's a technology that 's rather simple that 's called spectrometry so that help you identify so what was cool about this project was that beyond or looking at a local problem my students used their empathy and their sense of being creative to help i was very compelled by doing the second experiments and i wanted to take it even further maybe addressing an and maybe you remember in two thousand and eleven it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves they are called tsunami and those tsunami more than fourteen thousand people died in an instant also it damaged the nuclear power plant of fukushima the nuclear power plant just by the water and today i read the reports and an average of three hundred tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant and today the whole pacific ocean has traces of contamination of it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the japanese coast and most of it is now it looks like it 's safe it 's and i measure independently and with other scientists on land in the river so of course we didn 't take the kids the parents wouldn 't allow that it could look like they didn 't take the work seriously but and so what we did with them and talk about where we should be going next strategy itinerary etc and to do this we built a very rough topographical map of the region around the nuclear and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall but with this in mind we organized this we are sailing one point five kilometers away from the nuclear power plant we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we we 've invented and built we pack the sediment into small bags that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi you can see a progression here we 've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem and it 's been super exciting to work at these different scales with also very simple but at the same time it 's been increasingly frustrating and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to and so and chemistry a bit of biology a bit of optics basically you can build pretty much everything there ' dreams can come true with the help of adults and where adults can be kids again future of mobility with renewable energy for example or so plastic oil and radioactivity are horrible legacies but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies so makers dreamers we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people and that can actually do something about it"
