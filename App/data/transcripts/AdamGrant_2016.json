  "transcript": "seven years ago a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company he said i 'm working with three friends and we 're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online and i said ok you guys spent the whole we all took internships just in case it doesn 't work out all right but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate not exactly we 've all lined up backup jobs and there is still not a functioning website you guys realize the entire company is a website that 's literally all it is so i obviously declined to invest and they ended up naming the company parker why was i so wrong to find out i 've been studying people originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them they 're the people you want to bet on and they look nothing like i expected i want to show you today three things i 've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them so the first reason that i passed on i 'm a i just feel that a few months ahead of time i would wake up at 5am start playing and not stop until i had mastered them eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of since then i have traded hair for teeth and i was proud of that i had a student named jihae who came to me and said i have my most creative ideas when i 'm procrastinating and i was like that 's cute where are the four papers you owe me she goes into a bunch of companies she has people fill out she was like are our results you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they don 't have any new ideas and on the flip side the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don 't have original thoughts either there 's a sweet maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity to find out we asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are and some of them are asked to do the task right away others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling minesweeper in front of them the moderate procrastinators are sixteen percent more creative than the other two groups because if you play the game first before you learn about the task there 's no creativity boost it and then you start procrastinating but the task is still active in the back of your mind so just as we were finishing these experiments i was starting to write a book about originals and i thought this is the perfect time to teach myself to i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate laughter and then i worked diligently toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal i started writing the procrastination chapter and one day i but when i came back to it i had all sorts of new ideas i call it thinking take leonardo da vinci he but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light he was up past and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines eleven minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history i have a dream that was not in the script by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the he had freedom to improvise what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but they 're slow to finish and this is what i missed with when they were dragging their heels for six months i looked at them and said you know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online and it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth look at a classic study of over fifty product categories comparing the first movers who created the market with the improvers who introduced something different and better what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of forty seven percent compared with only eight percent for the improvers look at facebook waiting to build a social network until after myspace and friendster look at google waiting for years after altavista and yahoo 's much easier to improve on somebody else 's idea than it is to create something new from scratch so the lesson i learned is that to be original you don 't have to be first you just have to be different and better they were also full of doubts they had backup plans and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that originals would look something like this now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us laughter now in my research i discovered there are two different kinds of doubt there 's self doubt and idea but idea doubt is energizing it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like mlk did and so the key to being original is just a simple thing and i 'm just not there yet so how do you get there well there 's a clue it turns out in the internet browser that you use we can predict your job performance and your commitment just by now some of you are not going to like the results of this study but there is good evidence that firefox and chrome users significantly outperform internet explorer and safari users why it 's not a technical advantage the four browser groups on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge it 's about how you got the browser because if you use internet explorer or safari those came preinstalled on your computer and you accepted the default option that was handed to you and then be a little resourceful and download a so people hear about this study and they 're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser it 's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative to doubt the default and look for a better option you will open yourself up to the opposite of dj vu there 's a name for it it 's called vuja de laughter it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that can 't get the green light for more than half a century but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense she rewrites the first act reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever so there 's a simple message from this story when you feel doubt don 't let it go what about fear originals feel fear too they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all he was sure the first few spacex launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone but i have some good news for you you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion eighty five percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up take the guy who invented this do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb the greatest originals are the ones why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others the more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original beethoven mozart had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions if we want to be more original we have to generate more ideas they feel fear and doubt so when you see those things don 't make the same mistake i did don 't write them off and when that 's you don 't count yourself out either know that being quick to start but slow to finish can boost your creativity that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones it 's the best way to improve the world around us"
