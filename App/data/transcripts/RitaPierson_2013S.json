  "transcript": "i have spent my entire life or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse both my parents were educators my maternal grandparents were educators and for the past forty years i 've done the same thing and so needless to say over those years i 've had a chance to look at and we know why kids drop out we know why kids don 't learn it 's either poverty low attendance negative peer influences we know why but one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection george washington carver says all learning is understanding everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult for years i have watched people teach i have looked at the best and i 've looked at some of the worst a colleague said to me one time they don 't pay me to like the kids they pay me to teach a lesson the kids should learn it i should teach it they should learn it case closed i said to her you know kids don 't learn from people they don 't like people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship or you don 't i think stephen covey had the right idea he said you ought to just throw in a few simple things like seeking first to understand as opposed to being understood you ever thought about that tell a kid you 're sorry they 're in shock i taught a lesson once on ratios i 'm not real good with math but i was working on it and i got back and looked at that teacher edition i 'd taught the whole lesson wrong i need to apologize i taught the whole lesson wrong i 'm so sorry they said that 's okay you were so excited we just let you go i have had classes that were so low so academically deficient that i cried i wondered how am i going to take this group in nine months from where they are to where they need to be and it was difficult it was awfully hard how do i raise the self esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time one year i came up with a bright idea i told all my students you were chosen to be in my class because i am the best teacher and you are the best students they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it one of the students classes how to do it so when we walk down the hall people will notice us so you can 't make noise you just have to strut i have say it long enough it starts to be a part of you because you 're on a roll you got two right you didn 't miss them all for years i watched my mother take the time at recess to review go on home visits in the afternoon buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn 't smell so good see it 's hard to teach kids who stink and so she kept those things in her desk and i watched some of those same kids come through and say to her you know ms walker you made a difference in my life you made it work for me you made me feel like i was somebody when i knew the bottom i wasn 't and i want you to just see what i 've become and when my mama died two years ago at ninety two there were so many former students at her funeral it brought tears to my eyes not because she was gone but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear absolutely will you like all your children of course not and you know your toughest kids are never absent never you won 't like them all and the tough ones show up for a reason it 's the connection and we teach anyway how powerful would our world be if we had kids who who were not afraid to take risks and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be but it is not impossible we can do this we 're educators we 're born to make a difference thank you"
