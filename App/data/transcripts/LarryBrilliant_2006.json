  "transcript": "i got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world there 's nothing that makes you feel more the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that than to know that something that horrible so i 'm going to tell you so i 'm going to show you some dirty pictures they are because the horror of these pictures will be matched by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist my background is not exactly the conventional medical education that you might expect when i was an intern i heard about a group of native americans who had taken over alcatraz island and a native american who wanted to give birth on that island and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth i went out to alcatraz and i lived on the island for several weeks and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in indian affairs i wound up on every television show someone saw me on television they called me up and they asked me if i 'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called i was on the bus my wife of thirty seven years and i our bus ride took us from san francisco to london then we switched buses at the big pond we then got on two more buses and we drove through turkey and iran afghanistan over the khyber pass into pakistan like every other young doctor and then like everyone else in our generation we went to live in a himalayan monastery this is just like a residency program for those of you that are in medical school and we studied with a wise man a guru named karoli baba who then told me to get rid of the dress put on a three piece suit go join the united nations as a diplomat and work for the world health organization and he made an outrageous prediction and that prediction came and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world and this document is the certificate that the global commission signed certifying the world the key to eradicating smallpox was early detection i 'm going to ask you to repeat that early detection early response can you say that it killed five hundred million people you 're reading about larry page already somebody reads very fast in the year that larry page and sergey brin with whom i have a certain affection and a new affiliation we declared smallpox eradicated in one thousand nine hundred and eighty this is the most important slide that i 've ever seen in public health [ sovereigns killed by smallpox ] because it shows you to be the richest and the strongest and to be kings and queens of the world but to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign is the wrong perspective you should see it from the perspective of a mother watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly day one day two day three day seven they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication day eight and al gore said earlier that the most photographed image in the world the most printed image in the world was that of the earth but this was in one thousand nine hundred and seventy four and as of that moment this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed because we printed two billion copies of this photograph and we took them hand to hand door to door to show people and ask them we didn 't have computers by day nine you look at this picture and you 're horrified i look at this picture and i say thank god but you know this child has no other secondary infection and by day twenty while he will be scarred for life he will live there are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that this is confluent smallpox in which there isn 't a single place on the body where you could put a finger and not be covered which killed one hundred percent of people who got it and hemorrhagic smallpox the most cruel of all which had a they all had hemorrhagic smallpox i 've never seen anybody die from it who wasn 't a pregnant woman embarked on what was an outrageous program to eradicate a disease in that year there were thirty four countries affected with smallpox and india was the place where smallpox made its last stand in one thousand nine hundred and seventy four india had a population of six hundred million there are twenty one linguistic states in india which is like saying twenty one different countries twenty million people on the road at any time in buses and trains walking five hundred thousand villages one hundred and twenty million households and none of them wanted to report if they had a case of smallpox in their house because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity shitala mata the cooling mother and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house when the deity was in the that had smallpox deities smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world so how we eradicated smallpox it wouldn 't do just to vaccinate everyone you had to find every single case of smallpox in the world at the same time and draw a circle of immunity around it and that 's what we did in india alone my one hundred and fifty thousand best friends and i went door to door with that same picture i learned something very important every time we did a we had a spike we had the illusion that there was more disease a surveillance system was necessary because what we needed was and in one thousand nine hundred and it was the largest campaign in united nations history until the iraq war one hundred and fifty thousand people from all over the world doctors of every race religion culture and nation who fought side by side brothers and sisters but smallpox was the fourth disease but soon we may see polio eradicated but the key to eradicating polio and david heymann who 's we 're close we 're down to four countries i feel like hank aaron barry bonds can replace me any time let 's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about i was just in india working on the polio program the polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door that is the surveillance system but we need to have early detection the seva foundation was started by a group of alumni who having climbed the highest mountain tasted the elixir of seva 's programs in fifteen countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease steve jobs gave me that computer which is apple number and it 's still in kathmandu and it 's still working and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money and we conducted the first nepal survey ever done for health and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done and we had astonishing results instead of finding out what we thought was the case that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma we were astounded to find out that blindness was caused instead by cataract you can 't cure or prevent what you don 't know is there in your ted packages there 's a dvd infinite vision about dr v and the aravind eye hospital i hope that you will take a look at it aravind which started as a seva project is now the world 's largest and best eye hospital this year that one hospital will give back sight to more than three hundred thousand people in tamil nadu india bird flu i stand here as the key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and we will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years who stages the progress of a pandemic we are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage with just a little bit of this will not be like katrina the world as we know it will stop there 'll be no airplanes flying would you get in an airplane with two hundred and fifty people you didn 't know coughing and sneezing when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you for which you had no antivirals or vaccine i did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in october i asked them these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza and i asked them the questions you 'd like to ask them what do you think the likelihood is that there 'll be a pandemic if it happens how bad do you think it will be fifteen percent said ninety percent said they thought there 'd be a pandemic within your children or your grandchildren 's lifetime and they thought that if there was a pandemic a billion people would get sick as many as one hundred and sixty five million people would die just in time inventory system and the tight rubber band of globalization broke and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone because so many more people would lose their job and their healthcare benefits that the consequences are almost unthinkable let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like we know what we 're talking about let 's assume for example that the first case occurs in south asia it initially goes quite slowly you get two or three discrete locations then there 'll be secondary outbreaks and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won 't know what hit you within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world and we could go back and we could put each one of those viruses in jail that 's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic and let me show you why that is we have a joke this is an epidemic curve and everyone in medicine i think ultimately gets to know what it is but the joke is an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here and ride to glory on the downhill curve so we can stop but you can 't always do that but there 's an organization that has been able to find a way and that simulation that i showed you that you thought was bird flu that was sars and sars is the announced it and because of that we were able to stop the sars pandemic and i think we owe a great debt of gratitude to gphin and to ron st john who i hope is in the audience some because not only did gphin find sars early but you may have seen last week that iran announced that they had bird but gphin found the bird flu in iran not february fourteen but last september we need an early warning system to protect us against the things that are humanity 's worst nightmare and so my ted wish is based on the common denominator of these experiences it is a litany it is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases is to find them early and to kill them before they spread so my ted wish is for you to help build a global and what i thought i would call it is early detection but it should really be called because this idea is birthed in ted and i 'd like to call it the international system for total early disease detection so instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu we find it and immediately contain it instead of a novel virus caused by by we find it and we contain it instead of industrial accidents like oil spills or the catastrophe in bhopal we detect it and we respond let 's build an early detection system that 's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language let 's make it transparent housed in a neutral country with redundant backup in a different time zone and a different continent and let 's build it on gphin let 's start with gphin let 's increase the websites that they crawl from twenty thousand to twenty million let 's increase the languages crawl from seven to seventy or more let 's build in outbound confirmation messages using text messages or sms or instant messaging to find out from people who are within one hundred meters of the rumor that you hear if it is in fact valid and let 's add satellite confirmation and we 'll add gapminder 's amazing graphics to the front end and we 'll grow it as finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them and sending our response to them so that next year and be proud that we have done everything we can beginning right now looking on the internet for patterns they can detect something suspicious before who before anyone else can see it give an example of how that could possibly be true you 're not mad about the copyright violation ca no i love it lb well as ron st john i hope you 'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him when he started gphin there was an outbreak of bird flu h5n1 it was in hong kong and a remarkable doctor in hong kong responded immediately by slaughtering one ron and his team in ottawa began to crawl the web only crawling twenty thousand different websites mostly periodicals and they read about and heard about a concern of a they reported this to but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses that looked like before there was gphin one hundred percent of all the world 's reports of bad things the moment these guys in ottawa on a budget of eight hundred thousand dollars a year got cracking what do you think happened to those nations they felt pretty stupid so they started sending in their reports early and now their because other nations have started to report so can you find diseases early by crawling the web of course you can can you find it even earlier than gphin does now of course you can you saw that they found sars using their chinese web crawler a full six weeks before they found it using their english web crawler well they 're only crawling in seven languages these bad viruses really don 't have any intention of showing up first in english or spanish or french"
