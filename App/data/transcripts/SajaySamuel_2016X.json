  "transcript": "forty million americans too poor to pay their way through college they now owe lenders more than one trillion us dollars they do find what jobs they can get even a bankrupt gambler but it is nearly impossible once upon a time in america my friend paul 's father graduated from colorado state university on the gi bill for his generation higher education was free or almost free because it was thought of as a public good when paul also graduated from colorado state university he paid for his english degree by working part time paul 's daughter followed in his footsteps but with one difference when she graduated five years ago it was with a whopping debt students like kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education has become unaffordable for many if not most american families but so what getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off but that 's where the rubber meets the road even a college grad earned ten percent more in two thousand and one than she did in two thousand and thirteen so personal incomes weak is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must make their student loan payments the worst of times i want to speak of three of them today one point two trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy all of us talk about education just as the economists do now as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work as an investment you make to sort and classify people so that employers can hire them more easily world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines the language is peppered with barbarisms teachers are called service providers students are called consumers sociology and shakespeare and soccer and and science all of these are content student debt is profitable only not on you your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry 800 pound gorillas of which sallie mae and navient and just like home mortgages student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and and colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans once from your tuition and then again from the interest on debt with all that money to be made are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising in bait and switch in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate diplomas are a brand many years ago my teacher wrote when students are treated as consumers they 're made prisoners of addiction and envy as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iphone so also people can be sold more and more education college is the new high school we already say that but why stop there people can be upsold on certifications and doctoral degrees higher education is also marketed as a status object but these truths there is not a day that goes by college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator to a middle class life and the usual evidence offered is the college premium a college grad who makes on average fifty six percent more than a high school grad let 's look at that number more carefully because on the face of it it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads working as baristas and cashiers of one hundred people who enroll in any form of post secondary education forty five do not complete it in a timely fashion for a number of reasons including financial and another eighteen are college grads earn more than high school grads but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college now even economists admit going to college but that 's only because high school wages have been cut to the bone for decades workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share of what they have produced and had they received as they should have i think it 's a high school discount two out of three people who enroll are not going to find an adequate job and the future for them and it is they who are going to suffer that 's not just cynical marketing that 's cruel so what do we do do what if students and parents treated higher education everybody else seems to then like any other consumer product you would demand to know what you 're paying for when when you buy a higher educational when you buy a car it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect who knows what to expect from a degree say in there is such a thing by the way what if there was an app for that one that linked up the cost of a major to the or ibt one of you make this discover your reality there are three advantages three benefits to income based tuition such informed users are unlikely why would anybody pay more for college than let 's say fifteen percent of the additional income they earn there 's a second benefit to income based tuition by tying the cost to the income college administrators would be forced to manage costs better to find innovative ways to do so for instance all of you students here pay roughly the same tuition for every major and should change an engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student why should two people buy pay the same but one person receive half or a third of the service some majors while others pay five percent if inequity would end when majors are priced more correctly maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies we know about statistics right but be that as it may the third and biggest benefit of as the gentleman said earlier follow their follow paths of inquiry that they really they really want to after all it was eric and just exactly these kinds of young men thank you for your attention"
