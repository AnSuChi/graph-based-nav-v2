  "transcript": "i was fascinated with all things air and space i would watch nova on pbs our school would show bill nye the science guy when i was in elementary school my next door neighbor he gave me a book for my birthday it was an astronomy book and it was a combination of all these things well and there our team was challenged to create a 3d visualization of the solar system everything i 'm about to do here you can do at home because we built this for the public for you guys to use so we do the opposite of google earth google earth goes from this view down to your backyard we go from this view out to the stars so i 'm going to bring the interface back up we haven 't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites if we did it would be a complete mess because there 's a lot of stuff out there so i 'm going to find the international space station and the other cool thing is so i can slide this jog dial here and now we can see what a sunset on the iss would look like and they get one every ninety minutes all right so what about the rest of you can see there 's saturn there 's jupiter it 's actually pretty busy here we have the mars science laboratory on its way to mars just launched last weekend and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to and i mention this because there 's this strange public perception that nasa 's dead granted we 're not sending humans and we can see and just being able to visit different places and go through different times we have data from one thousand nine hundred and fifty to two thousand and fifty granted we don 't have everything in between because some of the data is hard to get just being able to visit places in different times so i 'm going to open up the destination tab spacecraft outer planet missions voyager one so now we 've gone back in time we 're now riding along with voyager one the date here is november eleven one thousand nine hundred and eighty one second per second and in fact voyager one here flying by titan at it only looks like nothing 's moving because well saturn here is seven hundred thousand miles and we can watch as voyager one flies by titan i 'm going to pull out i want to show you there 's a point to be made here with a 3d visualization like this you can tell the story for yourself you can pause it if you want to keep going if you want to change the camera angle you can do that it actually flies you can see voyager one fly up and i want to show you where voyager one is way beyond our solar system you can you can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself we 're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp and we hope once it 's there you 'll be able to learn for yourself what we 've done out there and what we 're about to do and my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired as i was as a kid to pursue stem education and to pursue a dream in space exploration"
