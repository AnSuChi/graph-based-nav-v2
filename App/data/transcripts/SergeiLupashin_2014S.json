  "transcript": "i came here to show you but before i do that i want to tell you a bit about where it came from what motivated it so i was born in russia and three years ago in two thousand and eleven there were the russian federal elections and no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it now there was a group of photographers who kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby usually photographing things like the sphinx the pyramids who to be right around the corner and they they flew a camera and the image when i saw it it really struck me so in a single image you can really see there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there but you wait a few months a few years and nothing really communicates this scale for example in context in a way that this does but there are a few hurdles and they are quite basic and quite fundamental they flew a camera a five kilogram device with an slr under it it 's lots of spinning you can see that on the back of the pilot 's shirt it says no questions until landing in russian and in english because people are curious and they 'll go tap you and then you lose your focus and things happen and these guys are great they 're professionals but this doesn 't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions so we really have to make piloting easier the other problem is regulations or rather the lack of good regulation for many good reasons it 's just difficult to come up with common sense laws you hear about people with google glass being attacked you hear about actually a drone pilot a hobbyist was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach here 's some personal input i didn 't expect just yesterday i was attacked by a guy who claimed that i was filming him i was checking my email right here easy way to get input for your talk but i think there are better solutions i think we have to defuse the situation we have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety accountability issues so it 's literally a dog leash it 's very convenient there 's no joysticks nothing like this you just turn it on and you point in the direction that you want to fly you give it a little twist that 's kind of the way you communicate the interaction is super simple it 's like a personal flying pet it just always maintains a certain angle to you and if i move around with it it 'll actually follow it 's like so i can press a button and i don 't know about you guys in the front row at least in principle you have to agree that you feel safer because there is a physical connection live demos are hard right things go wrong all the time but no matter what this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you what 's more it tells you immediately that i am the one responsible for this device you don 't have to look for someone controlling it and if i can do this so now we have two eyes in the sky and now the trick is getting them back so my question now to you is what would you use it for what would you use thank you"
