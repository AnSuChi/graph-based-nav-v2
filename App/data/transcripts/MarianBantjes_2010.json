  "transcript": "by reciting a poem oh beloved dentist your rubber fingers in my mouth your voice so soft and muffled i 'm going to be putting the right side of your brains through a fairly serious workout you so i am one of those people with a i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pursue a more personal approach to my work but something weird happened i became bizarrely popular my current work seems to resonate with people in a way that has so taken me by surprise that i still frequently wonder what in the hell is going on and i 'm slowly coming to understand that the appeal of what i do may be connected to why i do it these days i call myself a graphic artist so where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client but i find that for myself without exception the more i deal with the work as something of my own as something that is personal the more successful it is as something that 's compelling so i exist somewhat outside of the mainstream of design thinking i tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities like does it bring joy is there a sense of wonder and does it invoke curiosity i don 't have time to explain it but it has to do with dna and rna so i have a particular imaginative approach to visual work the things that interest me when i 'm working surprise and anything that requires figuring things out u k they have a magazine that they and puzzling it is and these tiling units i designed specifically so that they would contain parts of letterforms within their shapes so that i could then join those pieces together to create letters and then words within the but then as well i was able to just flip them rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns and as you can see it 's extremely difficult to read but maybe that 's a little too obvious working with the art director i 'm able to bring it to just the right point that it 's puzzling for the audience they can figure out that there 's something they have to read but it 's not impossible for them to read i 'm also interested in working with unusual materials and common materials in unusual ways so this requires figuring out how to get the most out of something 's innate properties and also how to bend it to my will so ultimately my goal is to create something unexpected i 've been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life and for that same amount of time i 've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers and eventually i used this technique to create a piece of artwork and then i used it again to create six pieces for stefan 's book things in my life i 've learned so far and these were created without sketches just freehand by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it recently i 've also made some rather highbrow baroque borders out of lowbrow pasta this is what you can do with some household tinfoil 's what i can do with some household tinfoil i 'm very interested in wonder in design as an impetus to inquiring so i 'm currently working on a book which plays with both senses of the word as i explore some of my own ideas and inquiries in a visual display of rather peacock like grandeur so i 'm using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image and i 'm mystified as to why visual wealth is not more commonly used to enhance intellectual wealth but i really hope to have the opportunity to change that perception i 'm nearly done for some reason i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission and this is it just to give you and me a moment to catch up so i do these valentines i 've been sending out valentines on a fairly large scale since two thousand and five these are my valentines from and i started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person but in two thousand and seven i got the cockamamie idea to each valentine for everyone on my mailing list i reduced my mailing list to one hundred and i drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out believe it or not i devised this as a timesaving i was very busy in the beginning of that year and i didn 't know when i was going to find time to design and print a single valentine and i thought that i could kind of do this piecemeal as i was traveling it didn 't exactly but i got an almost one hundred percent response rate laughter and those who didn 't respond will never receive anything from i had this idea that i wanted people to receive a kind of mysterious love letter like a found fragment in their mailbox i wanted it to be something that was not addressed to them or signed by me something that caused them to wonder what on earth this thing was and i specifically wrote four pages that don 't connect there were four different versions of this and i wrote them so i avoid but on the so i wanted people to really get the sense that they had received something that could have been a love letter to them and i 'm just going to read one of them to you but i can assure you that this quirk you 're so self conscious of is intensely endearing and those of us who notice are happy to catch it in passing time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds but without the scratches and bird shit disconcertedly elusive at times but when caught and examined such a delightful reward there 's no passing time with you only collecting the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation and at the same time release release i don 't think so but i just have to tell you because sometimes i hear your self doubt and it 's so crushing to think that you may not know how truly wonderful you are how inspiring and delightful and really truly the most completely and these are currently arriving in mailboxes all around the world i got what i really have to say is a rather brilliant idea to laser cut my valentines out of used christmas cards and i don 't have that much else to say but they turned out really really well i do spend a lot of time on my work and one of the things that i 've been thinking about recently is what is worth while what is it that 's worth spending my time on and my life on in this way but ultimately i don 't consider that a worthy goal what makes something worthwhile for me so i might ask who is it for what does it say and what does it do you know i have to tell you it 's really difficult for someone like me to come ideas and technologies and it 's very very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we 're not contributing enough or worse that all we 're doing is contributing to landfill here i am i 'm showing you some but i 've come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society just in the way that i 'm inspired by books and magazines of all kinds so i also think when i put visual work out there into the mass media work that is interesting unusual intriguing work that maybe opens up that sense of inquiry in the mind that i 'm seeding the imagination of the populace and you just never know who is going to take something from that and turn it into something else because inspiration is so a piece of mine may inspire a playwright and this isn but i really believe that a fully operating rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing so that 's why i do what i do and why i spend so much time and effort on it private sphere of fine art because i want as many people as possible to see my work notice it be drawn into it and be able to take something from it and i actually really feel that it 's worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time and i thank you for allowing me to show it to"
