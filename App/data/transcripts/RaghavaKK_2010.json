  "transcript": "and my school principal a sweet nun flipped through the pages saw all the nudes you know i 'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and i 'd copy her and the nun slapped me on my face and said sweet jesus this kid has already begun i had no clue what she was talking about but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again and you know i got a lot of glorified my school principal put him right on top and gifted it to him and i felt really special she 's the one who taught me how to draw and more importantly how to love she 's a bit of a hippie she said don 't say that but i 'm saying it and you know every time he taught us he 'd say i hate these books because these books are hijacked by industrial and i 'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially and he was very impressed he was all tearing up ready to hug me and i said hold that thought i said can i quit school then but to cut a long story short i quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist i must have done about thirty thousand caricatures i would do birthday parties weddings divorces anything for anyone who wanted to use my services i taught children cartooning and in exchange i learned how to be spontaneous and mad and crazy and fun so i was flipping through the pages of the times of india when i saw that the prime minister of india was visiting my home and if you had to meet bush it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist 's delight i had to meet my prime minister i caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards and what happened was to my luck i saw a nuclear scientist at whose party i had done cartoons i ran up to him and said hello sir how do you do he said what are you doing here raghava i said i 'm here to meet the prime minister salman rushdie was pissed off i think because i altered the map of new york if you notice the next slide i 'm about to show you off the next slide i 'm about is a little more serious i was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published soon after nine eleven what was for me a very naive observation turned out to be a disaster that evening i came home to hundreds of hate mails hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this i was also asked to leave the organization and i wrapped up my pencils and when i went traveling i remember i met this fabulous old man who i met when i was caricaturing who turned out to be an artist in italy he invited me to his studio he said come and visit i saw this dead naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling i am born so i tried going to the art store so i decided i 'm going to learn to paint by myself i 'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how i painted and a little bit about my city except my paintings never danced so i decided i had this crazy and i saw my work come alive you know normally you work in isolation and you show at a gallery but here and it had some other artists working with me the collaborative effort was fabulous i said i 'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody i meet i started doing fashion this is a fashion show we held in london but they 're full of energy this is a work a library i designed i don 't think i 've succeeded but they 've taught me they said stop saying sorry say my bad then i said and these guys and i said how do you paint like that but we 're leaving the city because billboard painters are a dying extinct bunch of artists because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them and since then i 've been painting all over the place this is a painting i did of my wife in since i mentioned my wife the most important collaboration has been with her netra netra and i met when she was eighteen she lived in america she 'd come every two months to visit me and i have and i have to come and see you i did that twice and i went broke and then but it turned out after i sent the works to her that her dad 's friends like most i 'm joking no so netra was stuck with thirty paintings of mine so what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work everything and she became my manager notice one thing we 're equal here something happened along the line but this brought me with netra managing i loved the attention and i said that the best way to celebrate is to marry netra i said let 's get married and i said not just married let 's invite everyone who 's helped us all the people who bought our work and you won 't believe it we put together a list of seven thousand people who had made a difference but i was determined to bring them to india so a lot of them were in india installation artists we had makeup artists jewelry kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation and i had a special installation in tribute to my in laws i had the vegetable carvers work on that for me but all this excitement led to the press writing about us we were in the papers we 're still in the news three years later but unfortunately something tragic happened right after and they said and i started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind of course my work turned but another thing happened the bollywood stars who i would party with and and buy my work disappeared the collectors the friends the press everyone said nice but because i was painting it from my gut this is the beauty i 'm willing to give you it 's politicized of course none of them liked it my works also turned autobiographical at this point something else happened a very very dear friend of mine and it 's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay i was very upset i remember the time when my mother used to dress me up as a little girl that 's me there because she wanted a girl and she has only boys i don 't know what my friends are going to say after this it 's a secret so after this the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing it turned nasty and i 'm a bit of a so i decided and before i did that i quickly studied what can go wrong and this man was elected president of this country you know i sat at home and i watched i teared up and i said that 's where i want to be so netra and i wound i moved back to new york my work has changed everything about my work has this one is called what the fuck was i thinking it talks about mental incest you know but i 'm very civil in my action i assure you and before i go i want to tell you a little story i was talking to mother and father this morning and my dad said i know you have so much you want to say but you have to talk about your work with children i work with children all over the world and that 's an entirely different talk but and belinda and i was told she 's not going to live very long they in fact told me three weeks and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her and we spent a lovely time i told her how i ended up in australia how i backpacked and who i conned and how i got a ticket and all the all the stories and i drew it out for her and then i and within a few days of her death they published a book for thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world"
