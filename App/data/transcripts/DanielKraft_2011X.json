  "transcript": "couple of years ago when i was attending the ted conference in long beach i met harriet we 'd actually met online before not the way you 're thinking we were introduced because we both knew linda avey one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies and because we shared our genetic information with linda she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of mitochondrial dna haplotype which meant we were distantly related we actually share the same genealogy with tzi the iceman so tzi harriet and me and when i met harriet in person the next year at the ted conference she 'd gone online and ordered our own happy haplotype t shirts why am i telling you this story what does it have to do with the future of health well the way i met harriet is an example of how leveraging cross disciplinary exponentially if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day two four eight sixteen in fifteen days you 'd have thirty two thousand what do you think you 'd have in a month we 're at a billion speaking as a physician and innovator we can start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care and to address many of the major challenges and one of the major things we can do the curve to the left we spend most of our money on the last twenty percent of life what if we could incentivize physicians in the health care system and our own selves to move the curve to the left and improve our health leveraging technology as well now my favorite example of exponential technology we all have in our pocket this is the iphone four imagine what the iphone eight will be able to do i 've gained some insight into this i 've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called we bring together each summer about one hundred very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics nanotechnology space and address how we can cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven day executive programs and coming up next month is futuremed a program to help i mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over twenty thousand different mobile apps available there 's one out of the uk where you can pee on a little chip connect it to your iphone and check for an std i don 't know if i 'd try that but it 's available so they can better understand and you can better understand so let 's see how exponential technologies are taking health care let 's start with faster the ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible and we 're layering multiple molecular diagnostics to find and seek things at different levels here you 're going to see the very highest resolution mri scan done today and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even reengineer or backwards engineer the brain so we can better understand psychoactive drugs the scanners for these are getting smaller less expensive and more portable the scan of today takes up about eight hundred books or twenty gigabytes the scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte or eight now there 's essentially virtual colonoscopy compare those two pictures as a radiologist you can basically fly through your patient 's colon and augmenting that with artificial intelligence a lesion that we might have missed but using ai on top of radiology we can find lesions that were missed before maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that wouldn 't have otherwise this is an example of this paradigm shift we 're moving to this integration of biomedicine information technology wireless and i would say mobile now this era of digital medicine even my stethoscope is now digital and of course there 's an app for that we 're moving obviously to the era of the tricorder so the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope these are now at a price point of what used to be one hundred thousand euros or a couple hundred thousand dollars for about five thousand dollars i can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records in the us we 're still less than twenty percent electronic here in the netherlands i think it 's more than eighty percent now that we 're switching to merging medical data making it available electronically we can and now of course we 're in the era of the ipad even the ipad two just last month the first fda approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual watson from ibm beat the two champions in jeopardy so i want you to imagine when in a couple of years when we really have the ai physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done we 're now in the era of virtual visits from skype type visits you can do with american well to cisco that 's developed a very complex health presence system the ability to interact with your health care provider is different and these are being augmented even by our devices again today my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head using simple motion detection using $ one hundred these are being augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now we already have wireless scales you step on the scale tweet your weight to your friends they can keep you in line we have wireless blood pressure cuffs a whole gamut of technologies are being put together instead of wearing kludgy devices we put on a simple patch this was developed completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity there 's watches that measure your heart rate zeo sleep monitors a suite of tools that enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health as we start to integrate this information we 'll know better what to do with it there 's even mirrors that can pick up your pulse rate and i would argue in the future we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes seven and just like the onstar system in cars your red light might go on for those of you with with kiddos at home how would you like a wireless diaper that supports your more information i think than you might need but it 's going to be here do the important human touch elements of we 're now in the era of and now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like where the tumor is where the blood vessels are and we 're entering an era of truly scarless surgery called notes where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way how about controlling other elements for those who have disabilities the and they can control a cursor or a wheelchair or potentially a robotic arm these devices are getting smaller and going built by dean kamen and colleagues which has seventeen degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who 's lost a limb to have much higher dexterity or control than they 've had in the past so we 're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually if you haven 't lost a limb but had a stroke you can wear these augmented limbs or if you 're a paraplegic i 've visited the folks at berkeley bionics they 've developed elegs and by leveraging these sorts of technologies who 's a professor at mit and now both of them can climb better move faster swim differently with their prosthetics the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction including with huge costs but the trend in medicine is to get exponentially smaller a few examples we 're now in the era of fantastic voyage the ipill you can swallow this completely integrated device it can take pictures of your sometimes these might and be augmented in that reality on the cardiac side pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so no need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them and they 'll be wirelessly telemetered how about having the the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing we can now leverage microfluidics like this chip made by steve quake at stanford microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians put it on a chip enable thousands of tests at the point of care anywhere in the world this will really leverage technology to the rural and the underserved and enable what used to be thousand dollar tests to be done for pennies and at the point of care we 're entering the era of nanomedicine the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that monitor not something we usually think about in the era of medicine but hard disks used to be four hundred dollars for ten megabytes exponentially cheaper in genomics now the genome cost about a billion dollars about ten years ago when the first one came out we 're now approaching essentially a $ one thousand genome probably next year and in two years a $ one hundred genome what will we do with $ one hundred genomes soon we 'll have millions of these tests available then it gets interesting when we start to crowd source which don 't work for the individual many different companies are working on on leveraging these approaches i 'll show you a simple example from 23andme again my data indicates i 've got about average risk for example it might change my behavior my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics how my genes modulate individuals and patients will make better drug dosing and selection available geomedicine where you live what you 've been exposed to can dramatically affect your health we can capture that information genomics proteomics the environment all this data streaming at us individually and as physicians how do we manage it we 're now entering the era of systems medicine systems biology where we can start to integrate this is called by lee hood the father of the field and know what you 're likely to have we can be preventative that prevention can be personalized more importantly it 'll be increasingly participatory through websites like patientslikeme or managing your data on microsoft healthvault or google health leveraging this together in participatory ways will be increasingly important i that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy how about more targeted therapies for cancer i 'm an oncologist and know that most of what we give is essentially poison we learned at stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells the ones that seem to be really responsible for we often can whack the weed we 're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long term cure analyze the tumor and come up with a specific cocktail for the individual patient i 'll close with regenerative medicine i 've studied a lot about stem cells we 've been using adult stem cells in clinical trials for about fifteen years to approach a whole we take our own bone marrow cells i invented a device called the marrowminer a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow it 's now been fda approved hopefully on the market in the next year we can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in the same patient making personalized stem cell lines i think there 'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells should you need them and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing replacing the ink with cells and essentially building enable but often i think we 'll enter a new era that i like to call stage zero medicine thanks very much"
