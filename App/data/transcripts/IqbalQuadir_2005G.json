  "transcript": "i mean there is plenty of knowledge and and i think so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see see whether it 's contributing or contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it and by and large this has failed and economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it did not work so the question is why is that yesterday i was walking across the street and they showed three bishops were executed five hundred years ago right across the street and in the end there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and so you can see the real process of and this is backed up by this came down but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last sixty years aid actually did the opposite marginalized citizens the authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and in fact if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the brains what have you and if you if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people by the people for the people and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard then things would improve and to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the world bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments just see the contrast and that is the perspective i have and and so twelve years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had our colleagues were connected by a computer network and we got more productive because we didn 't have to exchange floppy disks we could update each other more more often but one time it broke down and it reminded me of a day and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural area and and i walked and he wasn 't there so i walked all afternoon back i put those two experiences together side by side i the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon and if that 's the case then and it turns out that there was one telephone in bangladesh for every five hundred people so just imagine how many if you just multiply by one hundred million so if you lose so i started looking for any evidence that does connectivity really increase productivity i couldn 't find much really but i found this graph produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the where the gnp per capita is let 's say five hundred dollars or three hundred dollars then the impact is huge six thousand dollars or five thousand dollars the question was how much did it cost so if you spend two thousand dollars and if five thousand dollars every year and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there 's a digital revolution going on then it would be even and i knew a little economics by then it says and so the point is that we could only the only way we could but so the question was i started looking at this issue and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of why do we have to worry about that i mean in america people buy then what about initial buying question is why can 't we have some kind of shared access in the united states we have and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u s because there were there were people who had computers they had so for example we didn 't have ways to have credit checks but that 's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people and had one thousand and they had these branches i thought i could put cell towers and create a network and anyway to cut the time short so i started i first went to them and said you know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons they had to be so i started focusing what is it that they really do so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan but it 's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow two hundred dollars from the bank and they thought for a while and they said it 's a little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen so i quit my job i went back to i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means people 's phone and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world after about a million miles substantial loss of hair i eventually put together a which provided the know how and the grameen bank provided the infrastructure to to spread the service to make the story short here is the coverage of the country you can see it 's pretty much covered but we are also investing around another three hundred million dollars this year now about that cow model i talked about there are about one hundred and it 's serving thousand villages which represent about eighty million people and these these phones and two dollars profit per which is like seven hundred dollars per year and of course it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways it increases income improves welfare result is right now this company is is the largest telephone company with three point five million subscribers one hundred and fifteen thousand of these phones i talked about that produces about a third of the traffic in the network and two thousand and four the net profit after taxes very serious taxes and the company contributed about one hundred and ninety million dollars here are some of the lessons the government needs to provide economically viable services actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that governments need to subsidize private companies this is what some people think and actually private companies help governments with taxes poor people are recipients poor people are a resource services cost too much for the poor their involvement reduces the cost the poor are uneducated and cannot do much they are very eager learners and very capable survivors i 've been very surprised most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day poor countries need aid businesses this one company has raised the if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company is raising the gnp of the country much more than the aid the country receives and as i was trying to show you as far as i 'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens and this is a new project i have with dean kamen the famous inventor in america he has produced some which we are now doing an experiment in bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is which is running these generators and each of these generators is selling electricity to twenty houses each it 's just an experiment we don 't know how far it will go"
