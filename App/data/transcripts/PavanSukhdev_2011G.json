  "transcript": "but we need to do something about this problem i began my life as as a markets professional and but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature and which doesn 't get priced by the markets and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern they asked themselves a question if economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change well why can 't the same be done for conservation why can 't an equivalent case be made for nature ecosystems species and genes across many scales international national local community and which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many many researchers and amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation we were losing natural capital the benefits that flow from nature to us we were losing it at an extraordinary rate this came out in two thousand and eight which was of course around the time that the banking crisis had shown that we had lost financial capital of the order of two and a half trillion dollars so this was comparable in size to that kind of loss we then have gone on local governments and for business and for people for you and me a whole slew of reports which were presented at the u n last year which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it what is this about a picture that you 're familiar with it 's a massive store of carbon it 's an amazing store of biodiversity but what people don 't really know is this also is a rain factory because the northeastern trade winds as they go over the amazonas effectively gather the water vapor something like twenty billion tons per day of water vapor this rainfall cycle this rainfall factory effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of two hundred and forty billion but the question arises okay so how much do uruguay paraguay argentina and indeed the state of mato grosso in brazil pay for that vital input to that economy that 's the economic invisibility of nature that can 't keep going on because economic incentives and and unless we address which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset it we see the same problem again and again it 's been estimated that insect based pollination bees pollinating fruit and so on is something like one hundred and ninety billion dollars worth that 's something like eight percent of the total agricultural output completely passes below the radar screen but when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice once again which is to whom should this get paid if it could belong to anyone to a local community of poor people and if you look at the species level the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant the artisanal fisher folk and those who fish for their own livelihoods to feed their families something like a people depend on fish the quantity of fish in the oceans a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein and at this rate at which we are losing fish it is a human problem of enormous dimensions a health problem whether it 's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats or whether it 's the ability of their wives to go and and collect fuel wood from the forest it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services even though ecosystem services these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free they 're not very big in percentage terms of gdp two that 's the difference because these are important that is ecological infrastructure how bad can things get well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance it if you start green it 's like eighty to one hundred percent if it 's yellow it 's forty to sixty percent and these are percentages versus the original state so to speak the europe sub saharan africa as we move on and consume places like the gobi desert like the tundra and like the sahara the reason this is happening boils down in my mind to one basic problem which is our inability to perceive the difference we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth it 's common goods and here 's an example from thailand where we found that because the value of a mangrove is not that much it 's about $ six hundred over the life of nine years that this has been measured but of $ twelve thousand of cost and that answer is more like $ if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits you get a completely different answer which is clearly and here 's what the same calculation looks like which was done recently well i say recently over the last ten years by a group called trucost this is basically business as usual which causes it causes pollutants being issued which have an economic cost health cost and so on if you drill water to make coke near a village farm that 's not illegal but yes it costs the community we don 't include our biggest asset when we measure corporate performances we don 't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society that was in the early 2000s when india was going gung ho about gdp growth as the means forward looking at china with its stellar growths of eight nine ten percent and wondering why can we do the same and that 's how my interests began and went to the teeb project and the world bank has acknowledged this and they 've started a project called waves wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem and actually we 've done this with the teeb project we 've done this for a very difficult case this is important because in china in one thousand nine hundred and ninety seven the yellow river actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society just a year later the yangtze flooded causing something like and the chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling a retrospective on forty years shows that if we had accounted for these costs the cost of loss of topsoil the cost of loss of the loss to local communities as a result of all these factors desertification and so on those costs the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china of course after the event one can be wise the way to do this is to do it on a company basis to take leadership forward and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost and to disclose these answers someone once asked me but if we look at companies like puma jochen once challenged me at a function saying that he 's going to implement my project before i finish it well i think we kind of did it at the same time but he 's done it he 's basically worked the cost to puma puma has two point seven billion dollars of turnover three hundred million dollars of profits ninety four million dollars of externalities cost to business now that 's not a happy situation for them but they have the confidence and the courage to come here 's what we are measuring we are measuring it because we know that you cannot manage what you do not measure that 's an example i think for us to look at and for us to draw comfort from if more companies did this and if more sectors engaged this as sectors you could have analysts business analysts and you could have people like us and consumers and and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies today we can 't yet do that but i think the path is laid out this can be done and i 'm delighted that the institute of chartered accountants in the already set up a coalition to do this an international coalition the other favorite if you like solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets and by the way these are my favorites externalities calculation and green carbon markets teeb has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem and you name it but these are the favorites you over issue currency you get what you see but that 's all about energy and industry but what we 're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon that the flux in other words the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa is more or less balanced in fact what 's being absorbed is something like there 's deforestation and there 's emission of methane from agriculture through a structure through a mechanism called redd plus a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation so we actually have some movement forward but the thing is to do a lot more of that will this solve coral reefs as you can see madagascar and to the west of the caribbean these red dots these red areas basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people so that 's almost an eighth of society and the sad thing is that as these coral reefs are lost and scientists tell us that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above three hundred and fifty parts per million is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs we are not only risking the extinction of the entire coral species the warm water corals we 're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods of more than so in selecting targets of four hundred and fifty parts per million and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations what we have done is we 've made an ethical choice we 've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs well what i will say to you in parting is that we may have done that let 's think about it and what it means but please let 's not do more of that because mother nature only has that much in ecological thank you"
