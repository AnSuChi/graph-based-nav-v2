  "transcript": "i 've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals but that isn 't how my life turned out in fact i 've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades perhaps my proudest accomplishment after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job my new haven analyst dr white announced to now i 'm going to quote from some of my writings steve would later tell me that for all the times he had seen me psychotic nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day i walked as though my legs were wooden my face looked and felt like a mask the room a shambles and to this day he 'll say i was as bad as any he had ever seen ' hi crumbling world word voice tell the clocks to stop time is time has come ' ' white is leaving ' steve said somberly ' i 'm being pushed into a grave the situation is grave ' i moan ' gravity is pulling me down i 'm scared tell them to get away ' as a young woman i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods my doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia fortunately i did not actually enact that grave prognosis instead i 'm a chaired professor of law psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law i have many close friends and i have a beloved he 's definitely the star of my show i 'd like to share with you how that happened and also describe my experience of being psychotic its defining feature is psychosis delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren 't responsive to evidence and hallucinations are false sensory experiences i sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain occasionally i have hallucinations like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife often speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence and if the words get jumbled up enough it 's called word salad contrary to what many people think schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality the schizophrenic mind is not split but shattered ill fed standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic and there are people with the illness quoting from my writings my two classmates rebel and val and i to meet in the law school library on friday night to work on our memo assignment together but we didn 't get far before i was talking in ways that made no sense ' memos are visitations ' i informed them ' they make certain points the point is on your head pat used to say that have you killed you anyone ' rebel and val looked at me as if they or i had been splashed in the face with cold water ' what are you talking about elyn ' ' oh you know the usual who 's what what 's who heaven and hell let 's go out on the roof it 's a flat surface it 's safe ' rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me ' this is the real me ' i announced waving my arms above my head and then late on a friday night on the roof of the yale law school i began to sing and not quietly either ' come to the florida sunshine bush do you want to dance ' ' are you on drugs where there are lemons where they make demons ' ' you 're frightening me ' one of them said and rebel and val headed back into the library i shrugged and followed them back inside i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was ' i think someone 's infiltrated i don 't believe in joints but they do hold your body together ' it 's an example of loose associations and once there i couldn 't settle down my head was too full of noise too full of orange trees and law memos i could not write and mass murders i knew i would be responsible for sitting on my bed i rocked back and moaning in fear and isolation i had two earlier in england continuing with the writings the next morning i went to my professor 's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before and he eventually brought me to the emergency room once there someone i 'll just call ' the doctor ' and his whole team of goons swooped down lifted me high into the air and slammed me down on a metal bed with such force that i saw stars half scream barely human and pure terror then the sound came again forced from somewhere deep inside my belly and scraping my throat raw this incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization one of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that i was gravely disabled to support this view they wrote in my chart that i was unable to do my yale law school homework i wondered what that meant about much of the rest of new haven during the next year i would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital at times i spent up to twenty hours in mechanical restraints arms tied arms and legs tied down i never made any direct threats if you 've never been restrained yourself you may have a benign image of the experience there 's nothing benign about it every week in the united states it 's been estimated that one to three people die it 's unclear whether using mechanical restraints is actually saving lives or costing lives while i was preparing to write my student note for the yale law journal on mechanical restraints i consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading painful and frightening he looked at me in a knowing way and said they 're different from me and you they wouldn 't experience restraints as we would i didn 't have the courage to tell him in that moment that no we 're not that different from him we don 't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would in fact until very recently and i 'm sure some people still hold it as a view that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe i 've never met a psychiatric patient who agreed with today i 'd like to say i 'm very pro psychiatry but very eventually i came to los angeles to teach at the university of southern california law school for years i had resisted medication making many many efforts to get off i felt that if i could manage without medication i could prove that after all i wasn 't really mentally ill it was some terrible mistake my motto was the less medicine the less defective my l a analyst dr kaplan was urging me just to stay on medication and get on with my life quoting from the text i started the reduction of my and within a short time crouched down covered my face and began shaking kaplan would later describe me as ' writhing in agony ' the mission is not yet complete immediately after the appointment with kaplan i went to see dr marder a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects folded over and began muttering ' head explosions and people trying to kill is it okay if i totally trash your office ' ' you need to leave if you think you 're going to do that ' said marder marder ' okay small fire on ice tell them not to kill me tell them not to kill me what have i done wrong hundreds of thousands with thoughts interdiction ' ' i think you need to be in the hospital i could get you admitted right away and the whole thing could be very discrete ' ' ha ha ha you 're offering to put me in i 'm god or i used to be ' at that point in the text where i said i 'm god or i used to be my husband made a marginal note he said did you quit or were you fired ' i give life and i take it away forgive me for i know not what i do ' eventually i broke down in front of friends and everybody convinced me to take more medication i could no longer deny the truth and i could not change it elyn professor saks separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past lay smashed and in ruins and i am i think for three reasons first i 've had excellent treatment four to five day a week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and third i work at an enormously supportive workplace at usc law school this is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them it 's also a very intellectually stimulating and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most wonderful family and friends supportive work environment i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life and that 's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i didn 't feel safe with people knowing if you hear nothing else and these people may be your spouse they may be your child they may be your neighbor they may be your friend they may be your coworker so let me share some final thoughts the better we understand these illnesses the better the treatments we can provide and the better the treatments we can provide the more we can offer people care and not have to use force i could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself a message to the entertainment industry and to the press on the whole you 've done a wonderful job portray them sympathetically and portray them in all the richness friend posed a question if there were a pill i could take that would instantly cure me would i take it the poet rainer maria rilke was offered psychoanalysis he declined saying don 't take my devils away because my angels may flee too so would i take the pill in an instant nor am i asking anyone for their pity what i rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share is more important than the mental illness we may not what those of us who suffer with mental illness want is what everybody wants in the words of sigmund freud to work and to love"
