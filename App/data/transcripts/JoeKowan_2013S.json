  "transcript": "and it didn 't even matter until i was twenty seven that 's when i started writing songs and even then i only played them for myself just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable i couldn 't do it i had this irrational fear and the more i practiced the more i wanted to perform so on the week of my 30th birthday i decided i was going to go to this local open and put this fear behind me well when i got there it was packed there were like twenty people there pretty good until about ten minutes before my turn when my whole body rebelled and this wave of anxiety just washed over me now when you experience fear your sympathetic nervous system kicks in so you have a rush of next your non essential systems start to shut down like digestion your pupils dilate your muscles contract your spidey sense tingles basically your whole body that condition is not conducive to performing folk music and it still can 't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and twenty folksingers on a tuesday night open mic i have never been more terrified and this completely horrible vibrato you know when your voice wavers comes streaming out and this is not the good kind of vibrato like an opera singer has this is my whole body just convulsing with fear i mean it 's a nightmare i 'm embarrassed the audience is clearly uncomfortable they 're focused on my discomfort it was so bad but that was my first real experience as a solo singer songwriter and something good did happen i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for and i wanted more but i knew i had to get past that night i promised myself i would go back every week and sure enough week after week it didn 't get any better the same thing happened every week and i remember it really well because i don 't have a lot of all i had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness that only seems authentic when i have stage fright and the more nervous i was the better the song would be so i started writing a song about having stage fright first and then accounting for things like my shaky voice and i knew i would be singing about a half octave higher than normal because i was nervous and we were all one big happy nervous uncomfortable family laughter by thinking about my audience by embracing and exploiting my problem i was able to take something that was blocking my progress and turn it into something that was essential for my success and eventually over time i didn 't have to play the stage fright song at all except for when i was really would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you was nervous"
