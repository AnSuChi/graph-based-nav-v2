  "transcript": "data can actually make us more human recently a wise media theorist tweeted the 19th century and the culture of the 21st century will be defined by the interface and i believe this is going to prove true this is a project called flight patterns what you 're looking at is airplane traffic over north america for a 24 hour period you see san francisco and los angeles start to make their journeys down to hawaii in the lower this is a time lapse image of that exact same data but i 've color coded it by type so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us and so here we can see the the white represents low altitudes and the blue are higher altitudes you can see this is a major shipping airport and there 's all kinds of activity there you can see some of the chaos that 's happening in new york with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other and that 's us down there in l a and long beach on the bottom i started taking a look as well at different this is visualizing international and it had a live feed with a 24 hour offset so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through at & t 's data this is another project i worked on with sensible cities lab and it 's visualizing sms messages being sent in the city of amsterdam until we approach new year 's eve where everybody says happy new year and then you 're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the and it 's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well except for one thing it 's not a robot at all there 's actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player this was the inspiration for a web service by amazon called the mechanical turk named after this guy and it 's based on the that there are certain things that are easy for people but really difficult for computers so they made this web service and said any programmer can write a piece of software and tap into the minds of thousands of people the nerdy side of me thought wow this is amazing i can tap into thousands of people 's minds and the other nerdy side of me thought this is horrible this is completely bizarre what does this mean for the future of mankind where we all plugged into this borg i was probably being a little extreme but what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we 're working on and we 're just doing these little labors i asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left and i said i 'll pay you two cents for your contribution and i collected i took the first ten thousand sheep that i collected and i put them on a website called you can 't pick individual sheep but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity and juxtaposed against this grid you see actually by rolling over each individual one the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process i think there 's something really interesting to watching people as they i think it was really interesting to kind of amazing what some people did approximate collection rate of eleven sheep per hour which would make a working wage of sixty nine cents per hour there were six hundred and sixty two rejected sheep that didn 't meet sheep like criteria and were thrown out of the flock the amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to forty six minutes that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and there were seven thousand five hundred and ninety nine but only one of them out of the seven thousand five hundred and ninety nine said this which i was pretty surprised by i expected people to i think it 's a pretty valid question and obviously we it 's about your own interpretation and doing something different so i thought this was an interesting clip to divide into sixteen pieces and feed into the mechanical turk with a drawing so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into ten thousand teeny pieces and we fed those into the mechanical turk we asked people to draw what it was that they so we took these hundred dollar bills and we put them on a website called this is again showing all the different contributions you see some did beautiful stipple renderings like this one on top spent a long time making realistic versions and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces here on the right hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing $ zero point zero one all i 'm getting paid for this so the last mechanical turk project i 'm going to talk to you about is called bicycle built for two thousand this is a collaboration with my friend daniel massey you may recognize it from two thousand and one a space odyssey when hal 's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song as a reference to when so we resynthesized this this is what that sounded like we broke down all the individual notes in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing this is what it would look like if you went to the site you type in your code but you first test your mic you 'd be fed a simple audio clip into the mechanical turk with so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative distributed music making where nobody has any idea what it is they 're working on so if you go bicyclebuiltfortwothousand com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together i 'm sorry for this the so basically motion through 3d space and this was seen by a director in l a named james frost who said wait a minute you mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video and i think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers but we also open sourced it and we made it released as a google code project where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it and people were making some amazing things this is actually two of my favorites the pin board thom yorke and a lego thom yorke a whole youtube channel of people submitting really interesting content and we started bouncing around ideas but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build build something for so we put the idea on the back burner for a few months and he ended up talking to rick rubin who was finishing up johnny cash 's final album called ain 't no grave the lyrics to the leading track are ain 't no grave can hold my body down so we thought this was the perfect project to build a collaborative memorial and a virtual resurrection for johnny cash and he made this amazing flash drawing tool as you know an animation is a series of images we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically time to play the entire thing for you but i want to show you two short clips one is the beginning of the music video and that 's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly what better way to pay tribute to the man than to for one of his songs collaborator i felt really sad when he died and i just thought it 'd be wonderful it 'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory through problems until my little wee battles that i was fighting within the picture all so if you go to the website what you 'll see is the video playing above and if you find one that you 're interested in you can get the playback and personal contribution in addition to that it 's listed the artist 's name the location which ends up getting a little bit crazy so the last project i want to talk to you about is another collaboration with chris milk and this is called the wilderness downtown it 's an online music video for the arcade fire chris and i were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers where you have html5 audio and video and the power of javascript to render amazingly fast and we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the window and try to make it play but most importantly i think we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone so the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up and you type in the address it actually creates a music video specifically for you pulling in google maps and streetview images into the experience itself so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address but i 'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect the and as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data we have an opportunity and maybe even an obligation thanks a lot"
