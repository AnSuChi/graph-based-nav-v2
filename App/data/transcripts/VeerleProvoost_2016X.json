  "transcript": "today we have adoption many parents face tough questions and tough decisions shall we tell our child about the sperm donation if so when what words to use sperm donors are often referred to as biological fathers but should we really be using the word father as a philosopher and social scientist i have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood i will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions but i will also show you the parents ' uncertainties using sperm from a donor in this treatment timeline you can see two points at which we conducted interviews we included heterosexual couples where the man for some reason did not have good quality sperm and lesbian couples we also included children i wanted to know how those children define concepts like parenthood and family in fact that is what i asked them i drew an apple tree instead i could ask abstract philosophical questions in a way that did not make them run off by designing techniques like this i asked them and i would ask questions one started with boxer i asked them about their birth before you were born it was just your mom and dad or mom and mommy can you tell me how you came into the family one said and they put them in a big jar my mommy went there and she she put the seeds in her belly somehow and her belly grew really big and there i was hmm i asked questions about him using their own words i said if this would be an apple what would you do with it and one boy was thinking out loud holding the apple and he said but i will not put him on the ground that 's too cold and too hard because he made my family possible and i would not be here so also parents constructed family tales tales to tell their children and why not it 's their way of explaining their and we had another couple who made books a book for each child they were really works of containing their thoughts and feelings throughout the treatment they even had the hospital parking tickets in there finding ways words and images to tell your family story to your child and these stories were highly diverse but they all had it was a tale of longing for a child these parents also wanted to justify their decisions through the tales they tell underlying was a fear and that fear is understandable because we live in a very and geneticized society i want to tell you and he yelled you 're telling me what to do you 're not even my father that was exactly what the parents in our study feared but it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting he said this outburst had nothing to do with the lack of it was about it will pass what this man shows us we should not immediately think it is because the family is a little different and every now and then all parents may wonder am i a good enough parent these parents too when they first saw the counselor they paid close attention to the counselor even ten years later they still remember the advice they were given so when they thought about the counselor and the advice they were given we discussed that and we saw one when our son asks us ' do i have a dad ' we will say ' no you do not have a dad ' but we will say nothing more not unless he asks because he might not be ready for that the counselor said so well i don 't know that 's quite different from how we respond to children 's questions like milk is that made in a factory we will not say no milk is not made in a factory and of course these children noticed that one boy said but they acted really weird i just go and ask her but his parents did not notice and it certainly was not what they had in mind nor what the counselor had in mind when they were saying how important it is to be an when we offer people pills we gather evidence first and advice it is not enough for advice or for professionals to give advice that is or well meant it should be advice that there is evidence for so the philosopher in me would now i would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families when parents do things work for them they do brilliant things what i want you to remember as members of families in no matter what form or shape is that what families need and we do not need to be professionals to create those most of us do just fine we can do with some advice bear in mind three things work with advice that works for your family remember you 're the expert because you live your family thank you"
