  "transcript": "at every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we 're going to become and then when we become those people we 're not always thrilled with the decisions we made so young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get middle aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry older adults work hard to lose what middle aged adults worked hard to gain on and on and on the question is as a psychologist that fascinates me is why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret i think one of the reasons i 'll try to convince you today is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time but what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl is it teenage years is it middle age is it old wherever now happens to be what i want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion an illusion has just come to an end that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives me give you some data to back up that claim so here 's a study of change in people 's personal values over time here 's three values everybody here holds all of them but you probably know that as you grow as you and the others to eighteen first of all you are right change does slow it doesn 't slow nearly as much as we think at every age from eighteen to sixty eight in our data set people vastly underestimated how much change we call this the end of history illusion and also how much they but at every you can ask people about their likes and dislikes their basic preferences for example name your best friend your favorite kind of vacation what 's your favorite hobby what 's your favorite kind of music people can name these things we ask half of them to tell us do you think that that will change over the next ten years and half of them to tell us did that change over the last ten years and what we you 've seen it twice now and here it is again and yet people who are ten years older all say eh you know that 's really changed does any of this matter is this just a form of mis prediction that doesn 't have consequences no it matters quite a bit and i 'll give you an example of why in important ways bring to mind right now for yourself your your favorite musician today and your favorite musician ten years ago i put mine up on the screen to help you along now we asked people to predict for us to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert ten years from now and on average people and yet when we asked them how much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite ten years ago perform today they say only eighty dollars now in a perfectly rational world these should be the same number but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability why does this not entirely sure but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining most of us can remember who we were ten years ago but we find it hard to imagine who we 're going to be sorry when people say i can 't imagine that they 're usually talking about their own lack of imagination and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they 're describing is time is a powerful force it transforms our preferences it reshapes our values it alters our personalities it 's as if for most of us the it 's the moment at which we finally become ourselves human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they 're finished the person you are right now is as transient as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you 've ever been the one constant in our life is change thank you"
