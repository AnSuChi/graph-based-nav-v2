  "transcript": "like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband it was a city so long ago that it was so i sino soviet relations what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then i 'd pump him for information only he was the china representative for the american soybean association you told me you were a fulbright scholar you have talked to me if i told you we 're in soybeans we did and what an alive man terence bryan foley turned out to be he was a chinese scholar who later and the world so when we we believed that if we were smart enough we could keep him from the surgeon emerged from the surgery what 'd he say he said what surgeons always say we got it all then there was a setback when the pathologists it turned out to be a rare exceedingly aggressive type with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in and yet he lived on he built a playhouse for our daughter i 'm looking for a cure so a year goes by before the cancer as cancers do it makes him so sick he has to quit it yet still he lives on we take the kids to australia and then more years pass the cancer begins to grow they 're exotic they 're experimental and for the third time we 've dodged now i ask you how do i feel when the time finally comes sometime between midnight and two a m this time it 's on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that i 've never met before so what do i say when he says what do you want me to do so what do i say i say keep him alive if you can so we fought we struggled we triumphed it was an exhilarating fight and i 'd repeat the fight today without a moment 's hesitation it turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious it was also an expensive fight and we pushed the fight right over the edge and i never got the chance to say to him what i say to him now almost every day hey buddy it was a hell of a ride we never got the chance to so what why everyone around us did what they did and what did i discover well one of the things i discovered is that experts think that one answer to the advance directive to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices yet both of them said the same thing do nothing if there is no further hope i knew terence 's wishes as clearly and as surely as i knew my own yet we just kept redefining i could keep him i felt strongly and powerfully and you might say could keep him from dying ever now what do the experts call this they say it 's denial it 's a strong word isn 't it yet i will tell you that denial isn 't even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through and i hear the medical professionals how can they insist on this treatment at the end it 's so clear yet they 're in denial now i think this maybe isn 't a very useful way of thinking it you out there you want to do i saw it firsthand just days before terence died yet ira byock the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal so what the experts call denial i call and i 'd like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design it 's a feature laughter so we need to think more constructively about it 's part of the human condition and yet our system and our thinking isn 't built to accommodate it so terence told me a story on that long ago night and i believed it maybe i wanted to believe it and during terence 's giving up the fight for that 's how it felt it felt like giving up meant giving up not only his life but and for the doctors the story of themselves as healers so what do we need maybe we need a new story not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness but rather a story of victory and triumph of a valiant battle a graceful retreat a story that acknowledges and that no wife no matter how hard she tried has ever and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go people did mention hospice but i wouldn 't listen hospice was for people who were dying and terence wasn 't dying as a result he spent just four days in hospice which i 'm sure as you all know is a pretty typical outcome and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end but there doesn 't seem to be a noble path to dying and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together heroic narrative for letting go so and maybe our new story will be about a hero 's fight and a hero 's goodbye terence loved you know mark antony the and and it 's time to let go and he tells him how to say a noble goodbye a goodbye that 's fit for but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward as a last enjoyment listen to the sounds exquisite instruments of the musical troops and bid her farewell the alexandria you are losing that 's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life almost anything was possible a goodbye for a man who kept and isn 't that what we 're missing how can we learn that people 's decisions about their loved ones the overwhelming presence of hope and maybe it 's time our healthcare system doctors it 's a feature"
