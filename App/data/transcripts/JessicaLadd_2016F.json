  "transcript": "is excited to be going to college she couldn 't wait to get out of her parents ' house to prove to them that she 's an adult and to prove to her new friends that she belongs let 's call him mike the next day hannah wakes up with a pounding headache she can only remember the night in flashes but what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside mike 's room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her wanting it to stop then shakily stumbling home but she thinks maybe this is just what sex in college is less than ten percent will ever report their assault to their or to the police and those who do on average wait eleven months to make the report after graduation hannah learns that she was one of five women who mike did the exact same thing to and this is not an unlikely scenario because ninety percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders but with such low reporting rates it 's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported much less anything happen if they are in fact only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison now i 'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training i 'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good so this to me is a tragic but a solvable problem and so we did we started by talking to college survivors and what they wish they 'd had in college is pretty simple they wanted a website one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them with clearly written information about their reporting options with the ability to electronically report their assault rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them and perhaps most critically with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant you see knowing that you weren 't the only one changes everything it changes the way you frame your own experience it changes the way you think about your perpetrator it means that if you do come forward you 'll have someone else 's back and they 'll have yours we created a website that actually does this and we launched it [ and we included a unique matching system where if mike 's first victim and mike 's second victim had done the same thing a few months later they would have matched and the verified contact information of both survivors would have been sent to the authorities at the same time for investigation and follow up and that mike would have been kicked off campus gone to jail or at least gotten the help that he needed and if we were able to stop repeat offenders like mike after just their second assault following a match survivors like hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place we percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on and because we 're creating a real deterrent to assault for perhaps the first time maybe the mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone the type of system i 'm describing meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre agreed upon conditions are met such as a match but the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace we don 't have to live in a world where rapists get away with it we can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable where survivors get the support and justice they deserve where the authorities get the information they need and where there 's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being"
