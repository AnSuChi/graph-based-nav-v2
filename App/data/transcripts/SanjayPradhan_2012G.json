  "transcript": "i remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep my brothers and i dug in and that 's when my father came home and i still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us later i understood why my father got so upset those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract even though he was harassed and threatened his was a lonely struggle where public officials were enriching themselves [ rather ] than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling i experienced this most viscerally when i traveled when i was famished and just at that time one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days this profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life i resolved to give back which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries my initial work focused on i remember a trip in uganda where i found and the poor once again without any voice or recourse it was bihar all over again and the work i did in uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems has been practiced since when winners of world war ii five hundred founding fathers and that traditional approach to development had three key elements accompanied by reform prescriptions second the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment open knowledge and together they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems i witnessed in uganda you know developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the u s europe or the world bank they get their inspiration their hope they want to know how china lifted five hundred million people out of poverty in thirty years how mexico 's oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children this is the new ecosystem and even south to north with mexico 's oportunidades and transfers are opening up so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers this is the second shift and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance take geomapping and the darker the shade of green the more the number of so this simple mashup reveals provoking new questions is development assistance targeting those who most need our help the world bank has now geomapped thirty thousand project activities in one hundred and forty three countries and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects this is a tremendous leap forward and this leads me to the third and in my view the most significant shift in development open governance governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability from the arab spring to the anna hazare movement in india using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability several governments in africa and eastern europe are opening their budgets to the public but you know there is a big difference between a budget that 's public and a budget that 's accessible this is a public budget and as you can see it 's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources to tackle this problem governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it 's more understandable to the public the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools and the red color shows the opposite tools like this help turn and what 's exciting there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government parents and students can give real time feedback on a website and the government is responsive so for instance when it was reported on this website that eight hundred students were at risk and you know what 's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south from the philippines to indonesia moldova and beyond even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations but within a few university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform and what is very exciting aggregated in the red bubbles that you see provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor even bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent accessible but you know in many parts of the world governments are not interested in opening up or and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system these are the lonely warriors like my father and many many others and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together courageous reformers from civil society parliament and government have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector galvanized by this reformers in parliament are now investigating dubious contracts these examples give new hope new possibility two years ago on april 8th two thousand and ten and at age eighty he was typing a public interest litigation against corruption in a road project though he was no lawyer and he died increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty not only did government officials need to be honest but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape the collective voices of the poor"
