  "transcript": "the great privilege of traveling to some incredible places photographing these but people think it 's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows reality it looks more something like this laughter this is my office we can 't afford the fanciest places to stay at night so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors going to eat a large rodent called a cuy but what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that and those times of despair we think hey there might be an image to be made here there might be a story to be told and why is storytelling important well it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage and in the southeast there 's an alarming disconnect between the public and the natural areas that allow us to be here in the first place so we use what we see to teach us what we know now the majority of us aren 't going to willingly go way down to a swamp can we still expect those same people to then advocate on behalf of their protection we can 't and to hopefully ultimately get them i still see the world through the eyes of a child and i try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of curiosity into my photography as often as can and we 're pretty lucky because here in the south we 're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences it 's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us because when i was a kid these were the types of images that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore dared me to go find the woods and put my head underwater and see what we have and folks i 've been photographing all over the world and i promise you what we have here in the south what we have in the and i have nothing against disney or mickey i used to go there too compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky they 're full of evil spirits and ghosts i don 't know where they came up with that idea but it 's actually led to a very real and ultimately our environment at risk because they have very little monetary these aren 't the most cuddly of ambassadors so it became assumed then that the only good swamp was a drained swamp and in fact draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation watersheds and flyways take this bird for example they nest and they mate and they breed in these old growth swamps in these flooded forests and so after the spring after they raise their young they then fly thousand of miles over the gulf of mexico into central and south america and then after the winter the spring rolls around and and they come back they fly thousands of miles over the gulf of mexico and where do they go where do they land right back in the same tree that 's nuts this is a bird the size of a tennis ball and this is my hometown laughter it 's crazy and it comes back to this golf course they still have a bad name i can understand that but what i loved about growing up in the sunshine state is that for so many of us we live with this there might be something much more ancient and much more adapted than we are knowing that you 're not top dog is how often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable and i viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles all these discomforts as affirmations that i 'd found true wilderness and i embrace them wholly now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater it 's only fitting that i 'd eventually end up in the most famous swamp of all the everglades growing up here in north central florida it always had these enchanted names places like hopefully reintroduce the everglades in a new light in a more inspired light but it 's an and then as the rains would fall in the summer these downpours would flow into lake okeechobee and lake okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward ever slowly so no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from polluted water or insufficient and unfortunately that 's precisely what we 've done we have drained we have dammed we have dredged the everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today the story of the everglades is is and while i have your attention i can tell you the real story it 's that we 're taking this and we 're trading it for this at an alarming rate because the everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for seven million floridians and it 's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer that built ironically today it 's also responsible for the over half a million acres of the endless river of sugarcane and i wanted that story to start in lake okeechobee and to do that i picked an ambassador an iconic species this is the everglade snail kite and why is that ping pong ball an aquatic so as we started damming up the everglades as we started diking lake okeechobee and draining the wetlands we lost the habitat for the snail and thus the population of the kites declined but i also wanted a photo that would communicate how how incredible this relationship was and how very important it is that they 've come to depend on each other this healthy wetland and this bird and to do that i brainstormed this idea i started sketching out these and i spent months planning this crazy and i took this platform down to lake okeechobee and i spent over a week in the water wading shifts from dawn until dusk to get one image that i thought might communicate this and here 's the day that it finally worked [ video after setting up the platform i look off and i see a kite coming over the but what the idea was is that for someone who 's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it these so important now i know i can 't come here to gainesville and talk to you about animals in the everglades without talking about gators i love gators i grew up loving gators they 're feared they 're hated and they are tragically because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season they start excavating these holes called gator holes and they do this because as the water drops down they 'll be able to stay wet and they 'll be able so how do you make an apex predator an ancient reptile at once look like it dominates the system but at the same time look vulnerable well you wade into a pit of about one hundred and twenty of them then you hope that you 've made the but i understand i know i 'm not going to rally you guys i 'm not going to rally the troops to save the everglades for the gators it won 't happen because they 're so ubiquitous we see them now they 're one of the great conservation success stories of the us but there is one species in the everglades that no matter who you are you can 't help but love too and that 's the roseate and at the turn of the 20th century they got down to two and why that 's because women thought they looked better on their hats then they did flying in the sky then we banned the plume trade and their numbers started and what they found out is that these birds ' behavior is intrinsically tied to the annual draw down cycle of water in the everglades the thing that defines the everglades watershed and just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid 20th century shooting up to nine hundred one thousand one thousand one hundred one thousand two hundred just as that started happening we started draining the southern everglades and we stopped the real spoonbill story the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this so all these different and it 's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal but it 's up to us as citizens as residents as stewards to hold our elected officials to their promises what can you do to take your friends out take your kids out take your family out the swamp will change you i promise over the years we 've been so generous with these other landscapes around the country cloaking them with this american pride grand canyon yosemite yellowstone and sadly the everglades is very commonly because maybe we 're finally starting to come around it 's a wetland of international importance and we 've come a long way in the last sixty years because if we can heal this system it 's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world but it 's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to they say that the everglades is our greatest test we get to keep the planet i"
