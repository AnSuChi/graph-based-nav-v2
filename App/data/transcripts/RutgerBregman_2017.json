  "transcript": "smoke more exercise less drink more and eat less healthfully why and she called poverty a personality defect but the idea idea that there 's something wrong with the poor themselves is not restricted to mrs thatcher some of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible but the underlying assumption is the same there 's if we could just change them if we could just teach them how to live their lives if they would only listen and to be honest this was what i thought it was only a few years ago that i discovered that everything i thought i knew about poverty was wrong it all started when i accidentally stumbled upon a paper by a few american psychologists they had traveled eight thousand miles all the way to india and it was an experiment with sugarcane farmers this means that they 're relatively poor one part of the year and rich the other the researchers what they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind the farmers scored much worse on the test to give you an idea that 's comparable to losing a night 's sleep or the effects of alcoholism i heard that eldar shafir a professor at princeton university and one of the authors of this study was coming over to holland where i live and i can sum it up in just two words and what that thing is doesn 't much matter whether it 's not enough time money or food you all know this feeling when you 've got too much to do or when you 've put off breaking for lunch and your blood sugar takes a dive this narrows your focus to your immediate lack so the goes out the window you could compare it to a new computer eventually it freezes not because it 's a bad computer but because it has too much to do at once the poor but because so suddenly i understood why so many of our anti poverty programs don 't work investments in education for example are often completely ineffective poverty is not a lack of knowledge a recent analysis of two hundred and one studies on the effectiveness of training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all now don 't get me wrong but it 's not enough or as professor shafir told me it 's like teaching someone to swim and then throwing them in a stormy sea i still remember sitting there perplexed and it struck me that we could have figured this all out decades ago i mean these psychologists didn 't need any complicated brain scans they only had to measure the farmer 's iq and iq tests were invented more than one hundred years ago actually i realized i had read about the psychology of poverty before george orwell one of the greatest how people take it for granted they have the right to preach at you and pray over you as soon as your income falls below a certain level now those words are every bit as resonant the big question is of course what can be modern economists have a few solutions up their sleeves we could help the poor with their paperwork or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills they cost next to nothing but ignore the so i wonder why don 't we just change the context or going back to our computer analogy why keep tinkering around with the software when we can easily solve the problem by installing some extra memory instead at that point professor shafir responded with a blank look and after a few seconds he said i get it you mean you you want to just hand out more money to the poor to eradicate poverty uh sure that 'd be great but i 'm afraid that brand of left wing politics you 've got in amsterdam it doesn 't exist in the states but is this really martin luther king to the economist and it 's an incredibly simple idea basic income guarantee shelter education it 's completely unconditional so no one 's going to tell you what you have to do for it and no one 's going to tell you what you have to do with it the basic income is not a is this the idea we 've all been waiting for could it really be that simple and it didn 't take long before i stumbled upon a story of a town that had done it had actually eradicated poverty canada at the start of the experiment an army of but then a new government was voted into power and the new canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment so when it became clear there was no money left to analyze the results the researchers decided to pack their files away in some two thousand boxes twenty five went by and no matter what she tried the results were the same every time the experiment had been a resounding success evelyn forget discovered that the people in dauphin had not only become richer but also smarter and healthier the school performance of kids improved substantially the hospitalization rate decreased by as much as eight point five percent and people didn 't quit their jobs the only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students similar results have since been found in countless other experiments around the globe from the us to india so here 's what i 've learned we the rich should stop pretending we know best we should stop sending shoes and teddy bears to the poor to people we have never met and we should get rid of the vast industry of paternalistic bureaucrats when we could simply hand over their salaries to the poor they 're supposed to help i mean the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self appointed experts think they need just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers like george orwell are now withering away in i believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people and we we can 't afford not to do it because poverty is hugely expensive higher dropout rates and more crime but let 's talk about the elephant in the room how could we ever afford a basic income guarantee well it 's actually a lot cheaper than you may think and in that scenario to our economists ' best estimates for a net cost of one hundred and seventy five billion a quarter of us military spending one percent of gdp you could actually that should be our goal the time for small thoughts and little nudges is it will not only free the poor but also the rest of us millions of people feel that their jobs have little meaning or significance a recent poll among two hundred and thirty thousand employees in one hundred and forty two countries found that only thirteen percent of workers actually like their job and another poll found that as much as thirty seven percent of british workers have a job that they think doesn 't even need to exist it 's like brad pitt says in fight club too often we 're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don 't need i 'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen and the care workers here if they stopped working we 'd be in trouble transactor peer to peer meetings while brainstorming the value add on of disruptive co creation in the network society or something like that just imagine again how much talent we 're wasting simply because we tell our kids they 'll have to earn a living or think of what a math whiz working at facebook lamented a few years ago the best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads i 'm a historian and if history teaches it is that things could be different ideas can and do change the world i know that many of you may feel pessimistic about a future of rising inequality xenophobia and climate change but it 's not enough to know we 're against we also need to be for something martin luther king didn 't say i have a nightmare he had a dream so i believe in a future where the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job but for a life well lived so here we are more than five hundred we all need to change our worldview because poverty is not a lack of character poverty is a lack of cash"
