  "transcript": "you have a strange career because i started my career as a theoretical nuclear physicist and i was thinking about quarks and gluons and heavy ion collisions and i was only fourteen years old no no i wasn 't fourteen years old but after that i actually had my own lab in the computational neuroscience department and i wasn 't doing any neuroscience later i would work on evolutionary genetics and i would work on systems biology i 'm going to tell you about something else today i 'm going to tell you about how i learned i wasn 't really a rocket scientist but i was working at the jet it was an exciting experience one day a nasa manager comes into my office sits down and says can you please tell us how do we look for life outside earth yet i had a very good answer i said i have no idea court like definition of life and then i thought about it a little bit is it really that easy because yes if you see something like this then all right fine i 'm going to call it life no doubt about it but here 's something and he goes it grows up into the adult stage like that and a benjamin button phase and actually goes backwards and backwards until it 's like a little and then you see something like that and he was like my god what kind of a life form is that anyone know it 's it 's a crystal so once you start looking and looking at smaller and smaller things so this particular person wrote a whole article and said hey these are bacteria except if you look a little bit closer most people aren 't it 's heavily disputed so can life be defined well how would you go about it well of course you 'd go to encyclopedia britannica and open at anything that actually refers to things that we are used to you throw away and then you might come up with something like this and it says something complicated with lots and lots of concepts who on earth would write something as 's actually a really really important set of concepts so i 'm highlighting just a few words and saying definitions like that rely on things that are not based on amino acids or leaves or anything that we are used to but in fact on processes only and if you take a look at that this was actually in a book that i wrote that deals with artificial life and that explains why that nasa and so if you go and ask yourself what on earth is artificial life and it started out but the interesting thing about these computer and the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we 're used to at least on the viral level in fact they have hackers writing when a scientist working at the santa fe institute decided why don 't we try to package these little viruses in and he more and of course since i really don 't know how to write code i had help in this i had two undergraduate students at california institute of technology that worked with me that 's charles ofria on the left titus but what you see here is some of the entrails but what i wanted to focus on is this type of population structure there 's about ten thousand programs sitting here and all different strains are colored in different colors and as you see here there are groups that are growing on top of each other because they are spreading any time there a program that 's better at surviving in this world due to whatever mutation it has acquired it is going to spread over the others and drive the others to extinction and we write our own stuff replicate it and are very proud of ourselves and we put them in and what you see immediately is that there are waves and waves of innovation by the way this is highly accelerated so it 's like a one thousand generations a second but immediately the system goes like what kind of dumb piece of code was this this can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly so you see waves of new types taking over the other types and this type of activity goes on for quite a while until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs and then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation like this one which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved and this process goes on and on and on people had asked me really was do these guys have a biosignature can we measure this type of life because if we can maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being biased by things like amino acids perhaps we should construct a biosignature based on life as a universal process in fact it should perhaps make use of the concepts that i developed just in order to sort of capture what a simple living system might be and the thing i came up with i have to first give you as opposed to text that is in our books and i would like to do it in such a way that i don 't actually have to be able to read the language because i 'm sure i won 't be able to as long as i know that there 's some sort of alphabet so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the twenty six letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys and if i look at french texts it looks a little bit different or italian or german they all have their own type of it doesn 't matter whether it 's a and it 's very stable as long as our books are written in english because people are rewriting them and recopying them so that inspired me to think about well what if i try to use this idea in order not to detect random texts from texts with meaning but rather but first i have to ask what are these building blocks like the alphabet elements that i showed you well we could use nucleic acids carboxylic acids fatty acids in fact chemistry 's extremely rich and our body uses a lot of them so that we actually to test this idea first took a look at amino acids and some other carboxylic acids and here 's the result what you get if you for example look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or in fact in a laboratory where you made very sure that in your primordial soup there is no living stuff in there what you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there 's some trace elements of other ones that is also very robust what you find but suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers because there 's bacteria all over you take water anywhere on earth because it 's teaming with life and you make the same analysis the spectrum looks completely different so this also turns out to be extremely robust it doesn 't matter what kind of sediment you 're using to grind up whether it 's bacteria or any other plants or animals what about these avidians the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity they have about twenty eight of these instructions and if you have a system where they 're being replaced so they are either poisonous or really should be used at less of a level than random in this case it doesn and i have to explain to you the top of this graph shows you that frequency distribution and i 'm starting this at a mutation rate that is so high that even if you would drop a replicating program that would otherwise happily grow up to fill the entire so there is no life possible at that type of mutation rate but then i 'm going to slowly turn down the heat so to speak and then there 's this viability threshold where now it would be possible and indeed we 're going to be dropping these guys into that soup too hot and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and in fact stabilizes and now what i did there is i was being nasty i just turned up the heat again and again and of course it reaches the viability threshold and i 'm just showing this to you again because it 's so nice you hit the viability threshold the distribution changes to self reproduce you cannot what do we learn from that well i think we learn a number of things from that one of them is if we are able to think about life in abstract terms and we 're not talking about things like plants and we 're not talking about amino acids and we 're not talking about bacteria but we think in terms of processes then we could start to think about life not as something that is so special to earth but that in fact could exist anywhere because it really only has to do with these concepts of information of storing information within physical substrates anything bits nucleic acids anything that 's an alphabet and make sure that there 's some process so that this information can be stored for much longer than you would expect then you have life first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear as far as the type of life on earth is and that in a sense removes us again but we have learned what it takes if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate then we can go and then look for large deviations from this this thing sticking but we could say well at least i 'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from and that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it and so that 's really the only take home message that i have for you life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other and i 'm going to leave you with that and thank you very much"
