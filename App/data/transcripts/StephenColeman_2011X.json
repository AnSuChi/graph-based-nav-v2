  "transcript": "what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world united states the uk and so on face in some of the deployments that they 're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things we 've sent australian military and a lot of these deployments that we 're sending military personnel to these days aren 't we 're asking military personnel to do in those situations are ones that in their own countries australia the us and so on would actually be done by police officers so there 's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they 're doing things they haven 't really been trained for and they 're doing things that if australia had to send but they aren 't trained the same way police officers are and they 're certainly not equipped the way police officers are so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these issues one particular thing that 's come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when we 're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the nonlethal weapons that police have since they 're doing some of the same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and there 's a range of places you 'd think those things would be really useful for example when you 've got military checkpoints is something hidden under their clothes what 's person is hostile or not if the person doesn 't follow directions they may end up shooting them so if they had nonlethal weapons then they would say we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn 't hostile at least we haven 't killed them another situation this photo is from one of the missions in the balkans in the late but if they respond there 's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt it 'd with access to nonlethal weapons if we 've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else at least we 're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we 're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they 're actually going to send robots out in the field that are autonomous they 'll make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without a human in the loop so the suggestion is if we 're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you 've got nonlethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones the large truck is called the active denial system something the us military is working on at the moment it 's essentially a big microwave transmitter it 's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way so you feel this massive heat and you go i want to get out of the way and they think this will be really useful in places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile need to keep people away from a particular place we can do that with these sorts of things and there 's a whole range of situations where they 're looking at them and saying these things would be really useful but as i said the military and the police are very have to look very hard at this to recognize that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they 're trained to use force is especially different the police and knowing because i 've actually helped to train police police particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained de escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort so they 're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and i think it 's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of nonlethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we 've already had so many problems with police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways i thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things and relate it to the military context i was very surprised when i started to do this to see people who advocated the use of nonlethal weapons by the military hadn 't actually done that they generally seemed to think why would we care what 's happened with the police we they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so i started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons when they 're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and being australian i started looking at stuff in australia knowing from my own experience of various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in australia one of the things i particularly looked at was the use of oc spray oleoresin capsicum spray pepper spray by and one study that i found a particularly interesting one was in queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly when they introduced oc spray in queensland they were really explicit the police minister 's and a heap of public statements were made about it they were saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting this is something they can use instead of a firearm in situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so i looked at all of the police shooting figures and you can 't actually find them very easily for individual australian states i could only find these this is from an australian institute of criminology report you can see in the fine print at the top police shooting deaths means not just people shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but these are the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where queensland said yes this is where we 're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to oc spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years that spike was all victoria so it wasn 't that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on fairly consistently over the years before the next two years were the years they studied two thousand and one two thousand and two anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they 've introduced this the number of times police in queensland used oc spray in that period three a thousand is getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting i 'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if queensland police didn 't have oc spray they wouldn 't have shot two thousand two hundred and twenty six people in those two years laughter in fact if you have a look at the studies they were looking at the material they were collecting and and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about fifteen percent of cases where oc spray was used it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it not within the context of this study anyway and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively noncompliant this person is not doing anything violent but they just won 't do what we want them to they 're not obeying the directions we 're giving them so that 'll speed them up everything will work out better that now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of nonlethal weapons and people might be some problems there 's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of force is that you have to be discriminate you have to be careful about who you 're shooting at one particular instance where i think that actually happens and the russian military police and it turned out that lots of the hostages died as a result of inhaling the gas and it 's no surprise that people died because you don 't know how much gas each person is to inhale what position they 'll fall in when they become unconscious and so on there were in fact only a couple of people who got shot so when they had a look at it afterward there were only a couple of people who 'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or by the virtually everybody that got killed got killed the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it 's certainly a few more than that because other people so this was one problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately a second problem people sometimes talk about with military use of nonlethal weapons and it 's actually why in the chemical weapons convention it 's very clear that you can 't use riot control agents as weapons of warfare that it 's seen that sometimes nonlethal weapons might be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a lethal force multiplier that you use nonlethal weapons first so your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody so this nonlethal weapon was being used in this case as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation another problem i want to quickly mention is that there 's a whole heap of problems with the way people are actually taught to use nonlethal weapons and get trained about them and then safe environments and are taught to use them in nice safe environments like this where but they 're never used like that they 're used out in the real world like in texas like this [ police taser great grandmother during traffic stop ] i confess this particular case one that piqued my interest in this it happened while i was working as a research fellow at the us naval academy he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well i 'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car i 'm going to tase you and she says oh go ahead and it 's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so she 's seventy two and it 's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her and there are other examples of the same sorts of things where you think is this really an appropriate way to use nonlethal weapons police chief fires taser into fourteen year old girl 's head she was running away what else was i suppose to do or florida just i checked the reports on this one i looked at it i was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed i kid you not that 's exactly what it said she took up a more threatening position in her bed but i 'd remind you i 'm talking about military uses of nonlethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force than the military are they 're trained to be more restrained in the use of force than so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it 's also going to be something that doesn 't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect nonlethal weapon is something that 's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they 'd had access to tasers or to a manned portable version of the active denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so i think thanks very much"
