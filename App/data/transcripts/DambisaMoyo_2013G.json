  "transcript": "give me liberty or give me death when patrick henry the governor of virginia said these words in one thousand seven hundred and seventy five he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with american generations to come at the time these but over the last two hundred years they 've come to embody what many westerners believe that freedom and that the best systems of politics and economics have freedom embedded in them who could blame them over the the combination of liberal democracy and private capitalism has helped to catapult the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development american ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation president obama said the question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom is unmatched thus there 's understandably a deep seated presumption among westerners that the whole world will decide to adopt private capitalism in the emerging markets this is an illusion and even though the universal declaration of human rights which was signed in was unanimously adopted what it did was to mask a schism that has emerged between developed and developing countries and the ideological beliefs between political and economic rights this schism has only grown many people who live in the emerging markets where ninety percent of the world 's population lives believe that the western obsession with political rights is beside the point shelter education and healthcare give me liberty or give me death is all well and good if you can afford it but if you 're living on less than one dollar a day you 're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family now i know many people in this room and around the world will think well actually this is hard to grasp what would you do if you had to what if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote over the last ten years i 've had the privilege to travel to over sixty countries and through these conversations it 's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there 's actually a split nor am i saying that they wouldn 't ideally like to pick their presidents or their leaders of course they would i am saying that on balance they worry more about where their living standard improvements are going to come from and how it is their governments can deliver for them the fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because and this is a system that is embodied by china instead of liberal democracy they have the democratic system and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights i put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time i will spend a few moments explaining to you first why economically they 've come to this belief first of all but it 's also in terms of living standards we see that in china twenty eight percent of people had secondary school access today it 's closer to eighty two percent second china has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct these two countries have the identical gini coefficient which is a measure of income equality whereas that of the united states has been declining thirdly this is not just about china building roads and ports and railways in her own country she 's been able to build eighty five thousand kilometers of road network in china and surpass that of the united states but even if you look to places like africa now this is something that people can see and point to when surveyed age old social problems that the world faces mexico city or mumbai you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions ladies and gentlemen it 's no surprise that around the world people are pointing at what china is doing and saying i like that i want that i want to be able to do what china 's doing that is the system that seems to work i 'm here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance in particular when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth in fact countries like not just china have shown that actually it 's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last if your per capita income is between two thousand and four thousand dollars then you 're likely to only get thirty three years of democracy and only if your per capita income is above six thousand dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water what this is telling us is that we need to first establish a middle class that is able to hold the government accountable but perhaps it 's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing freedom house finds that although fifty percent of the world what this says is that for people like me who care about liberal democracy is we 've got to find a more sustainable way of ensuring that we have a sustainable form of but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world something that is expected to happen by experts in two thousand and sixteen that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the west and the rest is likely to widen greater protectionisms of but also as i just pointed out a moment ago the question that is left for us in general is what then should the west be i suggest that they have two options the west can either compete but it also would be a natural stance for the west to take because in many ways it is the antithesis of the it will create a wider schism and by cooperating i mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way now i 'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking well this is like ceding to china but i put it to you and by that they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want the fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china instead of criticizing china for bad behavior the perhaps the west should take a leaf out of its own history book the supreme court justice stephen breyer reminds us that it took the united states nearly one hundred and seventy years from the time that the constitution was written for there to be equal rights in the united states some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights in fact there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law at its very best the western model speaks for itself it 's the model that put food on the but the fact of the matter is although people back in the day used to point at the western countries and say i want that i like that there 's now a new person in town in the form of a country china today generations are looking at china and saying china can produce infrastructure china can produce economic growth and we like that the question before us and the question before seven billion people on the planet is how can we create prosperity people who care and will pivot towards the model of politics and economics in a very rational way to those models that will ensure that they can have better living standards in the shortest period of time i would like to leave you and this is really about being creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people has to be based in being have good things and they have bad things i went into my annals of myself that 's a picture of me awww i was born and raised in zambia blacks were not issued birth certificates and that law only changed in one thousand nine hundred and seventy three this is an affidavit from the zambian government i bring this to you to tell you that in forty years i 've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious ted crowd today to talk to you about my views in this vein we can increase it 's going to require that we look at our assumptions assumptions and strictures that we 've grown up with thank you very much"
