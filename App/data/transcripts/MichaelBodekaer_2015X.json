  "transcript": "i am going to show you how this tablet and this and i 'm also going to show you how it can make any science teacher more than twice as but before i show you how all of this is possible let 's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important and with that growth comes a whole list of growing challenges challenges such as dealing with global warming well to a very last degree it is these young students this is the next generation of young bright scientists and in many and so a couple of years back my cofounder and i were teaching university students just like these only the students we were teaching looked a little bit more like this here and yes this is really the reality out there in way too many universities around the world students that are bored disengaged and sometimes not even sure why they 're learning about a topic in the first place but what we found was quite disappointing we saw that books were being turned into e books blackboards were being turned into youtube videos and lecture hall monologues were being turned into moocs massive and bringing it out to more students which is great don 't get me wrong that is really great but the teaching method is still more or less the same no where the students could perform experiments but not just simple simulations we would also create advanced simulations with top universities like mit to bring out cutting edge cancer research to these students dollars by letting the students perform virtual experiments before they go into the real laboratory and not only that now they could also understand even on a molecular level inside the machine what is happening to the machines and then they could suddenly perform dangerous experiments in the labs as well for instance also here learning about salmonella bacteria which is an important topic that many schools cannot teach for good safety reasons so they fully understand where the students are at so we brought in game designers to create fun and engaging stories for instance here in this case and the feedback we got when we launched all of this was quite overwhelmingly positive here we have three hundred students all passionately solving csi murder cases while learning core science skills and what i love the most about this is really when when the students come up to all surprised and a little confused and say i just spent two hours in this virtual lab and and i didn 't check facebook that 's how engaging and immersive this really is for the students and so to investigate whether this really worked a learning psychologist did a study with one hundred and sixty students that was from and what they did is split the students into two groups and they had the same amount of time then interestingly they gave the students a they could clearly measure the learning impact of the students and what they found was a surprisingly high but even more interestingly the second part of this study investigated what the teacher 's impact was on the learning and what they found was that when you combined the virtual then we saw a total one hundred and one percent increase in the learning effectiveness which effectively doubles the science teacher 's impact with the same amount of time spent so a couple of months back we started asking ourselves we have a wonderful team now of learning psychologists and teachers and scientists and and game developers and we started asking ourselves how can we keep ourselves to our promise i am really excited to be presenting what we came up with and have been working incredibly hard to create i will explain briefly what this is basically i take my and now what i can effectively do is i can literally step into this virtual world we 'll have some of you in the audience also get to try this because it is really something that you have to try to fully feel how immersive it really is it literally feels like i just stepped inside this virtual lab do you see me up on the screen audience yes michael bodekaer great awesome so basically i have just turned my mobile phone into a fully simulated million dollar ivy league laboratory with all this amazing look there i have my electron microscope i mean who 's carrying around an electron microscope in their pocket and here here i have my machine i can do different experiments on the machine and over here i have the door i can go into other experiments i can perform in the laboratories and here i have my learning tablet this is an intelligent tablet that allows me to read as you can see i can interact with it i can watch videos and see content that is relevant to the experiment that i 'm performing right now then over here i have marie she is my teacher my lab and very soon the teachers will be able to literally teleport themselves into this virtual world that i 'm in right now and help me guide me through this whole experiment before i finalize this i want to show you and what i just did so now it feels like i 'm standing inside the machine and i 'm seeing all the dna and i see the molecules i see and i can see how in this case dna is being replicated millions of times just like it 's happening inside your body right now and i can really feel and understand how all of this works now i hope that gives you a little bit of a sense of the possibilities in these new teaching methods i say that for a very important reason and so in many ways i believe that the next big quantum leap in science education lies no longer with the technology but rather with the teachers ' decision to push forward and adopt these technologies and so it is our hope that more universities and schools and teachers will collaborate with technology companies to realize this full potential and so and that is the story of jack andraka groundbreaking test for pancreatic cancer and when jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough he also because he was too inexperienced to be allowed in now imagine if we could bring ivy league virtual laboratories out to all these students just like jack all over the world and then imagine how"
