  "transcript": "my journey to become a polar specialist photographing specializing in the polar regions began when my family moved from southern canada to northern baffin island up by greenland there we lived with the inuit in the tiny inuit community of two hundred inuit radio we didn 't even have a telephone all of my time was spent outside with the inuit playing the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers and that 's where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it they 've never done this before but they 're allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that i 've just completed that is not published yet national and what these images are you 'll see them at the start of the slide show there 's only about four images but it 's of a little bear that lives in the great bear rainforest it 's pure white but it 's not a polar bear it 's a spirit bear or a kermode bear there are only two hundred of these bears left they 're more rare than the panda bear because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses and after two months of sitting there one day thinking that it was all over this incredible big white male came down right beside me three feet away from me and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it 400 year old culturally modified tree and went to sleep and i actually got to sleep just in the forest and photograph him so i 'm very excited to be able to please enjoy the the the show 's not over the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to ten and what does that mean after a while of reading this in the news it just becomes news you glaze over with it and what i 'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this and i want people megafauna species for me to hang my campaign on this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores there was no ice around but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it and this bear swam out to that and he was so he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as i approached him about twenty feet away to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal and as he as he ate and in the last four or five years we 're finding dead bears popping up all over the place we 're seeing them in the beaufort sea floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out i found a couple in norway last here 's a mother and her two year old cub were traveling they 're going to get to land but unfortunately ninety five percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem these ringed seals these are the fatsicles of the arctic these little and they 're not like the harbor seals that you have here these and what scientists didn 't predict is that as this ice melts these big pockets of black water are forming and they 're grabbing the sun 's energy and accelerating the melting process the visibility 's six hundred ft we 're on our safety lines the ice is moving all over the place i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but what 's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner in that one single piece of ice you have three hundred species of microorganisms and so really and i 've come up and all i wanted to do was get out of the water after an hour in these conditions i get to hand my camera and he thinks i 'm saying take my picture so we had this little communication breakdown but this picture right here means more to me than any other i 've ever made i dropped down in this ice and i was dizzy i thought i had vertigo i got very nervous no rope no safety line the whole world is moving around me and i thought giving birth and living out their entire the productivity in copepods go down this is a bowhead whale supposedly science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now this very whale right here could be over two hundred and fifty years old this whale could have been born around and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we 're leading in the south narwhals with their eight foot long ivory tusks don 't have to be here they could be out on the open water but they 're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes where they can breathe catch a breath because right under that ice are all the swarms of cod and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods i don 't think i 'll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals and tragically in [ two thousand and she was being consumed by a leopard seal and people were like we knew they were vicious we knew they were and so people love to form their opinions and that 's when i got a story idea i want to go to antarctica get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake find out if they really are these vicious animals or if they 're misunderstood so this is that story oh and they also happen to eat happy feet they 're also big they 're not these little harbor seals they are twelve ft floating in these icy waters and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon the boat starts to sink they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked so after five days of crossing the drake passage isn 't that beautiful and there 's this monstrous leopard seal and even in his voice he goes that 's a bloody big seal laughter and this seal starting hitting the hull of the boat and it 's time for you to get in the water and i looked at goran and i said to him forget that but i think i probably used a different word starting with the letter f and you can 't publish excuses dry mouth probably not as bad as now but i had such and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water and this was the first thing she did engulfed my whole camera and her teeth are up here and down here before i had gotten in the water had given me amazing advice he said if you get scared you close your eyes ya and she 'll go away so that 's all i had to work with at that point but i just started to shoot these pictures so she did this threat display for a few minutes and then the most amazing thing happened she totally relaxed she went off she got a penguin takes off she grabs another one she does this over and over and it dawned on me that she 's trying to feed me a penguin why else would she release these penguins at me and after she did this four or five times she swam by me with this dejected look on her face you don 't want to be too anthropomorphic but i swear that she looked at me like this useless predator 's going to starve in my ocean so realizing i couldn 't catch swimming penguins she 'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me bobbing like this and she 'd let them go this didn 't work i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding because i was crying underwater just because it was so amazing display sliding down this iceberg and then so she realized i couldn 't catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like are you for real because she can 't believe i can 't eat this penguin in her world you 're either breeding or you 're eating and i 'm not breeding so and she would get frustrated she 'd blow bubbles in my face she would i think let me know that i was going to starve but yet she didn 't stop she would not stop trying to feed me penguins what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me and she did that to threat display she chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me and i never once had a scary encounter they are the most remarkable animals i 've ever worked with and the same with polar bears and just like the polar bears these animals depend on an let 's go we 've got to get the story out now thank you very much"
