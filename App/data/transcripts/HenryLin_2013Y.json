  "transcript": "so most of the points that you see on the and as laboratories to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster it is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent it 's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster and in fact if you look very carefully you 'll be able to see rings around now to give you a number this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns it 's just mind boggling how massive these systems can get so if we like we can think of them as such as how does gravity work might be answered by studying these systems and i subtract away all of the starlight what i 'm left with is this big blue blob this is in false color what is emitting this light the answer is hot gas and the reason why it 's so hot goes back to the previous slide but science is a rough draft there are many basic and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot most of the universe 's matter is not made up of atoms you were lied to which we call dark matter and of course we would like to learn more about it if you 're a particle physicist you want to know what happens which is what happens when galaxy clusters collide what 's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge huge and this is very important because what it means is that very very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab might be compounded and compounded into something that we could possibly observe in nature so fourth thing the physics of the very strange i expect it to go up they give the cause and they call it dark energy and again we want to learn more about it here is a computer simulation and we need a way to simplify it the most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts similarly i can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies so well to answer they would have said faster horses they will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity and i can 't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us"
