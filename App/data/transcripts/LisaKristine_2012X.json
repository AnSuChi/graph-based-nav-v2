  "transcript": "i 'm one hundred and fifty feet down an illegal mine shaft in ghana and it 's hard to breathe but i can 't see much else and stone being broken with primitive tools i wear a flickering cheap flashlight tattered band i can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth when my hand slips i suddenly remember a miner i had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft as i stand talking to you today and often dying but they likely never will because they 're trapped in slavery and in two thousand and nine i had the great honor we started talking about slavery and really after we finished talking i felt so horrible and i i thought if i don 't know how many other people don 't know oddly i had been to many of these places before some i even considered like my i would see the skeletons hidden in the closet a conservative estimate tells us there are more than million people enslaved in the world today that 's double the amount of people taken from africa during the entire trans atlantic slave trade a hundred and fifty years ago an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an american worker entire families can be enslaved for generations astonishingly slavery generates profits of more than $ thirteen have been tricked by false promises of a good education a better job and they cannot walk away but the people producing them are disposable slavery exists and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world in india and nepal i was introduced to the brick kilns this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient egypt or dante 's inferno enveloped in temperatures of one hundred and thirty degrees men women children and carrying them from the scorching kilns deadened by monotony doing this task over and over for sixteen or seventeen hours a day and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working every twenty minutes i 'd have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it and as i sat there i thought my camera is getting far better treatment than these people back in the but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said lisa don 't do that just don 't do that here and he very clearly explained to me i could get them in a worse situation than they were already in i 'd have to rely on free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation and i trusted i 'd have to wait until i got home to really feel my heartbreak in the himalayas i found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain terrain and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth it 's difficult to witness something so they have nothing to compare it to the slaveholders burned down all of their houses and they do it in freedom and because of this worldwide awareness i was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dimly fluorescent lit basement along with young girls and boys some as young as seven years old are forced to entertain the clients encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol i remember and in that instant i could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell i had only one way out the stairs from where i 'd come in there were no windows large enough to climb through these people have no escape at all and as we take in such a difficult it 's important to note and the list can go on recently the new york times reported that between one hundred thousand and three hundred thousand american children are sold into sex slavery every year it 's all around us we just don 't see it the dyed black hands are the but the dye is toxic my interpreter told me their stories we have no freedom we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing it 's estimated that more than four thousand children the largest man made lake in the world i saw what seemed to be a and they 're forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake even though they do not know how to swim this young child is eight years old he was petrified he would be knocked in the water the skeletal tree limbs submerged in lake volta and weary frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines many of them drown for but they had been working since one i met him at a shelter where free the slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery here he 's seen taking a bath at the well pouring big buckets of water over his head kofi has been reunited with his family and what 's even better his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children kofi is the embodiment of possibility who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference driving down a road in ghana with partners of free the slaves a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window he told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle at the end then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath and said this is the path this is the path go and after about an hour of walking in found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring wading in water poisoned by mercury mercury is used in the extraction process these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of ghana bloodshot eyes for many of them had been underground for hours and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the but when we look closer we see some less fortunate illness and violence in fact it 's very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years this is manuru when his father died his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines when his manuru inherited his uncle 's debt which further forced him and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated on top of that yet he 's still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft even still he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like free the slaves and it 's this sort of determination in the face of unimaginable odds that fills me with complete awe i brought lots of candles with me i imparted to the people i was photographing that i wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight i made and that we will do whatever we can if we can see one another as fellow human beings then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities there is not a day that goes by that i don 't think of these many mistreated people i 've had the tremendous i hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them people like you for without that light thank you very much"
