  "transcript": "being a child and sort of crawling around the house i remember these turkish carpets and there were these scenes these battle scenes these love scenes i mean look this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this from this soldier and my mom took these pictures actually last week of our carpets and i remember this to this day there was another object this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity pretty scary stuff when you 're a little kid what i remember today from this is that objects tell stories so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work and then there was influence i was a teenager and at fifteen or sixteen i guess like all teenagers we want to just do what we love and what we believe in and so i fused together the two things i loved the most which was skiing and windsurfing those are pretty good escapes from the the drab weather in so created this compilation of the two i took my skis and i took a board and i put a mast foot in there and and here i was going really fast on frozen lakes and i realized then i had to go to design school and it was the early ' 90s when i finished and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley so i wanted to be there and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes that it had to change in order to to be with us and so i got myself a job and i was working for a consultancy and we would get in to these meetings and these managers would come in and they would say well what we 're going to do here is really important you know and they would give the projects code names you know mostly from star wars actually things like yoda luke i mean in retrospect probably stupid questions but things like what 's this caps lock key for 't really want to change the legacy stuff they didn 't want to change the insides they were really looking for us the designers to create the skins and i didn 't want to be a and then i saw this quote advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal so i had to start on my own so i moved to san francisco and i and i wanted to and so the first projects were sort of humble but they took technology and maybe made it into into things that people and it 's the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical and that allows me to check my timer discretely here without bending my elbow and other projects which were really about transformation about and then it folds into this is a light fixture for swarovski and what it does is it changes shape so it goes from a circle to a round to a square to a figure eight and just by drawing on a little this is a pretty involved process it took us about four and a half years but i really was looking for creating so we had to design both the light and the light bulb and that that 's a unique opportunity i would say in design and the new experience i was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm sort of glowing kind of mood light all the way to a bright work light so the light bulb actually does that it allows the person to switch and to mix these two colorations and it 's done in a very simple way one just touches the base and on the other the and i think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world whether it 's for business or as i 'm going to show on some civic type projects because i think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value value to but i think it 's the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater the greater value and the values we bring can be about environmental issues about sustainability about lower power consumption you they can be about business strategy but designers are really the glue and and by knowing when it is you 're talking it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about which is the the environmental noises but the other thing that is humanistic about jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the and all the nerdy stuff out of it and try to make it as beautiful as as we can i mean think about it the care we take in or accessories is is really and but how we work on jawbone is really unique i want to point at something here on the left putting tracers on the board anymore on a technology the designers are making small adjustments sketching drawing by hand and it 's what i call being design driven you know there is some push and pull but design is really design is never done all this other stuff the packaging and the website and you need to continue to really touch but how do you retain somebody when it 's never done really understands that the different structure is that we 're partners it 's a partnership and here 's another and it 's this guy from and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink or an organic drink for his kids to replace the sodas that he 's trying to get them away from and this allows the bottle to turn into a game the bottles connect together and you can create different shapes different forms thank you and then while we were doing this and then we thought well and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room the three dimensional design and then the other thing about this project is and it 's especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor when others can be creative and do more with it here 's another project which i think really is incredible in nigeria people carry their most precious belongings on their heads this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head i mean to me it just means so much but when nicholas negroponte and he has spoken about this project he wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology and those are pillars of his life but also pillars of the mission of of but the the third pillar that he that he talked wasn 't really working on computers i didn 't really want to from the previous adventure but what he said was was really significant is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product how we were going to make it low cost robust and plus he said he was going to get rid of the caps lock key and the num lock key and then the integration of all these great technologies which you 've heard about the wi fi antennas that allow the kids to connect the screen which you can read in sunlight the keyboard which is made out of rubber and it 's protected from the environment you know all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the olpc people and the engineers they fought the suppliers they fought projects like this one now you get these pictures you get up in the morning and you see the kids in nigeria and you see them in uruguay with their computers and in mongolia and we went away from obviously the beige i mean it 's colorful it 's fun in fact you can see each logo is is a little bit different it 's because we were able to to run during the manufacturing process twenty colors for the x and the o which is the name of the and by mixing them on on the manufacturing floor you get twenty times twenty you get four hundred different but this is my nephew anthony in switzerland and he had the laptop for for an afternoon and i had to take it back it was hard and there he is playing playing with his own version like paper paper and cardboard so i 'm going to finish with one one last project and this is a little bit more of adult play it 's the department of health and they needed a way to and you have to know where it is and i was just in new york at the launch and i went to see all these places where they 're installed this is at a puerto rican at a bar in christopher street at a pool hall clubs and discos too and here 's the public service announcement for this project this is really where design is able to create a conversation it was getting over a stigma and i think that 's also what design can do but i 'm not sure it 's the i have more you can always ask me for for some some more later and if anybody asks why you 're carrying a condom you can just say you like the design and it 's"
