  "transcript": "am going to speak about corruption but i would like to juxtapose two different things one is the large global economy the large globalized the other one is the small and very limited capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions because there is this which creates basically failing governance failing governance in many areas in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of in the area of climate change in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into in a worldwide arena and i think corruption and the fight against corruption and the impact of corruption is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for was undermining everything we were trying to do i began to not only try to protect but in general i thought a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption and as soon as i started this work from the legal department first in which they said you are not allowed to do this you are meddling in the internal affairs of our this is forbidden by the charter of the world bank so i want you to stop your doings in the meantime i was and many of them like to be in nairobi it is true it is one of the unsafest cities of the world but they like to be there because the other cities are even less and in these donor meetings i noticed that many of the worst projects which were put forward by our clients by the governments many of them representing suppliers from the north let me give you an example a huge power project three hundred million dollars to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable and one of the most beautiful areas of and we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits it had no clients nobody would buy the the electricity there nobody was interested in irrigation projects to the contrary we knew that this project would destroy the environment it would which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups the samburu and the turkana in this area so everybody knew this is a not a useless project this is an absolute damaging a terrible project and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools like hospitals and so on they took years you know you had too many studies and but these bad projects were absolutely damaging for the economy for many generations for the environment for thousands of families who had to be resettled they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks of supplier agencies of and so on and they came back very very quickly driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the north now these suppliers were our big companies they were the actors of this global market which i mentioned in the beginning coming from france from we are not talking about no we are talking about ten million twenty million dollars on the swiss bank accounts on the bank accounts of liechtenstein of the president and so i became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy making in these countries which the conflicts for the violence for the desperation in many of these countries that we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line that we have twice that number more than two billion people without sanitation and so on and the consequent illnesses of child mortality of more than ten million people every year children dying before they are five years old now why did the world bank not let me do this work after i left under a big fight the world bank in germany foreign bribery was allowed it was even tax deductible but also in france and the uk and scandinavia everywhere systematically bribed not all of and this is at the villa borsig we because we will which made it very difficult for an individual company an individual exporting country to say we are not going to continue this disastrous habit of large companies to bribe so this is what i mean with because even the powerful government which we have in germany comparatively was not able to say we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad many of them didn 't want to bribe many of the german companies for instance believe that they are really producing a but because the world was and this is why i 'm telling you this civil society rose we had this small ngo transparency international they began to think of and basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing and to make a long story short we managed to eventually get germany to sign together with the other oecd countries and a few other exporters in under the auspices of the oecd which obliged everybody to change their laws in doing this we had to sit together and we discussed with them in the first session we had three sessions over the course of two years and president von chaired one of the sessions the first one to take the fear away from the and in the first session they all said this is not bribery what we are doing this is customary there this is what these other cultures demand they even applaud it but in the second session they admitted already that they would never do this what they are doing in these other countries cabinet ministers would admit this and in the final and we had a longer term geographically much constituency we were trying to defend and that 's why the law has changed that 's why siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that 's why in some other countries the oecd convention is not yet properly enforced and again civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment in london for instance where the which the serious fraud office tried to prosecute one hundred million british pounds every year for ten years to one particular official of one particular friendly country they are not prosecuting in the uk why because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of great britain civil society is pushing civil society is trying to to get a solution to this problem we are germany is not ratifying why because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies in germany we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe and the members of our parliament don 't want to change this and this is why they can 't sign the u n convention against foreign bribery one of they very very few let me just try to i believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance by now the united nations is totally on our side the world bank has turned from saulus to paulus under wolfensohn they became i would say the strongest anti corruption agency in the world most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on and this is possible because society joined and then later in the monitoring of reforms if civil society organizations want to play that role they have to grow into this responsibility not all civil society organizations are good they have to have a much more transparent financial governance they have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in germany and continental europe in general do not focus enough yet but what i 'm saying from my very practical civil society does it right and and joins the other actors in particular governments governments and their international institutions but also large international actors in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility then in this magical triangle between civil society government and private sector there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better"
