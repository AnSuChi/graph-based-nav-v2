  "transcript": "designers extract principles processes and materials that are forming the very basis of design synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials to computational methods that emulate neural processes nature is driving design designers are growing novel technologies not foreseen or today i will tell human stories of bionic integration how and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability between human limitation and human potential bionics has defined my physicality in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite incurred during a mountain climbing accident at i reasoned that a human being can never be to advance technology i began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return to the vertical world any function a blank slate i made my height adjustable i could be as short as five feet or as tall as i 'd like so when i was feeling insecure i would jack my height up but when i was feeling confident and suave i would knock my height down a notch just to give the competition a chance applause narrow edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures where the human foot cannot penetrate and spiked i returned to my sport stronger and better technology had eliminated my disability and allowed me a new climbing prowess as a young man i imagined a future world where technology so advanced could rid the world of disability a world in which neural implants would allow the visually impaired to see sadly because of deficiencies in technology disability is rampant in the world this gentleman is missing three limbs he is out of the wheelchair but we need to do a better job in bionics to allow one day full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury at the mit media lab we 've established the center for extreme bionics the mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans across a broad range 'm going to tell you how my legs function how they work as a case in point for this center now i made sure to shave my legs last night because i knew i 'd be showing them off bionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces there 's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs mechanical how my limbs are attached to my it 's extraordinary to me that in this day and age one of the most mature oldest technologies in the human timeline the this is the beautifully lyrical design work of professor neri oxman at the mit media lab showing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances shown here by color variation in this model imagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it when you need it for optimal support and flexibility without ever causing discomfort my bionic limbs are attached to my biological body via synthetic skins with stiffness variations to look inside my body to figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues we also took robotic tools here 's a the actuators come in find the surface of the limb measure its unloaded shape and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point we combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description of my and we 've discovered optimality is where the body is stiff the synthetic skin should be soft where the body is soft the synthetic skin is stiff and this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances with clearly in the future our clothing our shoes our braces our prostheses will no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies but rather data driven quantitative frameworks in that future california the material is compliant it 's floppy like paper then the button 's pushed a voltage is applied and it becomes stiff as a board into the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb to my biological body when i walk here it 's no voltage my interface is soft and compliant the button 's pushed voltage is applied and it stiffens offering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb we 're also building exoskeletons this exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas of the running cycle to protect the biological dynamic interface how do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone what are the muscles and how are they controlled by the spinal cord this basic science motivates what we build we 're building bionic ankles knees and hips we 're building body parts from the ground up the bionic limbs that i 'm wearing four hundred of which have been wounded u s soldiers how does it work at heel strike under computer control the system controls stiffness to attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground then at mid stance the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers to lift the person into the walking stride comparable to how muscles work in the calf region something everyone should be able to do go up and down their steps at home bionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats here 's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway this is steve martin not the comedian who lost his legs in a bomb blast in afghanistan we 're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles that wrap around this gentleman does not have so these exoskeletons are applying this is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking it it 's so profound in its augmentation that when a normal healthy person wears the device for forty minutes and then takes it off we 're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies will make us stronger and faster and more efficient moving on to electrical interface how do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system this diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled and we 've discovered what reflexes so when i relax my muscles in my and that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command feels great we want to go a step further we want to actually close the loop between the human and the bionic external limb we 're doing through channels or micro channel arrays on the other side of the channel the nerve then attaches to cells skin cells and muscle cells then [ sensory information ] on the bionic limb can be converted to persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move like mallette shortly after being fitted with bionics is making a profound difference in people 's lives next week i 'm visiting the center for medicare and medicaid services and i 'm going to try to convince cms to grant appropriate code language and pricing so this technology can be made available to the patients that need it thank you it 's not well appreciated but over half of the world 's population suffers from some form sensory or motor condition and because of poor technology too often conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose the right to live life without severe depression the right to see a loved in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled our built environment our technologies are broken and disabled we the people need not accept our limitations indeed through fundamental advances in bionics in this century and we will end disability i 'd the story of adrianne lost her left leg in the boston terrorist attack it is her expression it is her art form naturally i 'm an mit professor i have resources 's build her a bionic limb to enable her to go back to her life of dance i and we studied how they move what forces they apply on the dance floor bionics is not only about making people stronger and faster our expression our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics it was three point five seconds in three point five seconds the criminals and cowards in two hundred days we put her back we will not be intimidated brought down diminished conquered or stopped by acts of violence she 's dancing with christian lightner elliott and nathan"
