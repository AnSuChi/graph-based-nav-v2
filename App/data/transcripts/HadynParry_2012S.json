  "transcript": "by focusing on the world 's most dangerous animal but of course the most dangerous animal is the mosquito the mosquito has killed more humans than any other creature and you would think would you not that with all our science with all our advances in society with better towns better civilizations better and we wouldn 't have and we wouldn 't have a disease that was relatively unknown fifty years ago u k being infected every year other estimates put that number at roughly double that number of infections and dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally in the last fifty years the incidence of dengue has grown thirtyfold now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is for those who don 't know now let 's assume you go on holiday let 's assume you go to the caribbean or you might go to mexico you might go to latin america asia africa the far east it doesn 't really matter it 's the same mosquito and it 's the same disease you 're at risk you could develop and you could actually feel because that 's how you can feel now the odd thing is is that once you 've been bitten by this mosquito and you 've had this disease your body develops antibodies so if you 're bitten again with that strain it doesn 't affect you and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before you 're more susceptible you 're likely to get worse symptoms and you 're more likely to get the more severe forms so why is it spreading so fast and it 's spread round the in fact a single mosquito will only travel about two hundred yards in its entire life they don 't travel very far what they 're very good at doing is hitchhiking particularly the eggs they will lay their eggs in clear water any pool any puddle and if that clear water is near freight it 's near a port if it 's anywhere near transport those eggs will then get transported around the world and that 's what 's happened mankind has transported these eggs all the way around the world and these insects have infested over one hundred countries and there 's now two point five billion people living in countries where this mosquito resides to give you just a couple of examples how fast this has happened in the about a billion dollars now a year trying to get rid of it trying to control it just one one species of mosquito two days ago or yesterday i can 't remember which i saw a reuters report that said madeira had had their first cases of dengue about fifty two cases with about four hundred first got the insect in two thousand and five so the one thing you 'll find is that where the mosquito goes dengue will follow somewhere else we must be good at killing mosquitos i mean that can 't be very difficult well there 's two principle ways the first way is that you use larvicides you use chemicals you put them into water where they breed now in an urban environment that 's extraordinarily difficult you 've got to get your chemical into every puddle every birdbath every tree trunk it 's just not practical the second way you can do it trying to kill the insects as they fly around this is a picture of fogging and if it was any good we wouldn 't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn 't have this massive increase in having said that actually your best form of protection and my best form of protection is a long sleeve shirt and a little bit of deet to go with it so let 's and decide what we want well we clearly need something that is effective at reducing the mosquito population there point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there we want something that gets that population right the way down so it can 't get the disease transmission clearly the product you 've got has got to be safe to humans we are going to use it in and around humans it has to be safe we don 't want to do anything that you can 't undo we don 't want a lasting environmental impact we want something that 's relatively cheap low income but you don 't really want to get all the other insects some are quite beneficial some are important to your ecosystem this one 's not it 's invaded you but you don 't want to get all all of the insects you just want to get this one and most of the time you 'll find this insect lives in and around your home so this whatever we do has got to get to that insect it 's got to get into people 's houses into the bedrooms into the kitchens now there are two features of mosquito biology that really help us in this project and that is firstly males don 't bite it 's and the second is a phenomenon that males are very very good at finding females if there 's a male mosquito that you release and if there 's a female around that male will find the female so here 's a typical situation male meets female lots of offspring a single female will lay about up to one hundred eggs at a time up to about five hundred in her lifetime now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the and if you can put more i 'll call them sterile that and you will bring that population down and that 's exactly where we are the company itself oxitec we 've been working for the last ten years very much on a sort of similar development pathway that you 'd get with a pharmaceutical company so about ten years of internal and two more now in brazil well the result has been very good in about four months of release we 've brought that population of mosquitos about two thousand three thousand people that sort of size starting small we 've taken that mosquito so that that 's been what we 've seen in cayman it 's been what we 've seen in brazil and we 've got a production unit in oxford or just south of oxford where we actually produce these mosquitos we can produce them in a space a bit more than this red carpet i can produce about twenty million a week because it 's a coffee cup something the size of a coffee cup will hold about three million eggs so freight costs aren 't our biggest problem and for brazil where we 've been doing some trials the brazilian government themselves have now built their own mosquito factory far bigger than ours and we 'll use that for scaling up in brazil there you are we 've sent mosquito eggs we 've separated the males from the females the males have been put in little pots and the truck is going down the road and they are releasing males as they go it 's actually and then you go back and within a very short space of time you 're bringing that population right the way down we 've also done this in agriculture we 've got several different species of and i 'm hoping that soon we 'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back and i 've just got a few final thoughts which is that this is another way in which biology is now coming in to supplement chemistry in some of our societal advances in this area these biological approaches are coming in and when you think about genetic engineering we 've now got enzymes for industrial processing enzymes genetically engineered enzymes in food and i 'm in favor actually of course i am of particularly where the older technologies don 't work well or have become unacceptable and both techniques are both have a side which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously and give it it an advantage what we 're actually doing is taking the mosquito so for the mosquito it 's a dead end"
