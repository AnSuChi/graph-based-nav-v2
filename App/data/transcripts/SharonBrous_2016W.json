  "transcript": "a new mother and a young rabbi in the spring of two thousand and four and the world was in shambles maybe you remember every day we heard devastating reports from the war in iraq there were waves of terror rolling across the globe it seemed like humanity was spinning out of control and i felt this sense of urgency coursing through my body we were living through a time of tectonic shifts in what kind of world did we bring this child and what was i as a mother and a religious leader willing to do about it now throughout history people have committed horrible crimes and atrocities in the name of religion and as we entered the 21st century it was very clear that religious extremism was once again on the rise hostilities and religion related violence have been on the increase all over the world but we don 't even need the studies to prove it because i ask you how many of us are surprised today when we hear the stories of a bombing or a shooting when we later find out that the last word that was uttered before the trigger is pulled or the bomb is detonated is the name of god it barely raises an eyebrow today when we learn that yet another person has decided to show his love of god by taking the lives of god 's children antiabortion christian extremist walking into planned parenthood in colorado springs and murdering three people and even when the stigmatization of lgbt people racism islamophobia and and anti semitism this ought to concern deeply those of us who care about the future of religion we need to call this what it is a great failure of religion but the thing is this isn 't even the only challenge that religion faces today at the very same what i call religious routine ism this is when our institutions and our leaders are stuck in a paradigm that is rote and perfunctory devoid of life devoid of vision and devoid let me explain what i mean like this one of the great blessings of being a rabbi is standing under the chuppah under the wedding canopy with a couple and helping them proclaim publicly and make holy the love that they found for one another and maybe the experience of the sixth or seventh anniversary and if you 're lucky enough to make it sixteen or seventeen years if you 're like most people you probably wake up in the morning realizing that you forgot to make a reservation at your favorite restaurant and you forgot so much as a card and then you just hope and pray that your partner also forgot but the love affair is long dead that 's when we find ourselves in endless mindless repetitions of words that don 't mean anything to us rising and being seated because someone has asked us to holding onto jealously guarded doctrine engaging in perfunctory practice simply because that 's the way things have always been done across the board churches and synagogues and mosques are all complaining about how hard it is to maintain relevance and what they need to understand is that there is today a generation of people who are as disgusted by the violence of religious extremism as they are turned off by the lifelessness of religious routine ism given the crisis of these two concurrent trends in religious life about twelve or thirteen years ago i set out to try to determine if there was any way that i could reclaim the heart of my own jewish i started to wonder what if we could harness some of the great minds of our generation and think in a bold and robust and imaginative way again about what the next iteration of religious life would look like now we had no money no no space no game plan but we did have email so my friend melissa and i sat down and we wrote an email which we sent out to a few friends and colleagues it basically said this before you bail on religion why don 't we come together this friday night and see what we might make of our own jewish inheritance it turned out one hundred people came many people said that night that it was the first time that they had a meaningful religious experience and so i set out to do the only rational thing that someone would do in such a circumstance i quit my job and tried to build this audacious dream a reinvented rethought religious by the way who have set out to reclaim the heart of our traditions who firmly believe that now is the time for religion to be part of the solution we are going back into our sacred traditions and recognizing that all of our traditions contain the raw material to justify violence and extremism and also contain the raw material to justify compassion coexistence and kindness that when others choose to read our texts as directives for hate and vengeance we can choose to read those same texts as directives for love and for i have found now in communities as varied as jewish indie start ups on the coasts to a woman 's mosque to black churches in new york and in north carolina to a holy bus loaded with nuns that traverses this country with a message of justice and peace that there is a shared religious ethos that is now emerging in the form of revitalized religion in this country and while the theologies and the practices vary very much between these independent communities what we can see are some common consistent threads between them i 'm going to share with you four of those commitments now the first is wakefulness we live in a time today in which we have unprecedented access to within twelve hours twenty million people saw that image of aylan kurdi 's little body washed up on the turkish shore we are called to a certain kind of action and our job to keep our hearts and our eyes open and to recognize that it 's our responsibility to help put out the flames this is extremely difficult to do psychologists tell us that the more we learn about what 's and to insist that we do what we don 't want to do and see what we do not want to see because we know that social change only happens and hope is not an opiate hope may be the single greatest act of defiance against a politics of pessimism and against a culture because what hope does for us is it lifts us out of the container that holds us and constrains us from the outside and you can dream and think expansively again that they cannot control in you where i brought my little girl who is now thirteen and a few inches taller than me to hear my friend rev otis moss preach there had already been three thousand people shot between january and july in chicago we went into that church and heard rev moss preach and after he did stood up and began to sing i need you to survive and i realized in that moment that this is what religion is supposed to be about it 's supposed to be about giving people back a sense of purpose a sense of hope a sense that they and their dreams fundamentally matter in this world that tells them that they don 't matter at all the third principle is the principle of mightiness there 's a rabbinic tradition that we are to walk around with two slips of paper in our pockets one says i am but dust and ashes i can 't control everything and i cannot do this on my own i can protest i can be a part of this conversation we even now have a religious ritual a posture that holds the paradox between powerlessness and power in the jewish community the only time of year that we prostrate fully to the ground is during the high holy days it 's a sign of total submission when we get up off the ground we stand with our hands raised to the heavens and we say but i can do something in a world that conspires to make us believe that we are invisible and that we are impotent religious communities and religious ritual can remind us that for whatever amount of time we have here on this earth whatever gifts and blessings the fourth and final is interconnectedness a few years ago there was a man walking on the beach in alaska when he came across a soccer ball that had some japanese letters written on it he took a picture of it and posted it up on social media and a japanese teenager contacted him he had lost everything in the tsunami that devastated his country it 's so hard for us to remember how interconnected we all are as human beings let me tell you how this works i 'm not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police because my white looking jewish kids probably won 't ever get pulled over for the crime of driving while black well because emma lazarus was right we are all in this together mightiness and interconnectedness there is a burgeoning multifaith justice movement in this country that is staking a claim on a countertrend saying that religion can and must be a force for good in the world and we deserve more than the failed religion of routine ism it is time for religious leaders and religious communities to take the lead in the spiritual and cultural shift that this country and the world so desperately needs a shift toward love toward justice toward equality and toward dignity for all i believe that our children deserve no less than that"
