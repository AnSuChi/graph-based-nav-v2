  "transcript": "but few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it if indeed there was any human agency involved involved but i do have to be concerned with those things it 's my job i 'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape i 've got to take that slide off i can 't stand it nor can chris so my talk is about the connection between technology and design of type the technology has changed a number of times since i started work i 've had to survive those changes and try to understand their implications for what i do for design this slide is about the effect of the two k 's the one on your left my right bzier formula imposes on the right ancient it has that spark of life from the human hand that the machine or the program can never capture what a contrast both of these were made on a computer same software same the one yet the letters are different the letters are different because the designers are different that 's all such as sculpture or and it has a function but there is a bit more to it than that there 's the sort of aesthetic element what makes these two letters different from different interpretations by different designers what gives the work of some designers whatever this is from the mid ' 60s hot to cold this brought some benefits but also one particular drawback a spacing system that only provided eighteen discrete units for letters to be accommodated on quickly looking at the arithmetic i realized i could only actually make three of related design here you see them extra compressed and ultra compressed this rigid 18 unit system really boxed me in it kind of determined the proportions of the design so do you look at these and say poor matthew he had to submit to a and by god it shows in the results i hope not i would have one thousand clearly i could make more variants but would these three members of the family be i can tell you that this is not fine the question is does a constraint force a compromise by accepting a constraint are you working to a lower standard but it 's very the phone book i 'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia and the phone books as i said to be printed at tiny size on newsprint on very high speed rotary presses with ink that was kerosene and lampblack this is not a hospitable environment for so the challenge for me was to design type that performed as well as possible in these very i had to draw every character by hand on quadrille graph paper there were four weights of bell centennial but i learned a lot these letters look as though they 've been chewed by the dog or something or other but the missing pixels at the intersections of strokes or in the crotches are the result of my studying the effects of ink spread on cheap paper and reacting revising the font accordingly these strange artifacts are designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of scale and production process at the outset at & t had wanted to set the phone books in helvetica but as my friend erik spiekermann said in the helvetica movie if you 've seen that i had to disambiguate these forms of the figures as much as possible in bell centennial by sort of opening the shapes up as you can see in the bottom part of that slide so now we 're on to the vector technology there was an issue at that time with the size of the fonts it limited the number of fonts you could get on your typesetting system at any one time i did an analysis of the data and found that a typical serif face you see on the left needed nearly twice as much data as a sans serif in the middle the numbers at the bottom of the slide by the way they represent the amount of data needed to store each each of the fonts so the sans serif in the middle sans the serifs was much more economical so i went to the head of engineering with my numbers and i said proudly i have solved your problem oh he said what problem and i said well you know the problem of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on oh he we solved that problem last week we wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude you can have as many fonts on your system as you like i didn 't just throw my design away in a fit of pique i persevered had started as a technical exercise became screw that the simplified forms of charter plain spoken quality and unfussy spareness that we want to respond we want to be pushed into exploring something new so charter is a sort of parable for me really in the end there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of charter i had really misunderstood the technology did suggest something to me but it did not force my hand and i think this happens very often in the mid ' 90s i started talking to microsoft all the fonts on screen had been but microsoft foresaw correctly the the movement the stampede towards electronic communication so the priorities at that point they wanted a small core set of fonts that were not adapted but designed for the screen to face up to the problems of screen which were their coarse resolution displays i said to microsoft a typeface designed for a particular technology is a typeface i 've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems thanks to the engineers the so i was persuaded i was convinced and we went to work on what became for the first time working not on paper but directly onto the screen from the pixel up screens were binary the pixel was either on which is the thin black line the the bitmap is rasterized from the outline the two are in almost perfect sync on the cartesian grid o this looks more like this is a good bitmap o for the simple reason that it 's symmetrical in both x and y axes in a binary bitmap you actually can 't ask for more than that i would sometimes make i don 't know three or four different versions of a difficult letter like a lowercase a and then stand back to choose which was the best well there was no so the designer 's judgment comes in in trying to decide which is the least bad is that a compromise although that standard may be well short of the ideal you may be able to see on this slide two different bitmap fonts there the a in the upper one i think the lower one but it still ain 't great you can maybe see the effect better if it 's reduced well maybe not out of necessity for a certain kind of temperament there is a certain kind of satisfaction in doing something that cannot be perfect but can still be done to the best of your ability here 's the lowercase h from georgia italic the bitmap looks jagged and rough it is jagged and rough but i discovered by experiment that there is an optimum slant for an italic on a screen so the strokes break well at the pixel boundaries look in this example how rough as it is how the left and right legs actually break at the same level that 's a victory that 's and of course at the lower depths well it 's been eighteen years now since verdana and georgia were released microsoft were absolutely right it took a good ten years but screen displays now do have improved spatial resolution and very much improved photometric resolution thanks to anti aliasing and so on so now that their mission is accomplished has that meant the demise of the screen fonts that i designed for coarser displays back then will they outlive the now obsolete screens and the flood of new web fonts coming on to the market or have they established their own sort of evolutionary niche in other words have they been absorbed into the typographic mainstream i"
