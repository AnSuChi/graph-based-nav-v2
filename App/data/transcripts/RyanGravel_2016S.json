  "transcript": "this picture is from my metro card when i spent a year abroad in paris in college in the mid ' 90s my friend says i look like a french anarchist laughter but this is still what i see when i look in the mirror in the morning within a month of living in paris i 'd lost fifteen pounds and i was in the best shape of my life having grown up in suburban atlanta a region built largely by highways and automobiles and with a reputation as a poster child for sprawl and i got obsessed with the role of infrastructure but it 's the foundation for our economy it and it really matters to the way that we live when i came home i was instantly frustrated stuck in traffic as i crossed the top end of our perimeter highway i had no social interaction with the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me like me with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring i wondered if this was an inevitable outcome or could we do something about it was it possible to transform this condition in atlanta into the kind of place that i wanted to live in i went back to grad school but i went to work at an architecture firm and eventually talked to more people wanted to hear about it in the summer of two thousand and one the atlanta beltline a 22 mile loop of transit and trails and transformation i was doing two and three but found the atlanta beltline as something that they could fight for developers who saw the opportunity to take advantage of a lot of new growth in the city and dozens of nonprofit who saw their mission at least partly accomplished by the shared vision usually these groups of people aren 't at the same table wanting the same outcome but there we were and it was kind of weird but it was really really powerful the people of atlanta fell in love with a vision that was better than what they saw through their car windshields and i guarantee you we would not be building it otherwise from the beginning our coalition was diverse people of all stripes were part of our story people on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it too they were just afraid they weren 't going to be able to be there and we 've all heard that kind of story before right including significant subsidies for housing new parks art an arboretum and importantly and what our expectations are for living there because they didn 't want to get in the car they were can we at least ride our bikes and i said of course we can that 's what people in atlanta do we ride our bikes to the grocery and i also understand that their expectations for atlanta are really powerful the movement where our investment in highways and automobiles fundamentally changed changed american life that wasn 't some grand conspiracy there were conspiracies within it of course but it changed our expectations for our lives and it was and we got all the highways and strip malls and cul de sacs we wanted so it 's important to not separate the physical construction of the places we live from other things that are happening at that time at that time and the sexual revolution was breaking down barriers and the civil rights movement began its march toward the fulfillment of our nation 's promise entertainment food travel business everything was changing the federal highway administration for example didn 't exist before there were highways think about it of course today it 's important to understand and acknowledge that those benefits accrued to some groups of people and not to others we wonder if we 're stuck we stuck with the legacy of that inequity are we stuck with this dystopian traffic hellscape are we stuck with rampant urban displacement with environmental degradation are we stuck with social isolation or political polarization are these the inevitable and permanent outcomes and if they are can change them what i have learned from our experience in atlanta is not an anomaly similar stories are playing out everywhere where people are reclaiming not only old railroads but also degraded urban waterways and obsolete roadways reinventing all of the infrastructure in their lives hong kong singapore toronto and paris cities big and small all over the world are reclaiming and reinventing this infrastructure for themselves including the mother of all catalyst infrastructure projects and is now in the early stages life affirming infrastructure again water quality and flood control it 's already improving the lives of people it 's already changing the way the rest of us think about los angeles this is more than just infrastructure tech and design all of these things early indicators of a really radical shift in the way we build cities we 're taking places like this and transforming them into this and soon this and this is all exciting and good we and it is awesome i mean but our history of sprawl and from what we can already see with these catalyst projects today we know and must remember that big changes like this don 't usually benefit everyone the market forces unleashed by this cultural momentum prices and rents this is urgent if we care we have to stand up and speak out this should be a call to action because the answer can 't be to not improve communities the answer can 't be to build parks and transit and grocery stores the answer can 't be to hold communities down just to keep them affordable but we do have to follow through and address the financial realities that we 're facing and i 'm committed to this goal in atlanta to sticking up again for people who made it possible in the first place we can 't call it a success without them i certainly can 't because the people i made commitments to all those years weren 't abstract populations they 're my friends and neighbors they 're people that i love so even though it started as my graduate thesis and i 'm working hard for sixteen years with thousands of people to help make this thing come to life i know and believe that but locally and globally we have to understand this accountability to the people whose lives we are changing because this is us we are the lives we 're talking about these places aren 't inevitable the places we live aren 't inevitable we have to ensure that change comes on our terms and to do that we have to participate actively in the process of shaping change thank you"
