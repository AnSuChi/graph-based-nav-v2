  "transcript": "common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don and for the last decade or so it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means there have been some very vocal but that it 's ridiculous these people many of whom have lived in north oxford have argued they 've argued that believing in god is akin to believing in fairies now i think it 's too easy i think it 's too easy now what is atheism two point zero well it starts from a very basic premise there 's no god of course there are no deities or supernatural now let 's move on that 's not the end of the story that 's the very very beginning i 'm interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines that thinks i can 't believe in any of this stuff i can 't believe in the doctrines i don 't think these doctrines are right i really like i really like looking at old churches i really like turning the pages of the old testament whatever it may be you know the kind of thing i 'm talking about people who are attracted to the ritualistic side the moralistic communal side of religion but can 't bear the doctrine until now these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice it 's almost as though either you accept the doctrine then you can have all the nice stuff or you reject the doctrine and you 're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart i think there is an alternative i think there are ways and i 'm being both very respectful and completely impious of stealing from religions if you don 't believe in a religion there 's nothing wrong with picking and mixing with taking out the best sides of religion and a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well 'd like to run through a few of these today i 'd like to kick off by looking at education now education is a field the secular world really believes in it 's also going to make us better you know the kind of thing a commencement address is and graduation ceremonies those lyrical claims in the early 19th century church attendance in western europe started sliding down very very sharply and people panicked they asked themselves the following question they said where are people going to find the morality where are they going to find guidance and where are they to find sources of consolation in there we 'll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the gospel of saint john it 's also an idea that we have forgotten if you went to a top university let 's say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge and you said i 've come here because i 'm in search of morality guidance and consolation i want to know how to live they would show you the way to the insane asylum now religions start from a very different place indeed all religions all major religions at various points call us children maybe you and so we need guidance and we need didactic learning you know advising people how they could live he delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons now we 've given up with the idea of sermons if you said to a modern liberal individualist hey wants to change your life the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable because we are in need of guidance morality we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once they 'll remember it sit them in a classroom tell them about plato at the age of twenty so get on your us the new we 're always saying the new is better than the old if i said to you okay we 're not going to have new ted we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true we 're going to watch elizabeth gilbert five times the other things that religions do is to arrange time what is a calendar a calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas in the catholic chronology catholic calendar at the end of march you will think about st jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor you won 't do that by accident you will do that because you are guided to do that now we don 't think that way in the secular world we think if an idea is important i 'll bump into it i 'll just come across it says the religious world view religious view says we need calendars we need to structure time we need to synchronize encounters take the moon you think i 'm really small what are my problems it sets things into perspective why don 't we well there 's nothing to tell us look at the moon made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of you 'll be handed rice cakes and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart the other thing that religions are really aware of is speak well i 'm not doing a very good job of this here but oratory oratory is absolutely key to religions after every convincing point people will go amen amen amen at the end of a really rousing paragraph they 'll all stand up and they 'll go thank you jesus thank you christ thank you savior if we were doing it like they do it so they don 't just deliver us sermons on this they don 't just give us books or words about you immerse yourself in the water we don 't tend to do that our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two let 's look at art now now art is something that in the secular world we think very highly of we think art is really really important we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals or our new churches you 've heard that saying but we 've completely let ourselves down and the reason we 've let ourselves down is that we 're not properly studying how religions handle the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art the first idea is that art should be for art 's sake a ridiculous idea an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world i couldn 't disagree more if they said it it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy that 's why a very common feeling when you 're in a museum let 's admit it is i don 't know what this is about but if we 're serious people we don 't admit to that but that feeling of puzzlement is structural it 's trying to remind you of what there is to so as you walk around a church or a mosque or a cathedral rembrandt is a propagandist in the christian view now the word propaganda sets off alarm bells we think of hitler we think of stalin don 't necessarily propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something and if that thing is good there 's no problem with it at all my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions and they should make sure that when you walk into a museum if i was a museum curator i would make a room for love a room for generosity all works of art are talking to us about things and if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would get a lot more out of art art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we 've neglected because of certain mis founded ideas art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society art should be didactic the people in the modern world in the secular world who are interested in matters of the spirit in matters of the mind in higher they are vulnerable single people and they get depressed and they get sad on their own they form institutions and that has all sorts of advantages first of they 're collaborative we recognize them in relation to corporations they have no might so now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us but we can admire the institutional way in which they 're doing it and that 's what so they don 't get lost in a busy world that 's something we can learn from there are things for you in religion if you 're involved say in a travel industry in any way look at pilgrimage look very closely if you 're in the art world look at the example of what religions are doing with art you may not agree with the ideas but my goodness they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so thank you very much yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters ab you can get shot by both sides you can get shot by the hard headed atheists and you can get shot by those who fully believe ca incoming missiles from north oxford at any moment ab indeed ca but you left out one one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from which is this this sense that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious of spiritual experience of some kind of connection with something that 's bigger than you are is there any room for that experience in atheism two point i like many of you meet people who say things like but isn 't there something bigger than us something does that sense of mystery that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling science and just observation gives us that feeling without it so i don 't feel the need the universe is large and we are tiny without the need for further so one can have so called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit how many people here would say that religion is important to it 's not as though as i try to suggest it 's not as though either you have religion it 's so sad that we constantly say so i can 't go on a pilgrimage one wants to say nonsense why not atheism shouldn 't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion ca it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the community who are atheists but probably most people in the community certainly don 't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war that there could be bridging ab no we need to be polite about differences politeness is a but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says you move on because you 've agreed on ninety percent of things because you have a shared view on so many things and you politely differ and i think that 's what the religious wars of of late have ignored they 've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement ca does it need a leader and are you volunteering to be the pope it doesn 't need it but wherever you are as i say if you 're in the travel industry do that travel bit if you 're in the communal industry look at religion and do the communal bit so it"
