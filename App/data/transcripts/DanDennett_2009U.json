  "transcript": "and this is a passage that i just love and would like to read for you the theory with which we have to deal absolute ignorance is the artificer so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine it is not requisite to know how to make it this proposition will be found on careful examination to express in condensed the essential purport of the theory seems to think absolute ignorance fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in the achievements of creative skill exactly and it is a strange inversion a creationist pamphlet has yes no yes no if you answered ' yes ' give details but in some ways just as important it stands to reason that we love chocolate cake guys go for girls like this because they are sexy we adore babies because theyre so cute and of course we are amused by jokes this is all backwards lets start with sweet our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector and thats why we like sugar honey is sweet because we like it not like it because honey is sweet theres nothing intrinsically sweet about honey if you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind you wouldnt see why they tasted sweet you have to look in our brains to understand why theyre sweet and then we evolved to like sweetness youve got it backwards thats just wrong its the other way round sweetness was born with the wiring and its a good thing that there isnt because if there were then mother nature would have a problem how on earth do you get chimps to now you might think ah hallucinations that would be one way of doing it but theres a quicker way just wire the chimps up to love that look and apparently they do thats all there is to over six million years we and the chimps evolved our different ways we became oddly enough for one reason or another they didnt if we hadnt then probably this would be the height of sexiness tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high energy food it wasnt designed for chocolate cake chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus the term is owed to niko tinbergen who did his famous experiments with gulls where he found that that orange spot on the gulls beak if he made a bigger oranger spot the gull chicks would peck at it even harder it was a hyperstimulus for them they loved it what we see with say chocolate cake is its a supernormal stimulus to tweak and there 's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness heres a pretty good its important that we love babies and that we not be put off by say messy diapers and they do and by the way a recent study shows that mothers prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby but now if babies didnt look the way they do if babies looked like this thats what we would find adorable oh my goodness do i ever want to hug that my answer is its the same story the same story this is the hard one the one that isnt obvious thats why i leave it to the end and i wont be able to say too much about it but you have to think evolutionarily have to think what hard job that has to be done its dirty work somebodys got to do it is so important to give us such a powerful inbuilt reward for it when we succeed now i think we 've found the answer i and a few of my colleagues its a neural system thats wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging now im not going to have time to spell it all out but ill just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward and what were doing is were using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe now well turn a little bit more now its not funny in this way we can actually learn something about the architecture of the brain the functional architecture of the brain"
