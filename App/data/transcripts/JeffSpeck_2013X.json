  "transcript": "what is the walkable city well for want of a better definition it 's a city in which the car is an optional rather than a prosthetic device and i 'd like to talk about why we need the walkable city and i 'd like to talk about but and you can see it at ted com so today i want to talk about how to do it in a lot of time thinking about this i 've come and i 'd like to share what i think i 've figured out it 's grand rapids or cedar rapids or memphis in the typical american city in which most people own cars and the temptation is to drive them all the time if you 're going to get them to walk then you have to offer the walk has to be safe and feel safe the walk has to be comfortable and the walk has to be interesting and that 's the structure of my talk today to take you through each of those the reason to walk and i should say half the slides and half of my talk today it 's the story of planning the story of the formation of the planning profession when century people were and lifespans increased immediately so there 's the onset of what we call euclidean zoning the separation of the landscape into large areas of single and typically when i arrive in a city to do a plan because nothing is located near anything and this is a seurat it so this is the big story of the new urbanists to acknowledge that there are only two ways two ways that have been tested by the thousands to build communities in the world and you see here several neighborhoods of newburyport massachusetts recreate get educated all within walking distance and we contrast that to the other way an invention that happened after the second world war suburban sprawl clearly not compact and it 's not walkable because so few of the streets connect that those streets that do connect become so it 's fun to break public institutions schools get bigger and bigger and therefore further and further from each other and the ratio of the size of the parking lot to the size of the school tells you all you need to which is that no child has ever walked to this school no child will ever walk to this school the seniors and juniors are driving the freshmen and the sophomores and of course we have the crash statistics to prove it and then the civic institutions like playing fields it 's wonderful that westin in the ft lauderdale area has eight soccer fields and eight baseball diamonds and twenty tennis courts but look at the road that takes you to that location and would you let your child bike on it and this is why we have the soccer mom now when i was young i had one soccer field one baseball diamond and one tennis court but i could walk to it because it was in my neighborhood then the final part of sprawl that everyone forgot to count if you 're going to separate everything from everything else and reconnect it only with automotive infrastructure then this is what your landscape begins to to look like the main message here is if you want to have a walkable city you can 't start with the sprawl model you need the bones of an urban model this is the outcome of that form of design often to absurd extremes and being a driver can be a bit of a nuisance this is a slide that epidemiologists have been showing for some time now laughter the fact that we have a society where you drive to the parking lot to take the escalator to the treadmill shows that we 're doing something wrong but we know how to do it better here are the two models contrasted i show this slide which has been a formative document of the new urbanism now for almost thirty years rather than a cul de sac or a collector system of streets so when we look at a downtown area at a place that has a hope of being walkable and mostly that 's our downtowns in america 's cities and towns and villages we look at them and say we want the proper balance it is housing that is lacking the jobs to housing balance is off and you find that when you bring housing back these other things start to come back too and housing is usually first among those things and of course the thing that shows up last and eventually is the schools because schools get pretty good eventually the other part of this but perfectly walkable cities require transit because if you don 't have access to the whole city as a pedestrian then you get a but every transit and so we have to remember to build walkability around our transit stations famously 600 foot blocks if you look at the two it 's almost like two different planets but these places were both built by humans and in fact and that 's a problem these are the crash statistics when you double the block size this was a study of twenty four california cities when you double the block size you almost quadruple so how many lanes do we have this is where i 'm going to tell you what i tell every audience i meet which is demand applies both to highways and to city streets and induced demand tells us that when we widen the streets to accept the congestion that we 're anticipating or the additional trips that we 're anticipating in congested systems it is principally that congestion that is constraining demand and so that the widening and there are all of these latent trips that are ready to happen people move further from work and make other choices about when they commute and those lanes fill up very quickly with traffic so we widen the street again this is from newsweek magazine hardly an esoteric publication today 's engineers acknowledge that building new roads usually makes traffic worse my response to reading this was may i please meet some of these engineers because these are not the ones that i there are great exceptions that i 'm working with now but these are not the engineers one typically meets working in a city where they say oh that road is too crowded we need to add a lane so you add a lane and the traffic comes and they say see i told you we needed that lane when the mayor came running to me but it certainly is enough to make a mayor do something about it we did a walkability study and what look at these numbers they 're all near or under ten thousand cars and these were so you had a fundamental disconnect between the number of lanes and the number of cars that wanted to use them so it was my job and we 're rebuilding it now so a typical oversized street to to nowhere you know when you do that you find room for medians the typical city is more like cedar rapids where they have an all and it 's a little hard to see but what we 've done and it protects the sidewalk that parking makes the sidewalk safe then the the lanes themselves how wide are they that 's really important the standards have changed such that as andrs duany says the typical road to a subdivision in america allows you to see the curvature of the earth this is a subdivision outside of washington from the 1960s look very carefully at the width of the streets this is a subdivision from the when it was time to fix the street that wasn 't draining properly they had to widen it and take away half our sidewalk because the standards were wider but the citizens know it so that in birmingham michigan they fight for for narrower streets the developer vince in his project i 'on which we worked on in south carolina he goes to conferences and he shows his amazing 22 foot roads these are two way roads very narrow rights of way and he shows this well known philosopher who said broad is the road that leads to destruction narrow is the road that leads to revolution underway in only some american cities but where you build it they come as a planner i hate to say that but the one thing i can say is that bicycle population is a function of bicycle infrastructure i asked my friend tom brennan from nelson \\ nygaard in portland to send me some pictures of the portland bike commute he sent me this i said was that when you do what portland did and spend money on bicycle infrastructure new york city has doubled the number of bikers in it several times now by painting these bright green lanes even automotive cities like long beach california if you know 15th street here in the buffered lane the parallel parking pulled off the curb the bikes between and this is the only bicyclist that i met in pasadena so the parallel parking i mentioned it 's an essential barrier of steel that protects the curb and pedestrians from moving vehicles this is ft lauderdale one side of the street you can park the other side of the street you can 't this is happy hour on the parking side this is sad hour on the other side and then the trees themselves slow cars down they move slower when trees are next to the road and of course sometimes they slow down very quickly because this is objective journalism some say the entrance to citycenter is not inviting to pedestrians when every aspect of the landscape is swoopy is aerodynamic is stream form geometrics it says this is a vehicular place so no one detail no one speciality can be allowed to set the stage so then quickly the comfortable walk has to do but we also want to feel that our flanks are and so we 're drawn to places that have good edges and if you don 't supply the edges people won 't want to be there what 's the proper ratio of height to width is it one to one three to one if you get beyond one to six you 're not very comfortable anymore you don 't feel enclosed now six to one in salzburg can be perfectly delightful the opposite of salzburg is houston this was the zoning code that said i couldn 't build on that site as you may know washington dc is now changing its zoning to allow sites like this to become sites like this we needed a lot of variances to do that triangular houses can be interesting to build but if you get one built people generally like it and then finally the interesting walk signs of humanity we are among the social primates nothing interests us more than other people this is grand rapids a very walkable city but nobody walks on this street that connects the two best hotels if on the left you have an exposed parking deck and on the right you have a conference facility that was apparently designed in admiration for that parking deck then you don 't attract that many people mayor joe riley in his 10th term mayor of charleston south carolina taught us it only takes twenty five feet of building to hide two hundred and fifty feet of garage this one i call the chia pet garage i want to end with this project that i love to show it 's by in columbus ohio to the left it wasn 't doing very well because this was the bridge and no one was walking from the convention center into that neighborhood well when they rebuilt the highway they added an extra so find those places where you have most of them fix what you can fix what still needs fixing in those places i really appreciate your attention and thank thank you for for coming today"
