  "transcript": "and a nigerian journalist comes and this will only make sense if you 've ever watched a james bond movie and a nigerian journalist comes up to i 've got a little sheet of paper here mostly because i 'm nigerian and if you if you leave me alone i 'll talk for like two hours i just want to say good good afternoon good evening it 's been an incredible few days it 's downhill from now on i wanted to thank emeka and chris but also most importantly all the invisible people behind ted that you just see flitting around the whole place that have made sort of this this space for such a diverse and robust conversation it 's really amazing i and i 've been watching people with the slide shows and i 've been feeling a bit like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah what have i got to say about all this and i was watching jane [ goodall ] yesterday and i thought it was really great and i was watching those incredible slides of the of the chimpanzees and i thought wow what if a chimpanzee could talk you know what would it say my first thought was well you know there 's george bush but then i thought why be rude to chimpanzees i guess there goes my green card and what 's become increasingly clear to me is that we 're talking about news stories about africa we 're not really talking about african narratives and it 's important to make a distinction because if if the news is anything to go by forty percent of americans can 't either either can 't afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance and have a president who despite so if news is anything to go by everything we know about america everything americans come to know about being american isn 't from the news i live there we don 't go home at the end of the day i really know who i am now because the wall street journal says that the stock exchange closed at this many points what we know about how to be who we are comes from stories it comes from the novels the movies the fashion magazines it comes from popular culture in other words it 's the agents of our imagination who really shape who we are and this is important in africa the complicated questions we want to ask about what all of this means has been asked from the rock paintings of the san people through the sundiata epics of mali to modern contemporary literature if you want to know about africa read our literature and not just things fall apart because that would be like saying i 've read ' gone with the wind ' and so i know everything about america 's very important there 's a poem by jack gilbert called the forgotten dialect of the heart he says but what if they were poems and psalms my love is like twelve ethiopian goats standing in the morning light giraffes are this desire in the dark this is important it 's important because misreading is really the chance for complication and opportunity the first igbo bible was translated from english in about the 1800s by bishop crowther who was a yoruba and i 'm not going to give you the patois translation i 'm going to make it standard english basically it ends up as god is on a bicycle with his angels this is good because language complicates things you know we often think that language mirrors the world in which we live and i find that 's not true the language actually makes the world in which we live language is not i mean things don 't have any mutable value by themselves we ascribe them a value and it 's important to remember that because if we don 't then we become ahistorical the first time the possibility for independence was discussed was in so what it says to me then is that it 's not really the problem isn 't really the stories that are being told or which stories are being told the problem really is the terms of humanity that we 're willing to bring to complicate every story and that 's really what it 's all about let me tell you a nigerian joke well it 's just a joke anyway and he goes on this rant about twenty years my wife has been packing rice for lunch if she does it again tomorrow i 'm going to throw myself off this building and kill myself tom 's wife but harry 's wife is confused because she said you know harry had been packing his own lunch for twenty years when i heard it as a child in nigeria was told about igbo yoruba with the hausa being harry so what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about harry becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred my father was educated in cork in the in the ' 50s in fact every time i read in ireland people get me all mistaken and they say oh this is chris o 'barney from cork but he was also in oxford in the ' 50s and yet growing up as a child in nigeria my father used to say to me you must never eat or drink in yoruba person 's house because they will poison you it makes sense now when i think about it because if you 'd known my father you would 've wanted to poison him too so i was born in years and i was growing up in school and the federal government didn 't want us taught about the history of the war because they thought it probably would make us so what he did was to teach us jewish holocaust history and so huddled around books with photographs of people in picture this really picture this a pakistani muslim teaching jewish holocaust history and it should come as no surprise that my first novel at taking over nigeria to institute the fourth reich it makes perfect sense and they were foiled by a nigerian james bond called coyote williams and a jewish a jewish nazi hunter and it happened over four continents and when the book came out i was heralded as africa 's answer to frederick forsyth which is a dubious honor at i grew up very privileged and it 's important to talk about privilege because we don 't talk about it here a lot of us are very privileged i grew up servants cars televisions all that stuff my story of nigeria growing up was very different from the story i encountered in prison and i had no language for and six months after that with no explanation they let me go now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much but i mean i grew up with this incredible privilege and not just me millions of nigerians grew up with books and libraries in fact we were talking last night about how all of the the steamy novels of harold robbins had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in africa than any sex education programs ever had we are squandering the most valuable resource we have on this continent the valuable resource of the imagination in the film sometimes in april by raoul peck and he 's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend fellow rwandan army officer albeit a tutsi played by fraser james and fraser 's on his knees we are ashamed and we want to say to idris chop him up shut him up and as idris moves fraser screams because if you do this you will be lost to be so afraid that you 're but to say in that moment as fraser says to idris tell my girlfriend i love her fraser says but this is a redemption we can all aspire to they proliferate i really don 't care anymore i 'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves how as a writer i find that african writers have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent the question is how do i balance narratives that are wonderful with narratives of wounds and self loathing and this is the difficulty that i face i am trying to move beyond political rhetoric to a place of ethical questioning i am asking us to balance the idea of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion of transformation of what is possible as a young middle class launched myself along with a whole generation of us into the campaign to to stop the government and i asked millions of people without questioning my right to do so to go up against the government and i watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed i justified it and i said this is the cost of revolution have i not myself been imprisoned have i not myself been beaten righteous war excuse me transformation is a difficult and slow process sometimes i can stand before the world and say my name is chris abani i have been human it 's never going to be easy there are no answers as i was telling rachel from google earth that i had challenged my students in america i said you don 't know anything about africa you 're all idiots and so they said tell me about africa professor abani so i went to google earth and learned about africa and the truth be told this is it isn 't it there are no i want to believe when i was ten i read james baldwin 's another country and that book broke me because i was encountering homosexual sex and love for the first time but because the way james wrote about it made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it here jimmy said here is love all of it the fact that it happens in another country takes you quite by surprise my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in he also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential pure identity"
