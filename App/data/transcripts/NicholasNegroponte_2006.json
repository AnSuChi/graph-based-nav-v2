  "transcript": "i 've been at mit for forty four years i went to ted i there 's only one other person here i think who did that lab was doing which today has almost five hundred people in it and if you read the press last week it actually said i quit the media lab i didn 't quit the media lab i stepped down as chairman which was a kind of ridiculous title but someone else has taken it on and one of the things you can do as a professor is you stay on as a professor and i will now do for the rest of my life the one laptop per and then what we 're doing and at some point i 'll even pass around what the $ one hundred laptop might be like i was asked by chris to talk about some of the big issues and so i figured i 'd i 'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this and the first is pretty obvious it 's amazing when you meet a head of state and you say what is your most precious natural resource they will not say children at first and then when you say children they will pretty quickly agree with you and so that isn 't very hard they include sometimes can be just education and can never be without some element of education so that 's certainly part of it and the third is a little bit less obvious and that is that we all in this room learned how to walk how to talk not by being taught how to talk or taught whereas and one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the so with those as the principles some of you may know seymour papert this is back in and eighty two when we were working in senegal because some people laptop just happened and in fact back to the ' 60s here we 're in the ' 80s steve jobs had given us some laptops we were in senegal but they could just swim like fish they could play these like pianos a i got involved personally and these are two anecdotes one was in cambodia in a village that has no electricity no water no but has broadband internet now and these kids their first english word is google and they go home at night they 've got a broadband connection in a and talk about this is the actual school in parallel with this seymour papert got the governor of maine to legislate one laptop per child in the year two thousand and two now at the time i think it 's fair to say that eighty percent of the teachers were and they really preferred that the money would be used for higher salaries more schools whatever and they 're reporting five things drop parent teacher meetings which nobody did and now almost everybody does drop in discipline problems increase in student participation teachers are now saying it 's kind of fun to teach so when you see that kind of thing this is not something that you have to test the days of pilot projects are over when people say we 'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works screw you go to the back of the line and someone else will do it and then when you figure out and this is what we 're doing so one laptop per child was formed about a year and a half ago it 's a nonprofit association it raised about twenty million dollars to do the the engineering to just get this built and then have it produced afterwards scale is truly important and it 's not important because it 's because you can go to a manufacturer and i will leave the name out but we wanted a small display doesn 't have to have perfect color uniformity it can even have a pixel or two missing and this particular manufacturer said we 're not interested in that we 're interested in the living room we 're interested in perfect color uniformity we 're interested in big displays bright displays you 're not part of our strategic plan and i said that 's kind of too bad because we need one hundred million units a year and they said oh well maybe we could become part of your and that 's why i said i said seven to ten million there and we 're doing it we will do it by going to seven large countries and getting them to agree it 's not hard to guess google would be one the others and this has been in the press a great deal it 's the so called green machine that we introduced with kofi annan in november at the world summit that was held in tunisia now and the fun part and i 'm quite focused on it i tell people i used to be a light bulb but now i 'm a laser because laptop economics are the following none of those figure into our cost because first of all we sell it at cost and the governments distribute it it gets distributed to the school system like a textbook so that piece disappears then you have display and everything else now the display on your laptop costs in rough numbers that can drop to eight it can drop to seven but it 's not going to drop to two or to one and a half unless we do some some pretty clever things it 's the rest that little brown box that is pretty fascinating because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself and we have a situation today which is incredible i 've been using laptops since their inception and my laptop runs slower less reliably and less pleasantly than it ever has before and this year is worse sometimes you even get standing ovations and i say what the hell 's wrong with you why are we all sitting there and somebody to and i said god our laptop 's going to go like a bat out of hell when you open it up it 's going to when you bought an apple and we 've been going steadily downhill now people ask all the time what it is that 's what it is the two pieces that are probably notable and then just need one or two points of backhaul you can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits so you really can bring into a village and then the villages can connect themselves and you really can do it the dual mode display the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors isn 't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight well you can 't see it and whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software but when it 's backlit it 's color and when it 's 's black and white at three times the resolution is it all worked out no that 's why a lot of our people are more or less living in taiwan right now and in about thirty days we 'll know for sure whether this works and this is again something that people don 't believe but i really think it 's quite true that 's the machine we showed now i 'm going to pass this around this isn 't a design ok this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it for you to play with and it 's clearly just a model the working one is at mit i 'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman at least you can decide whether it goes left so it 's sort of an electronic book this is where when you go outside it 's in black and white but it 'll also be a games machine book machine set it up this way and it 's a television set etc etc is ok sorry seven countries i say maybe for massachusetts because they actually have to do a bid by law you 've got to bid and so on and so forth so i can 't quite name them in the other cases they don 't have to do bids they can decide it 's the federal government in each case it 's kind of agonizing because a lot of people say let 's do it at the state level because states are more nimble than than the feds just because of size and yet we count we 're really dealing with the federal government we 're really dealing with ministries of education and if you look at governments around the world ministries of education tend to be the most conservative and also the ones that have huge payrolls really hard and so it it 's certainly the hard road if you look at the countries distributed have they all agreed no not completely probably thailand brazil and nigeria are the three that are the most active and most agreed we 're purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones and since i visit each one of those countries within at least every three months i 'm just going around the world every three weeks here 's sort of the schedule and i put at the bottom we might might give some away free in two years at this meeting everybody says it 's a $ one hundred laptop you can 't do it well guess what we 're not we 're coming in probably at one hundred to start then drift down and that 's very important because so many things hit it can 't be afforded or it can 't be scaled out so we 're targeting fifty dollars in two thousand and ten the gray market 's a big issue and one of the ways just one but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique it 's a little bit like the fact that and why because there 's no market for post office trucks it looks like a post office truck you can spray paint it you can do anything you so we want to make it very much like a white volvo each government has a task force this perhaps is less interesting but we 're trying to get the governments to all work together the economics of this is to start with the subsequently go to other an uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present i mean there are all sorts of things that will happen i say it 's an education project the answer is the system certainly has software but no we 're not providing the education content that is really done in the in the countries but we are certainly constructionists and we certainly believe in learning by doing and everything from logo which was started and that 's the rollout are we dreaming is this real the only criticism and people really don 't want to criticize this because it is a humanitarian effort the one thing that people could criticize was great idea but these guys can 't do it professors and so on couldn 't do it or that it 's not possible well on december twelve a company called quanta agreed to build it and since they make about one third of all the laptops on the planet today so it 's not a matter of whether it 's going to happen and thank you"
