  "transcript": "like many of you i 'm one of the lucky people i was born to a family where education was pervasive i 'm a third generation phd a daughter of two academics in my childhood i played around in my father 's university lab so it was taken for granted that i attend some in some parts of the world for example south africa education is just not readily accessible the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white and as a consequence today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education that scarcity led to a crisis in january of this year at the university of johannesburg there were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions when the gates opened there was a stampede she was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life but even in parts of the world like the united states where education is available it might not be within reach there has been much discussed in the last few years about the rising cost of health care what might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate for a total of five hundred and fifty nine percent since this makes education unaffordable for many people the doors of opportunity might not open only a little over half of recent college graduates in the united states who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education this of course is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions tom friedman in his recent new york times article captured let 's talk about what 's suddenly possible what 's suddenly possible was demonstrated by three big stanford classes each of which had an enrollment of one hundred thousand people or more so to understand this let 's look at one of those classes the machine learning class offered by my colleague and andrew teaches one of the bigger stanford classes it 's a machine learning class and it has four hundred people enrolled every time it 's offered so to put that number in perspective for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford he would have to do that for two hundred and fifty years of course he 'd get really bored whose goal is to take the best courses from the best instructors at the best universities and provide it to everyone around the world for free currently have forty three courses on the platform from four universities across a range of disciplines and let me show you a little bit of an overview of what that looks like set the red to zero paul offit vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus dan jurafsky does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose well that sounds funny we have one point five million enrollments six million quizzes in the fifteen classes that have launched so far have been submitted whether it 's akash who comes from a small town in india and would never have access in this case to a stanford quality course and would never be able to afford it who is a single mother of two and wants to hone her skills so that she can go back and complete her master 's degree or i 'm really glad to say recently we 've been in correspondence with ryan that this story had a happy ending baby shannon you can see her on the left is doing much better now and ryan got a job by taking some of our courses so what made these courses so different after all online course content has been available for a while you can see the deadlines and the usage graph these are the spikes showing that procrastination is global phenomenon at the end of the course the students got a certificate they could present that certificate to a prospective employer and get a better job and we know many students who did some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit so these students were really getting something meaningful for their investment of time the first component is that when you move away from the constraints of a physical classroom and design content explicitly for an online format you can break away from for example the monolithic one hour lecture you can break up the material each of which represents a coherent concept students can traverse this material in different ways depending on their background their skills or their interests some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue so this format allows us to break away from model of education and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum of course we all know as educators that students don 't learn by sitting and passively watching videos perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material order to really understand it demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice where students are just for example even our videos are not just videos every few minutes the video pauses and the students get asked a question sp these four things prospect they 're all well documented so they 're all well documented deviations from rational behavior dk so here the video pauses and the student types in the answer into the box obviously they weren 't paying attention there 's an optional explanation if they want and now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture but when i ask and then there 's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it and so the lecture moves on before really most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked here every single student has to engage with the material and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story one needs to build in much more and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions now how do you grade the work of one hundred thousand students if you do not have ten thousand tas and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework we can grade models whether it 's financial models in a business class or physical models in a science or engineering class and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments let me show you one that 's actually pretty simple but fairly visual this is from stanford 's computer science one hundred and one class and the students are supposed to and they 're told that and they can move on to the next assignment this ability to interact actively with the material and be told when you 're right or wrong is really essential to student learning now of course we cannot yet grade the so we had to come up with a different solution and the solution we ended up using is peer grading it turns out that previous studies show like this one by saddler and good that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades that on the y axis are actually very well correlated with the teacher assigned grade on the x axis what 's even more surprising is that self grades where the students grade their own work critically so long as you incentivize them properly so they can 't give themselves a perfect score so we now have the largest peer grading pipeline ever devised where tens of thousands of students are grading each other 's work and quite successfully but this is not just about students sitting alone in their living room working through problems around each one of our courses a community of students had formed a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor what you see here is a self generated map from students in our princeton they have put themselves on a world map and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort and the really amazing thing is because there were so many students it means that even if a student posed a question at three o 'clock in the morning somewhere around the world there would be somebody who was awake which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students and you can see from the student testimonials that students actually find that because of this large online community they got to interact with each other in many ways that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom students also any kind of intervention from us into small study groups some of these were physical study groups along geographical constraints and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets this is the san francisco study group but there were ones all over and on the bottom left there you see our multicultural universal study group where people explicitly wanted to connect with people from other cultures there are some tremendous opportunities the first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning you can collect every click every homework submission every forum post from tens of thousands of students so you can turn the study of human learning from the data driven mode a transformation that for example has you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not so here 's an example of that also from andrew 's machine learning class this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrew 's assignments the answers happen to be pairs of numbers so you can draw them on this but when two thousand students give the same wrong answer it 's kind of hard to miss so andrew and his students went in looked at some of those assignments and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively so this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30 year old problem educational researcher benjamin bloom the second is a so the students couldn 't move on to the next topic before there was a population of students that were taught in a one on one instruction using a tutor the mastery based population was a full standard deviation or sigma in achievement scores better than the and the individual tutoring gives you two sigma improvement in performance so in a lecture based class half the students are above that level and half are below imagine if we could teach so that so the question is how can we use technology to push from the left side of the graph from the blue curve to the right side with the green curve and it doesn 't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times we 've seen that in many of the examples that i 've shown you and even personalization is something that we 're starting to see the beginnings of whether it 's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum or some of the personalized feedback that we 've shown you so the goal here if this is so great are universities now obsolete without passing through the brains of either i beg to differ with mark twain though i think what he was complaining about is not is not universities but rather the lecture based format that so many universities spend so much time on so let 's go back even further to plutarch who said that the mind is not a vessel that needs filling but wood that needs igniting and maybe we should spend less time at universities filling our performance improves on every single what would that do first it would establish education fundamental human right where anyone around the world with the ability and the motivation could get the skills that they need to make a better life for themselves their families and their communities second it would enable lifelong learning it 's a shame that for so many people learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college by having this amazing content be available we would be able to learn something new every time we wanted whether because amazing talent can be found anywhere maybe the next albert einstein or the next steve jobs"
