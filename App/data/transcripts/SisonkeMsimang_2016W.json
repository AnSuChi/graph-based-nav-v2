  "transcript": "and my research primarily consisted of googling how to give a great ted talk and interspersed with that i was googling chimamanda ngozi adichie how many of you know who that is and the combination of those searches kept leading me to her talk on the dangers of a single story on what happens when we have a solitary lens through which to understand certain groups of people and it is the perfect talk it 's the talk that i would have given if i had been famous first you know and you she 's african and i 'm african and she 's a feminist and i 'm a feminist and she 's a storyteller and i 'm a storyteller so i really felt like it 's my talk and then i was going to hack the internet and then one morning i woke up to the news that the wife of a certain presidential candidate had given a speech that that sounded eerily like a speech given by one of my other faves obama and so that is what i am here to do i 'm here to talk about my own observations about storytelling particularly for those of us who are interested in social and if there was a danger in the telling of one tired old tale then i think there has got to be lots to celebrate about the flourishing of so many stories and so many voices stories are the antidote to bias you can hear an indigenous man in australia talk about the trials and triumphs of raising his children in dignity and in pride stories make us fall in love rifts and they bridge divides stories can even make it easier for us to talk about the deaths of people in our societies who don 't matter because they make us care right and i actually work for a place called the centre for stories and my job is to help to tell stories challenge mainstream narratives about what it means to be black or a muslim or a refugee or any of those other categories that we talk about and so i 'm really interested in the ways that people talk about nonfiction storytelling as though it 's about more than entertainment as though it 's about being a catalyst for particularly the stories about people who no one seems to care about can often get in the way of action towards social justice now this is not because storytellers mean any harm quite the contrary storytellers like me and i suspect yourselves and the audiences of storytellers are often deeply compassionate and empathetic people still good intentions can have and so i want to propose that stories are not as magical as they seem so three because it 's always got to be three three reasons why i think that stories don 't necessarily make the world a better place firstly stories can create an illusion of solidarity but you didn 't you haven 't done anything listening is an important but insufficient step towards social action secondly i think often we are drawn towards characters and protagonists who are likable and human and if you don 't care about them you don 't have to see yourself as having a i learned this so my bike was stolen while i was riding it which is possible if you 're riding slowly which i was so one minute i 'm cutting across this field in the nairobi neighborhood where i grew up and it 's like and so when you 're riding a bike you don 't want to be like and so i 'm going like this slowly pedaling and all of a sudden i 'm on the floor and he 's about eleven or twelve years old and i 'm on the floor and i 'm crying because i saved a lot of money for that bike and i 'm crying and i stand up and i start screaming instinct steps in and i start screaming and they 've captured him they 've caught him the suspect has been apprehended and they make him give me my bike back and they also make him apologize again you but he looks at me with this unbridled fury he is very very and it is the first time that i have been confronted with someone who doesn 't like me simply because of what i represent he looks at me with this look as if to say you with your shiny skin and your bike you 're angry at me sometimes it 's the messages that we don 't want to hear the ones that make us want to crawl out of ourselves that we need to hear the most for every lovable storyteller who steals your heart there are hundreds more whose voices are slurred and ragged who don 't get to stand up on a stage dressed in fine clothes like this there are a million stories and we can 't afford to ignore them simply because we don 't like their protagonists or because that 's not the kid that we would bring home with us from the orphanage the third but we don 't necessarily link that to oppression we when someone says they felt small but we don 't link that to discrimination increasingly we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play where stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news yeah we live in a time where we are witnessing the decline of facts when emotions rule and analysis it 's kind of boring right where we value what we feel more than what we actually know a recent report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that only ten percent of young adults under the age of thirty a lot of trust in the media now this is significant it means that storytellers are gaining trust at precisely the same moment that many in the media are losing the confidence in the public this is not a good thing because while stories are important and they help us to have insights in many ways we need the media from my years as a social justice activist i know very well that we need credible facts from media institutions combined with the powerful voices of storytellers that 's what pushes the needle forward in terms of social justice it is justice that makes the world a better place not stories and so if it is justice that we are after then i think we mustn 't focus on the media or on storytellers we must focus on audiences on anyone who has ever turned on a radio or listened to a podcast and that means all of us so firstly the world would be secondly the world would be a better place if audiences recognized that storytelling is intellectual work for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in or click here to contribute to your storyteller 's next big idea often we are committed to the platforms and then lastly i think that audiences can make the world a better place by switching off their phones alice walker has said look closely at the present you are constructing it should look like the future you are dreaming storytellers can help us to dream thank you"
