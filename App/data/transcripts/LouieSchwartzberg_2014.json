  "transcript": "because we 're surrounded by things we can 't see and i love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space to make the invisible visible because what that does it expands our horizons it transforms our perception it opens our minds and it touches our heart so here are some scenes from my 3d imax film mysteries of the unseen there is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect we can see how organisms emerge and grow how a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight the grand scale time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion but the restless movement of humanity each streaking dot represents a passenger plane we can see something that 's above us constantly but invisible the vast network of air travel over the united states and decades of data give us the view of our entire planet as a single organism sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans pulsing with lightning crowned by the aurora borealis it may be the ultimate time lapse image the anatomy of earth brought to life at the other extreme there are things that move too fast for our eyes but we have technology that can look into that world as well we can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision and we can see how nature 's ingenious devices work and perhaps we can even imitate them when a dragonfly flutters by you may not realize it can hover fly backwards even upside down nobody knew the secret high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time and what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places we 're unaware of things that are too small for us to see the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times crawling over your skin at night can you guess what this is shark skin a caterpillar 's mouth the eye of a fruit fly but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered because spiders ' silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel but completely elastic this journey will take us all the way down to the nano world the silk is one hundred times thinner than human hair three strands of dna single carbon atoms with the tip of a powerful microscope we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way tiny chemical machines of the future can one day perhaps repair dna born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life so under an endless rain of cosmic dust the air is full of pollen micro diamonds and jewels from other planets people go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable and this new perspective creates wonder and who knows what awaits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives we 'll just have to see"
