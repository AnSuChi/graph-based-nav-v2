  "transcript": "a very old magazine i found this observation test about the story of the ark and the artist that drew this observation test did some errors had some mistakes there are more or less twelve mistakes some of them are very easy there is a funnel and this problem is now we have god that is going to submerge earth and no one is taking care of plants but no mention about plants why in another part of the same story all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out so birds livestock and wild animals plants are not living creatures this is the point that is a point that is not coming out from let 's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book here we have the description it 's a nice description because it 's starting from left you have the stones there is the man this is not the common man is quite comforting for people like me i 'm a professor because plants are not just able to live they are able to they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals just to give you an example every single root apex is able to detect and to monitor concurrently and continuously at least fifteen different chemical and physical parameters and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence well this is something this underestimation of plants is something that is always with us now david attenborough is really a plant lover when he speaks about plants it 's a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet that is this wonderful low level organisms has been formalized many times ago by aristotle that in de anima that is a very influential book for the western civilization wrote that the plants are on the edge it 's called the vegetative soul let 's see okay some of the movements of the plants are very well known this is very fast movement this is a dionaea a venus fly trap hunting snails sorry for the snail this has been something that has been refused for centuries despite the evidence but plants are also able to to show a lot of movement some of them are very well known like the flowering it 's just a question to to use some techniques like the time lapse some of them are much more sophisticated look at this young they are also able to play they are really they are training themselves they are able to respond to gravity of course so the shoots are growing against the vector of gravity and the roots toward the so during the night they curl the leaves this is interesting because this sleeping machinery it 's perfectly conserved it 's the same in plants in insects and in animals and so if you need to study this sleeping problem it 's easy to study on plants for example and it 's much more easy even ethically it 's a kind of vegetarian experimentation plants are they are able to distinguish kin and non kin they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles for example during the pollination now with the pollination it 's a very serious issue for plants because they move the pollen from one flower to the other yet they cannot move from one flower to the other so they need a vector and this vector normally an animal many insects have been used by plants and mammals like bats rats this is a serious business we have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance very energizing having in change this transportation of the pollen but some plants are manipulating animals like in the case of orchids that promise sex and nectar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the pollen to do this without a brain we need to wait until one thousand eight hundred and eighty when publishes a the title is the power of movement in plants no one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before charles darwin assisted by his son francis who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world in cambridge they took into consideration every single movement for five hundred pages and in the last paragraph of the book the most important it 's hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals this is not a metaphor he wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was j d hooker or at that time president of the royal society so the maximum scientific authority in britain speaking this is a root apex so you can recognize this kind of movement the same movement that worms snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display and it 's not an easy movement because to have this kind of movement you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having so we studied and in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important you have the signals that you are seeing here are action potential are the same signals that the neurons of my brain of our brain use to to exchange information now we know that a root apex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of we have almost fourteen million roots we have eleven and a half million root apex and a total length of six hundred or more kilometers and a very high surface area now let 's imagine that each single root apex is working in network with have on the left the internet and on the right the root apparatus they work in the same way they are a network of small computing machines working in networks and why are they so similar because they evolved for the same reason to survive predation so you can remove ninety percent of the root apparatus and the plants [ continue ] to work you can remove ninety percent of the internet and to work so a suggestion for the people working with networks plants until now the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing we have the animaloid but why have we not it 's good that you look at birds to be inspired by birds but if you want to explore soils or if you want to colonize best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this it 's much more easy to build hybrids hybrid means it 's they have electrical signals the connection with the machine is much more easy much more even ethically possible and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build driven by algae or by the leaves at the end by the most most powerful parts of the plants by the thank you for your attention thank you"
