  "transcript": "i 'm here to talk about the wonder and the mystery in fact because without we would have no knowledge whatsoever about our humanity we would have no knowledge whatsoever about we would have no access to love or to the ability to create scott fitzgerald said famously that he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for but he also forgot that without consciousness he would have no access to true happiness and even the so much for the wonder now for the mystery this is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate all the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience it 's not to be solved i don 't believe that it would be ridiculous to claim that we know how we make consciousness and we can begin to see the shape of a solution and one more wonder to celebrate is the fact that we have imaging technologies that now allow and which show you in a living brain the reconstruction of that brain and this is a person who is alive this is not a person that is amazed about is what i 'm going to show you next which is going underneath the surface of the brain and actually looking in the living brain at real the fibers that join but at any rate they are there the colors are codes for the direction from whether it is back to front or vice versa what is consciousness what is a conscious mind and we could take a very simple view and say well it is that which we lose when we fall into deep sleep without dreams and it is what we regain when we recover from sleep or from anesthesia and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns visual but there is something else that we are all experiencing in this room we are not passive exhibitors of visual or we have a me that is automatically present in our minds right now we own our minds and we have a sense that it 's everyone of us that is experiencing this not the person who is sitting you have a self within the conscious mind so a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it so what we need to know to even address this mystery is number one how are minds are put together in the brain and number two how selves are constructed now the first part the first problem and so imagine a grid like the one i 'm showing you right now and now imagine within that two dimensional sheet imagine neurons and picture if you will a digital billboard where you have elements that can be either lit or not and depending on how you create the pattern of lighting or not lighting the digital elements or for that matter the neurons in the sheet you 're going to be able to construct a map or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate now to bring home the point of how close it is so if i cover my left eye i 'm talking about me personally not all of you if i cover my left eye i look at the grid pretty but sometime ago i discovered that if i cover my if i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what i get is the following on the right side my retina is perfectly symmetrical you see the going down towards the fovea which is marked there by the red arrow and it corresponds to a little cyst that is located below and that is exactly what causes the warping of my visual image so just think of this you have a grid of neurons and now you have a plane mechanical close your mental experience and the activity of the neurons in the retina which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball or for that matter a sheet of visual cortex so from the retina you go onto visual cortex and of course the brain adds on a lot of information to what is going on in the signals that come from the retina and in that image there you have the green for example that corresponds to tactile information or the and something else that happens is that those image making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps purple that you see around which is the association cortex where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image making and the great and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception so think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the the brain is so it provides certain areas for perception and image making and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image making when we recall information but what about the self the self is really and for a long time people did not even want to touch it because they 'd say how can you have this reference point this stability that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day and i thought about a solution to this problem so let me tell you just a little bit about how i came to this i came to this because if you 're going to have a reference that we know as self the me the i in in our own well it so and the things that have to do what is known as our internal milieu for example the whole management of the chemistries within our body are in fact extremely maintained day after day for one very good reason if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that so we within our own lives that ensures some kind of continuity i like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day because if you don 't have that so that 's one more element for this continuity but there 's no physiological bond between the images i have of you as an audience and my however there is a close permanently maintained bond between the body regulating parts of my brain and my own look at the region there there is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord and it is within that region that i 'm going to highlight now that we have this housing of all the devices of if you damage that which is a state of course in which your mind disappears your consciousness disappears what happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self you have no longer access to any feeling of your except you don 't know they 're there you have in effect lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem but if you consider the green part if you damage it and often it happens you know you have a fully conscious mind that you can report very indirectly this is a horrific condition you don 't want to see it but they do have a mind there was a very interesting film one of the rare good films done about a situation like this by julian schnabel some except this is to frighten you it there are to make it simple all those little squares that correspond to modules that actually make brain maps of different aspects of our and it is out of this and out of this tight coupling between the brain stem and the body that i believe and i could be wrong but i don 't think i am comes in the form of feelings primordial feelings by the way so what is the picture that we get here look at cerebral cortex look at brain stem look at body and you get the picture of the interconnectivity and you have the cerebral cortex providing the great spectacle of our minds with you cannot have a conscious mind if you don 't have the interaction between cerebral cortex and brain stem you the design of the brain stem except that they 're not as rich as ours because they don 't have a cerebral cortex like we do that 's where the difference is and i strongly disagree with the idea that consciousness should be considered as the great product of the cerebral cortex only the wealth of our minds is not the very fact that we have a self that we can refer the core and the autobiographical the first two are shared it 's the autobiographical self which some species have i think cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to but the novelty is here the autobiographical self is built on the basis it 's the lived past and the anticipated future and the autobiographical self has prompted extended memory reasoning imagination creativity and language out of that came the instruments of culture and it is within that culture that we really can get and this is the novelty something that is not it is developed in the cultures it developed in collectives of the culture where why care about this why care if it is the brain stem three reasons first curiosity why should we not be interested in what is going on inside of human second understanding society and culture we should look at how society and culture medicine let 's not forget that some of the worst diseases of humankind are diseases such as depression you have no prayer of treating those diseases effectively and in a so that 's a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we 're doing and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains"
