  "transcript": "and i 'm an undiagnosed dyslexic i had a really hard time in school in fact my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried cynthia and together over twenty years we built an amazing jewelry business and then we retired then she took me to see a film that i really didn 't want to see it ruined my life i have four kids they 're not going to have the life that i and i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities so it has an intact cynthia and i were there we had had and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give back i know it doesn 't look like a school but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely extremely green the classrooms have no walls the desks are not square and for me it 's just the idea that if this little girl graduates as a chances are she 'll demand a whole world a whole world to live on our children spend one hundred and eighty one days going to school in a box the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum so if this gentleman had had a holistic education would he have had more possibilities in his life they 're beautiful they 're bamboo the breeze passes through them and when the natural breeze isn 't enough the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know these bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree so we basically turned the box into a bubble and these kids know that painless climate control may not be part we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible and then they signed up for two extra courses the first one was called sanding and the second one was called re waxing but since that happened they own they know they can control their world but an amazing alternative energy company in paris and this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world in a two and a half meter drop on a river when the turbine drops in and you know what these and as long as we 're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water you 're all really smart just do the math how many people times how much water there isn 't enough water these are compost toilets and nobody at the school wanted to know about them especially the principal and they work people use them people are okay the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months we had to replace them with recyclable plastic the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms so we had some good ideas we took old automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard and it 's on twenty acres of rolling garden there 's an amazing river traveling through it and you can see there how we manage to get across the river he looked a little crazed i said welcome to green school he said i 've been on an airplane for twenty four hours i asked him why he said i had a dream once about a green school and i saw a picture of this green school i got on an airplane in august i 'm bringing my sons this was a great and people are bringing their green industries hopefully their green restaurants it 's becoming a green model we had to look at everything no petrochemicals in the pavement no pavement these are volcanic stones laid by hand there are no sidewalks he 's planning to eat that fence for dinner all the fences at green school are green and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate they found out the fence was made out of they took the tapioca roots up to the we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms we dropped them gently in we made space for these guys and the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field these young ladies but they know something that few people know in a rice culture they know how to plant organic rice they 're part of the rice cycle this young man is picking organic vegetables we feed four hundred people lunch every day local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know the food local and global i know it 's a school where you do learn reading one of my favorites writing i was bad at it arithmetic but you also learn other things you learn bamboo building you practice ancient balinese arts this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields the mothers aren 't quite convinced laughter we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and local means that twenty percent of the population of the school has to be balinese and people are coming forward from all over the world and the amazing thing is that and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed the green school effect we don 't know what it is we need but what 's happening our learning different kids dyslexic we 've renamed them prolexic are doing well in these beautiful beautiful and how did we do all this on giant grass it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested to build buildings like this it 's as strong and dense as teak and it will hold up and you 've probably seen things like this the yellow box was called the administration complex we squashed it we rethought it but mainly it has administrators in it and many many other things and the problem of building it when the balinese workers saw long reams of plans they looked at them and said what 's this so we built we had them engineered by the engineers and balinese carpenters like this selected the bamboo and built the buildings using and the balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building we realized that we had a cathedral a cathedral to green and a cathedral to from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful we believe it is green school is a model we built for the world it 's a model we built for bali let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren but you gave me an incredible please come and see us thank you"
