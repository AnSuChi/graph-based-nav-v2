  "transcript": "they told me that i 'm a traitor to my own profession that i should go back to my own email got hacked in a discussion forum for other doctors someone took credit for but then came the response too bad it wasn 't a real bomb i grew up in china and my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital because i had such bad asthma that i was there nearly every week she was one of those doctors who if you fell and broke your arm she would ask you why you weren 't laughing because it 's your humerus get it see you 'd groan but my parents and i moved to the u s and ours became the typical immigrant narrative my parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed everything changed my mother called me to tell me that she wasn 't feeling well she had a cough that wouldn go away she was short of breath and tired well i knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything i knew something had to be really wrong and it was my mother was brave though and she had hope she went through surgery and radiation and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book but she found something else too he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company and in fact often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her but maybe it wasn 't it made her scared and it made her doubt when it comes to medicine having that trust is a must and when that trust is gone then i was taking care of this 19 year old who was biking back to his dorm when he got struck and hit which i thought was a reasonable request and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared doctor though said no maybe they 'll stop students from asking questions he even said what if they see mistakes and sue us we have to put on our white coats put up a wall and hide behind there 's a hidden epidemic in medicine of course patients are scared when they come to the doctor imagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache you go to the hospital you 're lying in this strange place you 're on this hospital gurney you 're wearing this flimsy gown strangers are coming to poke and prod at you you don 't know what 's going to happen you don 't even know if you 're going to get the blanket you asked for thirty minutes ago just patients who are scared doctors are scared too we 're scared of patients finding out who we are and what medicine is all about and so what do we do we put on our white coats and we hide behind them of course the more we hide the more people want to know what it is that we 're hiding the more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do can we overcome the sickness of fear let me ask you differently if hiding isn 't the answer what if we did the opposite what if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients literally took their research to the streets chinese restaurants and train stations what did they find well when we asked people what do you want to know about your healthcare responded with what they want to know about their doctors because people understand health care to be the individual interaction between them and their doctors some want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased and is making decisions based on evidence and science not on who says that it 's important to her for her doctor to share her values when it comes to reproductive choice and women 's rights frank a 59 year old hardware store owner doesn 't even like going to the doctor and wants to find someone who believes in prevention first but who is comfortable with alternative treatments one after another our respondents told us that that doctor patient relationship is a deeply intimate one that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets they want to first understand their because doctors have to see every patient doesn 't mean that patients have to see every doctor people want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we 're in and we talk about how we 're paid incentives matter you might want to know he 's getting paid five thousand dollars to perform spine surgery versus twenty five dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist or if he 's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends alternative medicine preventive health and end of life decisions we pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you so you have a right to know who we are we believe that transparency can be the cure for fear here are a few from a gastroenterologist in portland i devoted twelve years of my life to being a slave i have loans and mortgages i depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients but try telling your patient making thirty five thousand dollars a year to serve a family of four that you need the free lunch from an orthopedic surgeon in charlotte i find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from my patients don 't disclose their incomes to me but your patients ' sources of income don 't affect your health from a psychiatrist in new york city pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs what model of car we drive and what toilet paper we use but your views on a woman 's right to choose and preventive wen needs to move back to her own country well two pieces of good news first of all this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory and second of all i 'm american and i 'm already here i received mail at my undisclosed home address with threats to contact the medical board to sanction me over social media a and thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue they wrote with things like if doctors are doing something they 're that ashamed of they shouldn 't be doing it elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions lawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests why shouldn 't doctors people wrote and said let us patients decide what 's important when we 're choosing a doctor but actually this is not that new of a concept at all remember dr sam my doctor in china with the goofy jokes and the wild hair well she was my doctor but she was also our neighbor who lived in the building across the street my parents and i trusted her because we knew who she was and what she stood for and she had no need to hide from us you knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage mother in law comes to town you knew what he was about and he had no need to hide from you i know this firsthand and she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die 12 page document about how she had suffered enough how it was time for her to go one day when i was a resident physician i got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit by the time i got there she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing you were that age how would you have liked to grow up without your mother her oncologist was there too and said this is your mother can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don 't do everything for her i understood what her directives meant so well but i was a physician that was the single hardest decision i ever made to let her die in peace and i carry those words of those doctors with me every we can bridge the disconnect between what doctors do and what patients need we can get there because we 've been there before and we know that transparency gets us to that trust research has shown us that openness also helps doctors that having open medical records being willing to talk about medical errors will increase patient trust improve health outcomes and reduce malpractice bacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy but blood pressure management and diabetes control well brandon combs an internist in denver this has brought me closer to my patients the type of relationship i 've developed that 's why i entered medicine aaron stupple an internist in denver i tell my patients that i am totally open with them now tell me about you we 're in this together i 'm not being brave it 's my job i leave you today with a final thought being totally transparent is scary you feel naked exposed and vulnerable that humility it can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine when doctors are willing to step off our pedestals take off our white coats and show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about that 's when we establish thank you"
