  "transcript": "and the food industry in general ten calories are taken to produce it that 's a lot i want to take something rather humble to discuss and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later you 're very welcome to the humble potato and i 've spent a long time twenty five years preparing these and that takes it grows and it 's then harvested and it 's then delivered to me i basically take it prepare it and then people consume it hopefully they enjoy it and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it there are different types of waste there 's a waste of time there 's a waste of space and there 's a waste of waste so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like basically a restaurant just like any other this is the restaurant floor sustainable recyclable chairs paint is all and i was thinking well i 'm trying to think nature nature nature but i thought no no experiment with resins experiment with polymers right here 's a reconditioned coffee machine it actually looks better than a brand new one so looking good there now reusing is vital which has been turned inside out and sewn up it 's got my compost in it which is growing an orange tree which is great they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted it 's a small kitchen it 's about five square meters it serves two hundred and twenty people a day we generate quite a lot of waste this but this story 's not about i have produce and boxes i compost it in this garden all of the soil you can see there is basically my food which is generated by the restaurant and it 's growing in these tubs which i made out of storm felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things three compost bins makes fantastic compost dinner it was like vegetable jerky and killed all of them i don 't know how many worms [ were ] in there but i 've got some heavy karma coming i tell you runs it through these stone beds this is going to be mint in there and i sort of water the garden with it and i ultimately want to recycle that put it back into the loos maybe wash hands with it i don 't know so water is a very important aspect i started meditating on that and created a restaurant called waterhouse if i could get waterhouse to be a no carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with that would be great i managed to do it this restaurant looks a little bit like acorn house same chairs same tables they 're all english and a little bit more sustainable now it 's important to understand that filters its own water it literally is waterhouse the air handling system inside it i got rid of air conditioning because i thought there was too much consumption going on there this is basically cooling them or heating them as the need may be and this is an english willow air diffuser and that 's which is just outside the restaurant there is i have no idea how it works but i paid a lot of money for it and what 's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat it 's and that 's fantastic there 's no accident in names of these restaurants acorn house is the element of wood waterhouse is the element of water and i 'm thinking well i 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five chinese medicine acupuncture i 'm just about to do got metal and earth to come so you 've got to watch your space for that and it 's hurting real bad the people 's supermarket so basically the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what i was doing anyway what i needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people so people i e perhaps more working class or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative this is a social enterprise it really is about the social disconnect between food communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers connecting communities in london to i 've kept the floors i 've kept the trunking i 've got in some recycled fridges i 've got some recycled tills i 've got some recycled trolleys i mean the whole thing is is super sustainable in fact i 'm trying and i 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world and no one 's doing that just yet in fact sainsbury 's if you 're watching let 's have a so nature and that 's been something that 's been nurturing me for some time and it 's an important statement to understand if we don 't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food think about the sustainable nature of it then we i wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we 're more responsible environmentally conscious businesses are doable they 're here you can see i 've done three so far i 've got a few more to go refuse and recycle right at the end there recycling is the last point i want to make but it 's the four r 's rather than the three r 's then i think we 're going to be so these three are not perfect but with help i 'm sure i 'm going to find solutions and i hope you all take part"
