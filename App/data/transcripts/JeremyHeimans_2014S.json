  "transcript": "and you wouldn 't know it by looking at him hazare is a so as part of this campaign he was using all of the traditional tactics that a good gandhian organizer would use so he was on a hunger strike and hazare realized through his hunger that actually maybe this time in the 21st century a hunger strike wouldn 't be enough so he started playing around with mobile activism so the first thing he did is he said to people okay why don 't you send me a text message if you support my campaign against corruption so he does this he gives people a short code and about eighty thousand people do it okay that 's pretty respectable but then he decides let me tweak my tactics a little bit now for those of you who have lived in the global south you 'll know that missed calls are a really critical part of global mobile culture i see people nodding so a note for a dating tip here in some cultures if you want to please your lover you call them and hang up so why do people leave missed calls well the reason of course is that they 're trying to avoid charges associated with making calls and sending texts so when hazare asked people to leave him a missed call a little guess how many people actually did this but he used that hazare ended up with this massive csv file of mobile phone numbers and i had this really funny childhood where i traipsed around the world talking about third world debt as it was then called and demilitarization i was a very very serious child ' 90s i had a very cutting edge tech tool of my own the and at that time it was the best way to get a message to a lot of people all at once i 'll give you one example of a fax campaign that i ran it was the eve of the gulf war and i organized a global campaign to flood the hotel the intercontinental in geneva where james baker and tariq aziz were meeting on the eve of the war and i thought if i could flood them with faxes we there are lots of reasons for that but there 's no doubt that one sputtering fax machine in geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint in terms of the ability to get a message to lots of people and so and i now run purpose which is a home for these kinds of technology powered movements so what 's the moral of this story is the moral of this story you know what this is another story of tech determinism well i would argue that there 's actually more to it than that i 'd argue that in the last twenty years something more fundamental has changed who has it how it 's shifting and i think we all sense that something big is happening so henry timms and i henry 's a fellow movement builder got talking one day and we started to think how can we make sense of this new world how can we describe it and give it a framework that makes it more useful because we realized that many of the lessons that we were discovering in movements actually applied all over the world in many sectors of our society new power is the deployment of mass participation and peer coordination these are the two key elements to create change and shift outcomes and we see new power all around us this is beppe grillo he was a populist italian blogger who with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools won more than twenty five percent of the vote in recent italian elections which in just a few years has radically disrupted the hotel industry without owning a single square foot of real estate this is kickstarter which we know has raised over a billion dollars from more than five million people let 's look a little bit at this new power works like a current old power is held by a few new power by a few it 's made by many so we 've talked a little bit about what new power is let 's for a second talk about what new power isn 't new power is not your facebook page i assure you that having a social media strategy can enable you to do just as much download as you used to do when you had the radio just ask syrian dictator bashar al assad i assure you that his facebook page has not embraced the power of participation but it can produce bad outcomes more participation more peer unsurprisingly as many of these new power models get to scale what you see is this massive pushback from the forces of old power just look at this really interesting epic struggle going on right now between edward snowden snowden so you think about some of these new power models right these were just like someone 's and now they 're disrupting entire industries so let 's say you 've used a peer to peer lending platform like and so that experience tends to embolden you it tends to make you want more participation across more of your life and what this gives rise to is a set of values we talked about the models that new power has engendered the what about the values and this is an early sketch at what new power values look like new power values prize transparency above all else it 's almost a religious belief in transparency a belief that if you shine a light on something it will be better and remember that in the century this was not at all true people thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors and make comfortable agreements for better or worse new power values participation and new power is all about in fact what 's interesting about new power is that it eschews some of the professionalization and how can we plot organizations on a two by two where essentially we look at new power values and new power models and see where different people sit we started with a u s analysis and let me show you some so the first is apple in this framework we actually described apple as an old power company that 's because the ideology the governing ideology of apple is the ideology of the perfectionist product designer in cupertino it 's absolutely about that beautiful perfect thing descending and it does not value as a company transparency in fact it 's very secretive now apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world so this shows that you can still pursue a successful old power strategy but one can argue that there 's real vulnerabilites in that model i think another interesting comparison is that of the obama campaign versus the obama presidency i like president obama but he ran and he said to people we are the ones we 've been waiting for and he used crowdfunding to power a campaign but when he got into office he governed like more or less all the other presidents did and this is a really interesting so this is a framework you should look at so what do you do if you 're old power well if you 're there thinking in old power this won 't happen to us then just look at the wikipedia entry for encyclopdia britannica let me tell you it 's a very sad imagine that a group of your biggest skeptics are camped in the heart of your organization asking the toughest questions and they can see everything inside of your organization and ask them would they like what they see and should our model change and in fact that model means how do you use institutional power without being institutionalized but what 's really interesting about uber is it hasn really adopted new power values this is a real quote from the uber ceo recently he says once we get rid of the dude in the car he means drivers uber will be cheaper now new power models live and die by the strength of their networks by whether the drivers and the consumers who use the service actually believe in it because they it 's extraordinary superstrcuture that is really old they 've raised more than a billion dollars in the capital markets those markets expect a financial return and they way you get a financial return is by squeezing and squeezing your so the big question about the future of new power in my view is will that old power just emerge so will new power elites just become old power and co owned by uber drivers and i think this going to be a very interesting structural question of mass participation and peer coordination these about new power is that"
