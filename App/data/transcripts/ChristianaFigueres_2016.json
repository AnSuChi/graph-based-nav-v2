  "transcript": "but here is the fact two thousand and fifteen if you 've worked with governments you know how difficult that is unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable and improve the life of all of us but it is even more remarkable after years of working toward a climate agreement the same governments convened in copenhagen why did it fail miserably i was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations you can imagine the perfect moment to start this new job the global mood on climate change was in the trash can no one believed neither did i if you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful ted audience i 'm going to divulge a secret that has been do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible and without engaging brain i heard me you can imagine the faces of my press team who were horrified at this crazy costa rican woman who was their and i was horrified too now i wasn 't horrified at me because i 'm kind of used to myself i was actually horrified at the consequences of what i had just said at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have to live hang on hang on impossible it 's an attitude it 's only an attitude and i decided right then and there that i was going to change my attitude and i was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change so i don 't know no i don 't know what you would do if you were told your job is to save the planet put that on the job description because governments are sovereign in every decision that they but here 's what i did i panicked but i do know and here i use optimism as a very simple word but let 's understand it in its broader sense let 's understand it as courage hope trust solidarity the fundamental belief that we humans can come together and can help each other to better the fate of mankind well you can imagine that i thought that without that there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of copenhagen and for six years i no matter what the questions from the press and i have gotten better at those there has been a lot of contrary evidence but relentless optimism into we began to see changes happening and i thank you and this ted community will not be surprised if i tell you the first area we began to see that clean technologies in particular renewable energy technologies began to drop price and increase in capacity to the point where today we are already building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent we were able to begin to understand but there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air better health more energy access to the developing world and with that first through because they all began to understand this actually can be in their interest this can actually improve their and it wasn 't just the usual suspects i have to tell you i had the ceo of a major major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say privately of course now we have a shift and with that with broader support from everyone it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is and when we asked countries to begin to identify how they could contribute based on their national interest once you protect the core interests of nations then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a common path onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy and the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments and the and the path itself handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient largely perceived as a burden now what do we have now we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors but all of them contributing to a common goal and along a path once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding then you see that governments were able to i look back over the past six years first i remember the day the paris agreement was adopted screaming yelling torn between euphoria because so many people had worked for years and it wasn 't just those who had participated directly a and once he had finally decided what he was going to buy because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change but the jeweler said have you heard the governments have just come to a decision and tahiti what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps perhaps here is hope here is a possible i 'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do we 've only just started our work on climate change but i do believe that we have come over the past six years years from the impossible and how did we do that by injecting transformational optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global and that if we understand that we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously as i look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century forced migration but we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change we can understand that we have got now that we 're in a world in which we have reached planetary boundaries and that not just so interconnected but increasingly interdependent on each other your loss is no longer my gain we 're either all losers but we are going to have to decide between zero and sum we 're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all or living life as the sum of all of us we 've done it once we can do it again"
