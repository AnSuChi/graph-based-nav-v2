  "transcript": "she was always saying things that made me stop and think like time may be a great healer but it ain 't no the flow here and all do this one together and i 'm going to have michael manring play bass with me a few more jumps and i 'll be she couldn 't sing much couldn 't play anymore and i 'd pull her out on the front porch down below there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule a double outhouse over here on the side devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion hey she 'll cook blackjacks he came to the campus this was in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight and he played his bluegrass style of music but near the end of the concert he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from africa along with the banjo i fell in love with that i went up to him and said how can i learn that he said well you can go back to clinch mountain where i 'm from or asheville or mount airy north carolina some place that has a lot of music because there 's a lot of old people i just fell in love with the culture so i thought i would just like to show you some of the pictures i 've taken of some of my mentors just a few of them but maybe you 'll get just a little hint of some of these folks and play a little banjo this this this those last few pictures were of ray hicks who just passed away last year he was one of the great american folk tale tellers the old jack tales that he had learned he talked like this you could but it was really wonderful and he lived in that house that his and you can look at more pictures i 've actually got a website that 's got a bunch of photos this instrument came up in those pictures it 's called the mouth bow the old timers didn 't take a fancy it was hard on the cats it made a great little instrument wide when the yankees saw them coming were driving in the car outside of gatesville texas where i grew up in the early part of my life we were really mad at my mom we looked out the window surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields you see we 'd just been to the grocery store and my mom refused to buy us the jar of ovaltine that had the coupon for the captain midnight decoder ring in it you think you can have anything you want you don 't know how hard it is to earn money your dad works so hard you think money grows on trees brother and i stepped out of the car we she went up to the foreman she said i 've got these two little boys never worked a to that foreman put these two middle class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas it 's hot so he gave us each a cotton sack about ten feet long about that big around and we started picking now and my brother and i started he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice he just sang well don want it to leave me behind there 's a we 'd each picked about a quarter of a bag but my mother would never let us cash it i 'm fifty seven still have the check but if you have children you know it doesn 't often work that way no we learned something else the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day and that was an eye opener and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field i wasn 't even aware of music not even aware of it but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart and that 's where i 've wanted to be ever since try this old song with me i sing well there 's a long white chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming and i don 't want it to leave me it 's been a while since you don 't want it to leave me behind good news chariot 's coming my mom was in the audience after the she was glad to have a story about herself of course but after the concert she came up and she said david i 've got to tell you i set that whole thing up i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work i didn 't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though let 's try good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming good news chariot 's coming and i don 't want it to leave me behind originally made by the dopyera brothers who later on made the dobro which is a wood bodied instrument with a metal cone for where the sound comes from and then african american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect this instrument pretty much saved my life and it was the most and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in i had to make lists and you know at the top of the list of course were jenny and my son zeb my parents i didn 't want to hurt them i didn 't care about nothing on the list it would be stuff like the smell of catching a wave and bodysurfing the the sound of doc watson playing the guitar listening to old records of muddy waters and uncle dave macon and i would sit around with it and i didn 't know how to play it but i would just play stuff as sad as i could play and it was the only instrument that of all the ones that i play that would really make let me tell you what i always do i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar better just to sink way down in your funky mood where you want to get but i got some medicine here that just might shake things loose call me in the morning after a dose of these steel my dad was an inventor he has a number of patents for that kind of thing and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney they were about my age john went on and michael did too to become some of the inventors of computer animation michael 's dad was working on something called the computer this of vacuum tubes as far as you could see just floors and floors of these things and one of the engineers said some day i thought damn those are going to be some big pants so that christmas maybe i 've got time for this that christmas i got the mister wizard so we looked in that this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal we made up a little batch and and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew it flared up obviously the next thing to do was so we went over into michael 's garage his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there garage we weren 't stupid we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it we stood back we lit that thing and they flew out of there they went through that plywood like it was paper two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen we tore everything down and buried it in they said they were going to beat us up if we didn 't make some gunpowder for them they said we 're going to melt it down and make make you a big batch so we made them a big batch and it was in my now we 'd just moved here we 'd just moved to california mom had redone the kitchen mom was gone that day we had a pie tin it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down it just flared up and he turned around and he looked like this there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet the air was the just full of black smoke she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again but we thought of it often because every time she 'd cook tuna surprise it made tasted faintly of gunpowder so i like to invent things too and i think i 'll close out my set with something i invented a good while back why couldn 't you take the oldest form of of music the hambone rhythms and combine it with the newest technology i call this thunderwear at that time drum i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday i 'm going to be doing some of the same ones i have a trigger here the drum triggers go out my tail here and they can make various sounds like drums so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this"
