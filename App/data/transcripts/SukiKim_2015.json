  "transcript": "i live in america and i had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning the only option was total so i posed as a teacher and a missionary at an all male university in pyongyang the pyongyang university of science and technology was founded by evangelical christians who cooperate with the regime to educate the sons of the north korean elite without proselytizing which is a capital crime there expected to be the future leaders of the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence when i arrived they became my students two thousand and eleven was a special year marking the 100th anniversary of the birth of north korea 's original great leader kim il sung and sent students as the world 's most powerful and prosperous nation my students were the only ones spared from that fate north korea every every song every tv program there is just one subject every citizen wears the badge of the great leader at all times even their calendar system begins with the birth il sung the school teachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder the students were not allowed to leave or communicate with their parents and any free time they had every blank space was covered with the portraits of kim we were never allowed to discuss the outside world as students of science and technology many of them were computer majors but they did not know the existence of the internet facebook and i could not tell them but where do you even start when an entire nation 's ideology my students ' day to day realities and even my own position at the universities were all built i started with a game we played truth and lie a volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard and the other students had to guess whether it was a truth or a lie once a student wrote i visited china last year on vacation and everyone shouted lie they all knew this wasn i had hoped that this game whether about the mythical accomplishments of their great the difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them it took me a while to understand the different types and were just regurgitating them or at moments they lied out of habit next i tried to teach them essay writing essays are about coming up with one 's own thesis and making an evidence based argument to prove it these students however were simply told what to think and they obeyed i also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter to anybody it took a long time but eventually some of them although those were just homework and would never reach their intended recipients my students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them they wrote that they were fed up they rarely ever i was spending all of my time with these young men we all ate meals together i often called them gentlemen which made them giggle and i came to adore them and watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways was deeply moving but something also felt wrong where arab youth were turning where everyone except them was connected which wasn 't worldwide after all by encouraging them to run after it i was putting them at risk of persecution when you 're not allowed to express anything in the open you become good at reading what is unspoken in one of their personal letters to me a student wrote that he understood why i always called them it was because i was wishing them to be gentle in life he said the day kim jong il 's death was announced their world shattered but i think they knew how sad i was for them once toward the end of my stay student said to me our circumstances are different we want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same i would tell them this my dear gentlemen it 's been a bit over three years since i last saw you and now you must be twenty two maybe even as old as twenty three at our final class i asked you if there was anything you wanted the only wish you expressed the only thing you ever asked of me in all those months we spent together but i understood then you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue but i don 't know if being gentle in kim jong un 's merciless north korea is a good thing i don 't want you to lead a revolution let some other young person do it the rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect some sort of north korean someone is always watching i don 't want to imagine what might happen to you if my attempts to reach you have inspired something new safe lives but i know why you asked the one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from declare your city as the most beautiful but no i don 't find your capital beautiful but because of what it symbolizes a monster that feeds off the rest of the country where citizens are soldiers and slaves all i see there is darkness it 's your home so i cannot hate it thank you"
