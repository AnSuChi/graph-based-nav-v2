  "transcript": "and you might remember some of but it was also the signal that capped the use or overuse of devices so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop great right well we have similar problems in buildings in the past before air conditioning we had thick walls and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of of temperature transfer between the interior and and with that came the they require a huge amount of energy they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere and for some of you may and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again even worse with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net zero energy state we can 't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient we need to look for something else and we 've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut so what do we do here how do at biology and many of you probably don 't know i was a biology major before i went into architecture it has pores it has sweat glands it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently and so what i propose is that our building skins should be more similar to and this gets me back to my research what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that i presently or currently work with smart materials and a smart and that 's a very big deal for architecture what it one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen and currently have this installation at the materials & applications gallery in silver lake close by and it 's there until august if you want to see it it 's called bloom and the surface is made completely out of and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things one it 's a ventilating system so that hot trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary you can see here in this time lapse video that the sun as it moves across the surface as well as the shade each of the tiles moves individually every single one is different very specific to its location to the angle of the sun and also how the thing actually curls so this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications and in this case here you see a house that 's for a developer in china but now it 's sheathed with this layer it 's a screen that goes around it and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface in addition to that and what it basically implies is that in houses now need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building i 'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market and so here you see a pretty typical and in that panel between those two pieces of glass that i 'm trying to work on making a thermo bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and and totally if necessary and so you can imagine even in this application that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to thirty forty floors the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface it 's actually smaller pieces of thermometal and it 's actually going to we 're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes this last project is also of components the influence and if you have noticed one of my spheres of influence is biology is from a grasshopper and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system they breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down and so in this project and so you see here some early studies of blocks where those holes are actually sorry it 's a little hard to see but on the surfaces you can see these red arrows on the left it 's when it 's cold and the and on the right the thermo bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through so it 's a completely different thing because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows"
