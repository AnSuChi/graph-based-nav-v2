  "transcript": "i thought a lot about the first word i 'd say today and i decided to say colombia it 's a beautiful country with extraordinary people like me and others and but we have a few problems you may have heard of some of them we have the oldest it 's been around for over fifty years which means that in my lifetime i have never lived one day of peace in my country this guerrilla and the main group is the farc guerrillas revolutionary armed forces of colombia they have financed their war by kidnapping by extortion by getting into the drug trade by illegal mining there has been 's not really good and if you look at the human cost of this war over fifty years we have had more than five point seven million displaced population it 's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world so it 's a little bit like the are now in the middle of peace talks and we 've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully and as part of that we decided to try something completely lateral and different i am going to talk about gigantic trees that we put in nine strategic pathways in the jungle covered with christmas lights these trees roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time and they had a sign beside them that said if christmas can come to the jungle you can come home demobilize at christmas everything is possible so because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas so let me take you back four years before the trees four years before the trees we were approached by the government to help them it had a political strategy but it said we don 't really have a communications strategy and it probably would be a good thing to have we decided to immediately jump into this but we didn 't know very much about it we didn 't understand in colombia if you live in the cities you 're very far away from where the war is actually happening so you don 't really understand it and we asked the government and we talked to about sixty of them before we felt we fully understood the problem we talked about they told us why they had joined the guerrillas why the left the guerrillas what their dreams were what their frustrations were and from those conversations came the underlying insight that has guided this whole campaign which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations as the people they hold hostage and we put them on the radio and television so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories this person you see here is giovanni andres giovanni andres is twenty five when we took that picture he had been seven years in the guerrilla and he had demobilized very recently he was recruited when he was seventeen and sometime later if you will this beautiful girl was recruited and they fell in love their conversations were about what their family was going to be like what their kids so one night when she was on guard she just left and she went to to the army she many many kilometers north he heard her on the radio and when he heard her on the radio he said what am i doing here i need to do the same thing did he walked for two days and two nights and he risked his life and he got out and the only thing he wanted was to see her the only thing that that was in his mind was to see her she had been but i can find out but what what i can tell you is that that our radio strategy was working the problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla it was not working with the commanders the people that are more difficult to replace because you can easily so and we even went as far as asking ex commanders of the guerrilla to fly on helicopters with microphones telling the people that used to fight with them there is a better life out there but so we were suddenly left with nothing because the guerrilla were spreading the word that all of those things are done because if they don 't do it they and somebody some brilliant person in our team came back and said you know what i noticed i noticed that around christmastime there have been peaks of demobilization since this war has started and that that was incredible because that led us to think that we needed to talk to the human being and not to the soldier we needed to step away from talking from government to and that was and that man you see there with he 's captain juan manuel valdez captain valdez was the first high ranking official to give us the helicopters and the support we needed to put these christmas trees up and he said i want to do this because makes my men feel stronger but i wanted you all to see him because he was really really important he gave us all the support to put up the first christmas trees what happened later is that the guerrillas who came out during the christmas tree operation and all of that we use rivers and we asked the people and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas we asked them can you send guerrillas a message we collected over six thousand messages some of them were notes saying get out some of them were toys some of them were candy even people took off their jewelry their little crosses and religious things and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers and we sent thousands of these down the rivers and then picked them up later if they weren 't but lots of them were picked up this generated so this was incredible and it was about come home at christmas then and when the peace process started and it changed because it makes you think well if there 's a peace process this is probably going to be over at some point i 'm going to get out and their fears were not their fears were am i going to be rejected when i get out of this am i going to be rejected so the past christmas what we did was we asked and we asked them to give us pictures of their children which is so come home i 'm waiting for you you can see the pictures here i 'll show you a couple thank you and these pictures were placed in many different places and a lot of them so we did mothers around christmastime now let 's talk about the rest of the people and you may be aware of this or not but there was a world cup this year and it was a unifying moment for colombia and what we did was tell the guerrillas jungle we 're saving a place for you so this was television this was all different types of media saying we are saving a place for you the soldier here in the commercial says i 'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the world cup ex football players radio announcers everybody was saving a place for so since we started this work a little over eight years ago seventeen thousand guerrillas have demobilized i do not thank you i don 't want to say in any way but what i do know is that our work and the work that we do may have helped a lot of them start thinking about demobilization and it may have helped a lot of them take the final decision but on behalf of all the colleagues i see here who work in advertising and of all the team that has worked with me to do this that thank you"
