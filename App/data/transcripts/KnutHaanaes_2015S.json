  "transcript": "they only do more of the same or they only do what 's new to me the real quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities exploration and exploitation but it can be too much of a good thing consider facit i 'm actually old enough to remember them and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world facit do when the electronic calculator came along they continued doing exactly the same gone to me the irony about the did too much exploitation but exploration can go wild too a few years back i worked closely alongside a european biotech company let 's call them certain forms of blood cancer and the mantra was when we only get it right or even we want it perfect the sad thing is before they became perfect even good enough enough they became obsolete i first heard about exploration and exploitation the founder of the idea is is jim march and to me the power of the idea is is its practicality exploration it 's about search it 's about discovery it 's about new products it 's about new innovations it 's about changing our frontiers our heroes are people who have done exploration and they deserve to be and we know that the risks are high exploitation is the opposite exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good better exploitation is about making our trains run on time it 's about making good products faster and cheaper exploitation is not risky and i think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same until they become obsolete or even pathetic that 's the risk of exploitation we explore small children they explore all day all day it 's about exploration we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on the same goes for companies and i hear very often questions phrased in different ways example how can i both effectively run and reinvent my company or how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis so doing one well is difficult doing both well as the same time is art pushing both exploration and exploitation so we have lots of great examples we have and the benefits are huge why is balancing so difficult i think it 's difficult because there are so many traps that keep us where we are so i 'll talk about two but there are many so instead of staying with it we create something new but the same goes for that then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated we see this in the public sector as well we all know that any kind of effective reform of but still we change much more often we really don 't give but they couldn 't see it they were simply so good at making what they loved doing that they wouldn 't change we are like that too when we know something well it 's difficult to change bill gates has said success is a lousy teacher it seduces us into thinking we cannot fail and they apply to our companies and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future but they always and i think they will always keep pushing for the next battle whatever it takes i 'll share a chart with you and i think it 's a wonderful one move ahead take a 10 year perspective on the same company i think we need to allow challenging i think the mark i think that 's also what good parenting is about maybe it 's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in rome when the generals after a big they always had a companion whispering in their ear remember you 're only human balancing exploration and exploitation and we need to be conscious looking at your own company in which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps and what can second question is when did i and what kind of effect did it have on me so let me leave you with with this whether you 're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know don 't forget the beauty is in the balance thank you"
