  "transcript": "over a million people are killed each year in disasters two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced and the communities will take twenty to thirty years to recover and billions of economic losses if you can reduce the initial response by one day you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days or three years see how that works mitigate whatever flooding danger there is that means the which then means you can restore the economy and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster and that 's why i do disaster robotics because robots can make a disaster go away faster now you 've already seen a couple of these these are the these are two types of of uavs a rotorcraft or hummingbird a fixed wing a hawk and they 're used extensively since two thousand and five hurricane katrina let me show fantastic for structural engineers being able to see damage from angles you can 't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image or anything flying at a higher angle this hawk now this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys that 's where you 're pulling imagery together and getting 3d reconstruction we used both of because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster not the search and rescue the search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing the bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders so they needed to understand what was going on driving back to arlington command post seven hours them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way and don 't just think about the uavs i mean they are sexy but remember eighty percent of the world 's population lives by water and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater the parts that we can 't get to like the bridges and things and that 's why we have unmanned marine vehicles why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very very important they get overlooked think about the japanese tsunami four hundred miles of the amount of coastland devastated by hurricane katrina in the united states so we need marine vehicles now let 's look at a viewpoint from the sarbot of what they were seeing we were working on a we were able to reopen that fishing port using her sonar in four hours that fishing port was told it was going to be six months before they could get a manual team of divers in and it was going to take the divers two weeks they were going to miss the fall fishing season which was the major economy for that part which is kind of like their and that 's because robots don 't do things that people do they go places people can 't go and a great example of that is bujold unmanned ground so bujold was used extensively at the world trade center to go through towers one two and four you 're climbing into the rubble rappelling down going deep in spaces the tracks began to melt and come off robots don 't replace people or dogs or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins the biggest problem is not making the robots smaller though it 's not making them more so wouldn 't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site so whoever 's there use their robots over let 's think about that let 's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county what are the odds that the experts your chemical engineer your railroad transportation engineers so we 're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they 're using the problem becomes who gets what data when one thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out and worse yet it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget so we need to think about those kinds of challenges so it 's the data bujold only when she was deep in the rubble because that 's what the team said they wanted we lost valuable data so the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people here 's another reason we 've learned that some some buildings things like schools hospitals city halls get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases now we 're looking if we can get the data from the robots to share not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time but now we can begin to do the response in parallel everybody can see the data we can shorten it that way so really it 's about the data applause they may be underwater because robots are coming to the rescue"
