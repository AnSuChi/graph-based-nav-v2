  "transcript": "have revolutionized our world they revealed to us a tiny world of objects life and structures that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes but instead it uses a video camera and image processing to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes so what do i mean by color changes our skin for example changes its color very slightly when the blood flows under it which is why when you look at other people when you look at the person sitting next to you you don 't see their skin or their face changing color when we look at this video of steve here it appears but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face and we can do it with regular cameras so here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby from a video we took with a regular dslr camera and the so i just took a short clip from batman begins here just to show christian bale 's pulse and you know presumably he 's wearing makeup the lighting here is kind of challenging but still just from the video so how do we do all that we basically analyze the changes and then we crank up those changes we make them bigger so that we can see them the tricky part is that those signals those changes that we 're after are extremely so we use some clever image processing techniques that actually show us those changes but also tiny motions and that 's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras so this is my daughter it 's a video i recorded about so i too got one of those and this is pretty much what you 'll see with a standard baby monitor so here i took the motions and then i could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing and it turns out there 's a lot of phenomena we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope we can see that our eyes are constantly moving in this wobbly motion and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born so you can see i wasn 't getting too much sleep maybe we could use those motions to tell us something about our thoughts we can also magnify small mechanical movements like vibrations in engines that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems or but measuring those motions is one thing and actually seeing those motions as they happen is a whole and ever since we discovered this new technology we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it it 's very simple to use it can work on your own videos our collaborators at quanta research even created this nice website where you can upload your videos and process them online so even if you don 't have any experience in computer science or programming you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope so this video was made by a youtube user called tamez85 i don 't know who that user is but he or she used our code to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy it 's kind of creepy and this youtube user claims it is the first rodent on earth that was motion magnified you can also do some art with it she made them all stand still it 's like seeing still pictures come to life but we didn 't stop we started wondering what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions that we could now use our cameras to measure and one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound sound as we all know is basically changes in air pressure that travel through the air those pressure waves hit objects and they create small but it turns out that sound also produces visual motions so here are two examples this is me demonstrating my great singing skills we can see all the motions and ripples in the neck that are involved in producing the sound that signal is there in that video so here we 're going to play a note that 's in the resonance we can very clearly see how the glass vibrates and resonates in response to the sound it but this this made us think it gave us this crazy idea can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them in this way we can turn everyday objects into microphones so here 's the sound that we played in the room there 's no chance you 'll be able to see anything going on in that video just by looking at it but here 's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing the tiny motions in that audio signals from video signals and just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer that 's one thousandth of a millimeter that 's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out just by observing how light bounces off we can recover sounds from other objects like plants had a little lamb because those those are said to be the first words that thomas edison spoke into his phonograph it was one of the first sound recording devices in history it basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil that was wrapped around the cylinder here 's a demonstration of recording and replaying sound with edison 's phonograph able to get sound in pretty much similar quality but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras so this is the sound that we were able to recover in that case laughter but it might actually be useful for other because sound can 't travel in space but light can it lets us see physical processes that we know are there but that we 've never been able to see with our own eyes until now and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions"
