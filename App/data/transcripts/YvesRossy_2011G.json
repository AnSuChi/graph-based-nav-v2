  "transcript": "because yves ' body is an integral part of the aircraft [ wind tunnel tests ] narrator yves uses his body to steer the wing he 's 's acting as a as a human fuselage so to say and that 's quite unique narrator when he arches his back he goes into a dive on it 's open he is down he 's out over the channel there is yves rossy there is no turning back now he is over the english channel and under way ladies and gentlemen a historic flight has begun and then come in for for a nice so it 's possible to fly almost like i don 't have feathers but i feel like a bird sometimes it 's really an unreal feeling because normally you have a big thing a plane around you and when i strap just this little you start to become jetman yr it was you are almost naked you take a position like that and especially when you take a tracking position you have the feeling that you you are flying and that 's the it 's very short and only in one direction so the idea but change the vector and increase the time hundred and ninety miles per hour bg what 's the weight of the equipment you 're carrying yr when i exit full of kerosene fifty five kilos on my back bg and you 're not piloting there is no handle no steering nothing it is purely your body and the wings become part of i wanted to keep this freedom of movement and it 's really like the kid playing the airplane i want to go down it 's not steering it 's i don 't do special physical training i just try to to keep my mobility through new activities last winter i began with kite surfing so new things so you have to adapt i 'm quite an experienced but this is really you need fluidity you need to be agile and also to adapt really fast bg somebody in the audience asked me how does he breathe up there because you 're going fast and you 're up at three thousand up to three thousand meters it 's not such a big problem with oxygen but for example bikers they have the same speed integral helmet it 's really no problem to breathe bg describe for me the equipment harness parachute my only instruments are an altimeter and time i know i have about eight minutes fuel so i just check before it 's finished i still have the possibility to open the second one and this is my life that 's the real important thing about safety i did use that during these last fifteen years about twenty times never with that type of wing but at the beginning of the gibraltar i but you lose orientation completely so i did try i have also an audible altimeter so i i was at my minimum altitude in that vector fast so i and then i did open my chute bg so the wings have their own parachute and you have your two parachutes yr exactly there is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons so i can repair it afterward and especially i assume you have i have no checklist for that we have a hundred years of and you can adapt really precisely with that i have to adapt to something new that means we have two engines on an airbus with only one engine you can fly so i have the approach of a professional pilot with the respect of a pioneer in front of mother nature bg it 's well said and i continue on two or three engines it 's sometimes possible it 's quite complicated to explain but according to which regime i was i can continue on two and try to get a nice place to land and then i open my parachute bg so the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off and then the landing as we have seen arriving on this so just as a curiosity where did you land when you flew over the grand canyon did you land on the rim and i came back afterward but it was too stony and full of cactus on top bg that 's exactly why i asked the question yr and also the currents are are quite so it was it was much for me to land at the bottom what 's next for you what 's next for jetman yr first to i want to share it to do formation flights and i plan to start from a cliff like catapulted from a cliff bg so instead of but with initial speed but it 's not it 's possible to start already now it 's just too dangerous and i hope it will be for everybody"
