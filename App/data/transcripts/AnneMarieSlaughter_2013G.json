  "transcript": "so my moment of truth did not come all at once in two thousand and ten i had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the u s state department this was my moment to lean in to push myself forward and i knew i could handle a bigger job the woman i thought i was i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them but deep down i knew even if i didn 't fully recognize the woman who was making that choice that was a decision based on love i couldn 't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being while my family was righting itself i started to realize that even if i could go back into government i didn 't want to i didn 't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at i finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me not what i was conditioned to want or maybe what i conditioned myself to want and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that i grew up with and have always championed i am still completely committed to the cause of but let 's think about what that equality really means and how best to achieve it i always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers so that the measure of male female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions i still think we should do everything we possibly can i suggest that real it means creating a much wider range of equally respected choices for women and for men and to get there we have to change our workplaces our policies and our culture in the workplace real equality means valuing family just as much as work and understanding that the two reinforce each other i have always acted on the mantra if family comes first work does not come second life comes and i am confident and my confidence has always been borne out that the work will get done and done better workers who have a reason to get home to care for their children or their family members are more focused more efficient more breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents he 's much more likely to bring in new clients a lot of patience resilience adaptability those are all attributes that are ever more important in a the best companies actually know this the companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the united states include some of our most successful corporations and a two thousand and eight national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work they 're more satisfied and more loyal they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health and a two thousand and twelve study of employers showed that deep flexible practices actually lowered operating costs so you may think that the privileging of work over family when my family first started going to italy we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day it 's actually just as much about embracing the warmth of a family reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24 hour competition so making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done no matter who does it think about it breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival at least if we get beyond somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones now most of you when you hear me talk about breadwinning and caregiving instinctively translate those categories into men 's work and women 's work and we don 't but consider breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities should one of them stop working or reduce hours to should they both change their practices so they can have much more flexible schedules and what criteria should they use to make that decision is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career or who has the most flexible boss the same sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women 's problems millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn and many of those workers are scrambling they 're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe breadwinning and caregiving are really equal then why shouldn 't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society the governments that get it no surprises here provide universal protections for pregnant women and care for the elderly and the disabled those governments invest breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other they routinely rank among the top fifteen countries of the most globally competitive economies but they rank higher than other governments like my own the u s or switzerland that have higher average levels of income but we 're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture and the kind of cultural change required means re socializing men increasingly in developed countries women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only but men are actually still where they always were men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners that to derive their from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder the feminist revolution still has a long way to go but sixty years after the feminine mystique was published many women actually have more choices than men do we can decide to be a breadwinner a caregiver or any combination of the two when a man on the other hand he puts his manhood on the line they 're scratching their heads isn 't the measure of a man and as many women hold that view as men do we know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career so as parents and partners we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be either caregivers or breadwinners we should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys i can almost hear lots of you thinking no way the change is actually already happening at least in the united states lots of men take pride in cooking and frankly obsess over stoves they take paternity leave when they can they can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework indeed there are male college students now who are starting to say i want to be a but they lose it if they decide not to take it a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they didn 't in fact take their leave when they had kids so i was raised to believe that championing women 's rights but i 've come to believe that we have to value family every bit as much as we value work and that we should entertain the idea that doing thirty years ago carol gilligan a wonderful psychologist studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice it you don 't care is just as much a part of who we are as that 's not fair bill gates agrees he argues that the two great forces of human nature are let 's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution as whole human beings we will be better caregivers and breadwinners but i grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual not so much the revolution for human equality it will happen how far and how fast is up to us thank you"
