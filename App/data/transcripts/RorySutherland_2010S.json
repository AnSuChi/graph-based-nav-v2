  "transcript": "may remember me from tedglobal remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me one of them was why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the eurostar train when for about ten percent you 'd still have five billion left in change and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down now according to whether you 're within or outside the speed limit those are actually more effective which is the tendency of the organization or the institution is to deploy as much force as possible as much compulsion as possible actually the tendency of the person is to be almost influenced in so what i 'm asking for is the creation of a new job title i 'll come to this a little later and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language because it does seem to me that large organizations including government which is of course the largest organization of all have actually become completely disconnected with what actually matters to people now all of you in this room in one form or other are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no doubt lucrative activity you 're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger all to anybody okay years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do the most potent things are actually very very small this is from virgin atlantic upper class it 's the cruet salt and pepper set which is i reckon i can heist these however you pick them years after you remember the strategic question of whether you 're flying in a seven hundred and seventy seven or an airbus you remember those words and that experience similarly this is from a hotel in stockholm the lydmar has anybody stayed there it 's the lift it 's a series of buttons in the lift nothing unusual about that at all except that these are actually rhythm and blues you have a series of buttons you actually choose your lift music my guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the lydmar hotel in stockholm is probably five hundred to one thousand pounds max it frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we 've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of five hundred thousand dollars in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you 've ever stayed in in in the entire course of your life and she came across a similar example of something that fascinated me as being something which in a business context or a government context would simply be so trivial a solution as to seem embarrassing it was simply to encourage the inoculation of children by not only making it a social event i think good use of behavioral economics in that if you turn up with several other mothers to have your child inoculated if you 're a senior person at unesco and someone says so what are you doing to eradicate world poverty it 's the lentils and most of all expensive solutions attached to them and yet what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there 's a very very strong disproportionality at work that actually what changes so what happens in an institution and once you have a very very large budget but no money at all laughter and they 're great and terminal five is you come out of arrive at the airport and you follow a big yellow sign that says trains and it 's in front of you so you walk for another hundred yards expecting perhaps another sign that might courteously be yellow in front of you and saying trains no no no the next one is actually blue to your left and says heathrow express i mean it could almost be rather like that scene from the film airplane a yellow sign that 's exactly what they 'll be expecting all credit to the british airport authority i spoke about this before and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said okay what can you do so i did come up with five suggestions which they are actually actioning one of them also being although logically it 's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it if it only serves two floors because when the door closes and there 's nothing for you to do you 've actually just stepped into a hammer film but the small stuff what you might call the user interface is done spectacularly badly but also there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as strategy to actually solve them i tried this exercise recently talking about banking they said can we do an advertising campaign what can we do and encourage more online banking i said it 's really really easy i said when people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they 'd probably quite like to look at the last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance i 've got friends who actually why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news and they do it three times as often let 's face it most of us how many of you actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine and you 're pretty rich by the standards of the because there 's a fundamental disconnect as i said actually the people with the power want to do big expensive things and there it 's very very important that the strategy myth is maintained because if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of but it wants it 's a kind of mechanistic world effectively it sits very nicely on spreadsheets everything is numerically expressible and the amount you spend on something is proportionate to the scale of your success that 's the world people actually want in truth we do live in a world that science can understand unfortunately the science is probably closer to being climatology in that in many cases very very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects vast areas of activity enormous mergers can actually accomplish absolutely bugger all but it 's very very uncomfortable for us to to actually acknowledge that we 're living in such a world but what i 'm saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four way approach that not denying that strategy has a role you know there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot and i 'd be wrong to wrong to dis that completely moving over we come of course to consultancy i thought i mean tiger surely was actually obeying the accenture model he developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services tied to a single monopoly provider in many cases sourcing things locally and of course the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time led for better load balancing so and the fundamental problem is we don 't actually have a word for this stuff we don 't know what to call it can have a success absolutely out of proportion to their expense their efforts and the disruption they cause so the first thing i 'd like is a competition to anybody watching this as a film is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom and the second thing i think is that the world needs to have people in charge of that that 's why i call for the chief detail officer every corporation should have one and every government should have a ministry of detail but who realize that actually you might achieve but you 'll probably achieve which is so woefully neglected at the moment might finally get the attention it deserves"
