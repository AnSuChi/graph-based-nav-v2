  "transcript": "everyone 's familiar with cancer but we don 't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease the tasmanian devil has shown us that not only so first of all what is a tasmanian devil many of you might be familiar with taz the cartoon character the one that spins around and around and around but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil and it 's the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals [ the ] and despite their ferocious there 's concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within twenty to thirty years and the reason for that is the emergence of a new disease a contagious cancer the story begins in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face however we now believe that this is the first sighting which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania the disease was first sighted in the northeast of tasmania and has spread across tasmania like a huge wave now there 's only a small part of the population which remains unaffected this disease appears first as tumors usually on the face or inside the mouth of affected tasmanian devils these tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors but inevitably these tumors progress towards being enormous ulcerating tumors like this one here this one in particular sticks in my mind because this is the first case of this disease that i saw myself and i remember the horror of seeing this little female devil with this huge ulcerating foul smelling tumor inside her mouth that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw she hadn 't eaten for days her body was riddled with secondary tumors and yet she was feeding three little baby tasmanian devils in her pouch they were too young to survive without their scientists around the world were intrigued by this cancer this infectious cancer that was spreading through the tasmanian devil population and to the aids epidemic the infectious agent of disease in this cancer is something altogether more sinister and something that we hadn 't really thought of before but in order for me to explain what that is i need to spend just a couple of minutes talking more about cancer itself cancer is a disease that affects millions of people around the world every year one in three people in this room will develop cancer at some stage in their lives i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only fourteen cancer occurs and when you have a population of cells if one of them acquires new mutations which allow them to grow more quickly acquire nutrients more successfully invade the body they 'll be selected for by evolution throw a drug at it and resistant cells will grow back an amazing fact is that given the right leads to the death of the cancer patient so cancer could be thought of as a strange but that is where the tasmanian devil cancer has acquired an absolutely amazing evolutionary adaptation and the answer came from studying the tasmanian devil cancer 's dna this was work from many people but i 'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment that i did a few years ago the he 's and being a geneticist i 'm always interested to look at dna and mutations so i took this opportunity to collect some samples from jonas ' tumor and also some samples from other parts of his body and when i looked at the sequence of the dna and compared the sequence of jonas ' tumor to that of the rest of his body i discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile in fact jonas and his tumor were as different from each other as you and the person sitting next to you what this told us was that jonas ' tumor did not arise from cells of his own body in fact more genetic profiling told us that this tumor so how come a tumor that that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas ' face we found that all of these cancers shared the same dna think about that for a minute that means that all of these cancers actually are the same cancer that arose once from one individual devil that have broken free of that first devil 's body and spread through the entire tasmanian well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild we think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor get into the saliva when the devil bites another devil it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil so the tumor continues to grow so this tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer it 's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it it spreads through the population has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system and it 's the only cancer that we know of that 's threatening an entire species with extinction well the answer is it has and if you 're squeamish please look away now he discovered this a huge bleeding tumor at the base of kimbo 's penis so is this dog cancer these same cells that are affecting kimbo here we also believe this cancer might be very old in fact genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the neanderthals this cancer is remarkable it 's the oldest mammalian derived life form that we know of it 's a living relic of the distant past could cancers be contagious between people well this is a question which fascinated chester southam a cancer doctor in the and this is a but a small number of them did and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill whose immune systems were probably compromised what this tells us ethical issues aside is that it 's probably extremely rare for cancers to be transferred between people under some circumstances it can happen and i think that this is something that oncologists and epidemiologists should be aware of in the future so just finally cancer is an inevitable outcome of the ability of our cells to divide but that does not mean that we should give up hope in the fight against cancer in fact i believe given more knowledge of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer 's growth we can defeat cancer let 's prevent the tasmanian devil from being the first animal to go extinct from cancer"
