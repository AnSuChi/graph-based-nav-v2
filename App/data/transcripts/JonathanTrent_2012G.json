  "transcript": "some years ago i set out to try to understand if there was a possibility to develop biofuels on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels but not compete with agriculture so here 's what i came up with and they produce oxygen as they grow the algae that grow are in a container that distributes the heat to the surrounding water and you can harvest them and make biofuels and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed and of course you 'd have to make a large area of this so you 'd have to worry about other stakeholders like fishermen and ships and such things but hey we 're talking about biofuels and we know the importance why are we talking about microalgae so you can see some things like soybean graph there shows what microalgae can contribute so what are microalgae microalgae are micro that is they 're extremely small as you can see here a picture of those single celled organisms compared to a human hair those small organisms have been around for millions of years and there 's thousands of different species of microalgae in the world some of which are the fastest growing plants on the planet and produce as i just showed you lots and lots of oil the reason we 're doing this offshore is because if you look at our coastal cities there isn 't a choice and if you look at where most of the waste water treatment plants are they 're embedded in the cities so but in all cases the water that 's released is perfectly adequate for growing microalgae so let 's envision what the system we put waste water and some source of and they sequester otherwise go off into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas and the temperature is controlled by the surrounding water temperature and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and and the system is contained what do i mean by that it 's modular let 's say something happens that 's totally unexpected to one of the modules it leaks it 's struck by lightning and because they 're living in waste water they 're fresh water algae the plastic we 'll build it out of is some kind of which is also going to be an issue in the future and we 're working on methods now for recovering the waste the other thing to consider is the structure itself it provides we can think in terms of how it might contribute to an aquaculture so you 're probably thinking gee this sounds like a good idea what can we do to try to see if it 's real i set up laboratories in santa cruz at the california fish and game facility we also set up experiments in san francisco at one of the three waste water treatment plants and finally we wanted to see where where we could look at what the impact of this structure would be and we set up a field site at a place called moss landing marine lab in monterey bay where we worked in a harbor to see what impact this would have on marine organisms the laboratory that we set up in santa cruz was our it was a place where we were growing algae and welding plastic and building tools and making a lot of mistakes or as edison said we were finding the ten thousand ways that the system wouldn 't work and we built tools that allowed us to get into the lives of algae so that we could monitor the way they grow what makes them happy how do we make sure that we 're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive and we had built lots and lots of designs so let me show you how the system and it circulates through this thing and there 's sunlight of course it 's at the surface and the algae grow on the nutrients but this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag the algae are not going to suffocate because of co2 as we would they suffocate because they produce and they use up all the co2 and what you see here is so we would remove the algaes that concentrated in the bottom of this column and then we could harvest that by a procedure where you float and we also looked at how seabirds and marine mammals interacted and in fact you see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting and would periodically now really what we were doing we were working in four areas our research covered the biology of the system which included studying the way algae grew but not only on the small scale but how we would build it on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required i mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals and looked at basically the environmental impact of the system and what i mean by economics is what is the energy required to run the system do you get more energy out of the system than you have to put into the system don 't have a lot of time and i 'd like to show you the artist 's conception of how this system might look if we find ourselves in a protected bay and we have in the background in this image the waste water treatment plant and a source of flue gas for the co2 unless you look at the and potentially for photovoltaic panels or wave energy or even wind energy and if you start thinking in terms of integrating all of these different activities you could also include in such a so we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture where we 're growing mussels or scallops growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food and this would be a market driver as we build the system to larger and larger scales so that it becomes plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation right now it allows us to control weeds and that when we 're finished using it in the marine environment we 'll be using it hopefully on fields here 's an image of what we could do in san and that would be about one thousand two hundred and eighty acres of these omega modules and that 's without doing anything about efficiency where else could we potentially put this system there 's lots of possibilities but the reality is as sea level rises there 's going to be lots and lots of new opportunities to consider laughter so what i 'm telling you about is a system of integrated activities biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy is integrated with aquaculture i set out to find a pathway to innovative production of sustainable and en route i discovered that what 's really required for sustainability is integration more than innovation"
