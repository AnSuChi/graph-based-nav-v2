  "transcript": "not that i 'm not afraid now but i 've learned to pretend i 've learned to be flexible in fact i 've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear let me explain back in and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy really not quite clear what all around us we had our mothers our aunts our cousins our sisters and of course the ever present media bombarding us with images and words telling us how to be now my mother was different and i just ate it up i i could draw do what i wanted to do and not have to perform not have to speak i was very shy and i could still get approval we don 't always we know there are rules out there but we don 't always know even though we are imprinted at birth with these things and we 're told what the most important color in the world is we 're told what shape we 're supposed to be in we 're told what to wear the rules that i 'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture we 're being corrected and the primary policemen are women because we are the carriers of the tradition we pass it down from from generation to generation and on top of all off these rules we don 't know what 's going on half the time so it puts us in a very tenuous position and many of us don 't i know i i still don 't even though i follow them half the time not quite aware that i 'm following them what better way than to change them [ than ] with humor it takes what we know and it twists it it takes the the codes of behavior and the codes of dress and it and we know the traditions so well we can bring a different voice to the table i grew up not far from here in washington d c during the civil rights movement the assassinations the watergate hearings and then the and i drew to try to bring my family together but i found my place and i could feel like i fit in now when i was a little older in my and then i thought in my 40s i started thinking well why don 't i do something i always loved political so why don 't i do something with the content of my cartoons to to make people think about the stupid rules that we 're following as well as laugh now my perspective is a particularly even though i 've traveled a lot i still think like but i believe that the rules that i 'm talking about are universal of course that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the u s we have now my work lately has been to collaborate with international and it 's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to and not only that it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect but through the heart my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world countries and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties and these women are and we talk about how women have such strong perceptions because of our tenuous position and we can have the great potential to be thank you"
