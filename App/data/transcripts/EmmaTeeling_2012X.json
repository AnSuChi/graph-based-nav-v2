  "transcript": "what i want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that i 'm going to describe to you the first thing i 'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to they simply will not work that 's the first thing the second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal if we study this mammal we 're going to get great insight such as blindness and deafness and the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that i fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth so are you all thinking so magnificent creature isn 't it who here thought of a bat ah i can see half the audience agrees with me and i have a lot of work to do so i have had the good fortune for the past twenty years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals and they have very unique attributes bats as we know them have been around on this planet bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment they use echolocation now what i mean by echolocation they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects and this enables them to orient in complete darkness indeed they do look very strange we 're humans we 're a visual species when scientists first realized that bats were actually we didn 't believe it we didn 't believe it now if you look indeed the very famous philosopher thomas nagel once said to truly experience an alien life form on this planet you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying echolocating bat in complete darkness and if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it so again if you just look at this you realize sound is very important for its survival however there are a group that do not use echolocation they do not perceive their environment using sound and if you just look so among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception now this is going to be important for what i 'm going to tell you later during the talk now if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you and i know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats that 's probably not that surprising and we don 't really understand them we 're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events they are the perpetrators in horror movies such as this famous nightwing also if you think about it now this is western society and what i hope to do tonight is to convince you of the chinese traditional culture culture that they perceive bats and indeed if you walk into a chinese home you may see an image such as this this is considered the five blessings the chinese word for bat sounds like the chinese word for happiness and they believe that bats bring and what i want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings so wealth and why is this and they disperse the seeds of these fruits so indeed we need them for our ecosystems it 's been estimated in the u s in a tiny colony of big brown bats that they will feed on over a million insects a year and in the united states of america right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as and scientists have estimated they 're going to they are now how can this help us and for one year in the u s inside every cell in your body lies your genome your genome is made up of your dna your dna codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome now when we 've been doing this we 've realized that there 's variations within our genome so i want you to look at the person beside you just and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation again what does it mean here what does this so if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information so how do we do this well so through natural selection over time and so therefore if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent you so if it is so in this case here it probably suggests that purple is bad this could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently so say for example the region and we find that bats that don 't see so well have the purple type we know that this is probably what 's causing so in my lab we 've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene the disease also we look at deafness there 's many underlying genetic causes for this and we have looked at genes that cause blindness so why should we be interested in aging at all well really this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the fountain of youth yet the least but we are going to have to understand it a bit better in europe alone by two thousand and fifty there is going to be a seventy percent increase of individuals over sixty five and one hundred and seventy percent increase in individuals over eighty so how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome it lived for up to typically in mammals die young think of a mouse but bats are very different and the question is how can they do that there are nineteen species of mammal that live longer than expected given their body size than man and we 're combining molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do and i believe that by studying bats we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals just imagine what that would be like"
