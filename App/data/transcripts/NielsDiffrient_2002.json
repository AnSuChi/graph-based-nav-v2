  "transcript": "now i 'm talking about the by a guy who looked like cary grant he jodhpurs an old leather jacket a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles he 'd always walk up up to his airplane in a kind of flick the cigarette away grab the girl waiting here give her a kiss maybe for the last time of course i always wondered what would happen if he 'd kissed the airplane first laughter but this was real romance to me everything about flying which was you have to stop and think for a moment so as a youngster i tried to get close to this constantly drawing airplanes it 's the way i got i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product was that airplane but it built even the parts of the airplane ze fuselage ze empanage and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing and i found that in doing the model airplanes appearance drawings were not enough you couldn 't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline you had to learn you couldn 't control it and stay so i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings the shape of the wing the shape of the fuselage and so on and build an airplane over these drawings that i knew followed some of the principles of flying and in so doing i could produce a model some of this romance that i was in love with well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering and when i was sitting in classes in which i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class one day a young man you should be in the art department and i said why and he said well for one thing there are more girls there so my romance was temporarily shifted laughter and i went into art because they appreciated drawing studied painting didn 't do very well at that went through design some architecture and for the following twenty five years i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it this sense this for the experience revolving around a designed object and it exists any of you who rode the automobiles was it yesterday at the track you know the romance revolving around well in twenty five years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call doesn 't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can and i started up a very small operation went from forty people i wanted to get back where the romance was and i couldn 't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work on the and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped so the discipline was as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body ultimately after i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane i basically engineered it and that 's the way i work now when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design you don 't start with and the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office at the work place people who worked and used task seating a great many of them sitting in front of a computer and i felt felt the one thing they don 't need is a chair that interferes so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible so my idea was that that you would sit on the chair and it would automatically balance your weight now that may not mean a lot to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow so that if you sit down on my chair whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don 't have to look for something to adjust i 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off there are drawbacks to this one is you can 't accommodate everybody there are some very light people some extremely heavy people maybe people with a lot of bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people don 't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him he said she had one of the new better chairs and the chair sank down she said oh it 's wonderful how did you do that well that 's typical of a lot of us working in chairs and why should you get a 20 page manual about how to run i had one for a wristwatch once anyway i felt that it was important that you didn 't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life but i felt was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest so i spent a long time i said i worked eight or nine years on it and i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc that is up and down so that you didn 't have to use a button and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important and the more you can recline in a way the better it is so we keep it at more or less the same level but you transfer weight off your tailbones would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone you feel that bone under there side all the weight of your upper torso your arms your head and that 's a lot of load just relieving your arms with armrests takes twenty percent of that load if your spine is not held in a good position will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload that great weight if that indeed exists when you recline you take away a lot of that load but to do that if you have any amount of recline it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always see as i recline my head says more or less vertical well if you 're reclined a great deal you have to use muscle force so that 's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to you tall guy and a short girl so i 've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother and you need it in a different position when you 're upright and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline the headrest comes up ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area right there that part of it took a long time to work out"
