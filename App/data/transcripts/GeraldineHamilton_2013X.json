  "transcript": "in our hands today and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs takes far and it fails more often than it succeeds and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them and diseases are going so for every billion dollars we spend in r & d we 're getting less drugs approved into the market less drugs but i think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work whether it has efficacy or whether it 's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical and we have two main tools available at our disposal they are cells in dishes and animal testing now let 's talk about the first one throw them in one of these dishes and expect them to work guess what they don 't well animals do and can provide extremely useful information they teach us about what happens in the complex organism we learn more about the biology itself more often than not animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they 're treated with a particular drug so we need better tools but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body bodies are dynamic environments we 're in constant motion they 're under constant so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies we need to become cell architects we need to build and engineer a home away from home for the cells and at the wyss institute we 've done just that we call it an it but it 's pretty incredible right here in my hand is a breathing living it can do a tremendous amount of things we have living cells in that little chip cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types we 're not trying to do that here we 're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies fluidic channels flexible membrane on which we can add human cells so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe and they experience them how they did in the body there and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel but what can we do with it where we add bacterial cells into the lung then we can add human white blood cells white blood cells are our body 's and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel we can actually visualize a single white blood cell and right there it 's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green in you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection it 's the way we respond but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips it tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs actually have these but mucus viruses potential allergens and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out and that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis but now with the functionality that we get in these chips we can begin to look we have a gut on a chip you can see one right and we 've put intestinal human cells this trickling flow through the cells now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome this is a disease that affects and there aren 't really many good treatments for it now the true power of this really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them there 's fluid flowing across these cells so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together now we 're really getting excited we 're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what 's going to happen in humans for example now we can begin we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs how it enters the body how it might affect change the beating of your heart does it have a toxicity we can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug this could really revolutionize and be a game changer for not only the pharmaceutical industry including the cosmetics industry we can potentially use the skin on a chip that we 're currently we could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism we could use them to learn more about such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future right now the average participant in a clinical trial is that average tends to be female yet every day we give children medications and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults children are not adults they may not respond in the same way adults do there are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead and this is the team and the people that are doing this we have engineers we have cell biologists we 're really seeing something quite incredible at the wyss institute it 's really a convergence of disciplines where biology is influencing the way we design we 're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise now let me show you our instrument this is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we 're going to require in order to link ten or more organ chips together it so a cell biologist like me can come in plug and play now let 's imagine a little bit what the future might look like if i could take your stem cells and put them on a chip now all of us in here and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs i myself a couple of years back had a really bad headache just couldn 't shake it we could imagine one day thank you"
