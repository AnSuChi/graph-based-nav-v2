  "transcript": "this summer i was back in ohio for a family wedding and when i was there there was a meet and greet with anna and elsa from these two entrepreneurs it 's great and they were not about to miss out on the opportunity that was the phenomenon and that was frozen so they get hired by a local toy call it a day it 's like santa claus without the seasonal restrictions and my niece samantha was in the thick of it she could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books as snow queen and princess ana with one n to according to my niece and the 200 plus kids in the parking lot that day this was the anna and elsa from frozen it is a blazing hot saturday morning in august in ohio we get there at ten o 'clock the scheduled start time and we are handed number fifty nine by eleven o this was going to be a while and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store so by twelve thirty we get called fifty six to sixty three please and as we walk in it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway threw up glitter on every flat surface and icicles and as we moved forward her excitement only grew and as we finally i could literally feel the excitement running through her body and let 's be honest at that point i was pretty excited too i mean the scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says hi honey you 're next to get down or you 're going to stay on your dad 's shoulders for the picture ' laughter and i was for a lack of a better word frozen it 's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question who am i millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation and there one was at the same time there 's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life so i found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in torn between two things two would i take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her that i was in fact her not her father and that she should be more careful and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides and while doing that or would i be an aunt would i brush off that comment take a million pictures and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment and by doing that walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself especially in front of my niece who was i and i had a split second to decide we are taught right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity it 's so black and white so us and them so right and wrong there is no middle there is no gray just polarity polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other which side are you on are it 's all or none you 're with us or against us that is polarity the problem with polarity and absolutes is that it eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature but if we are pulled in these two directions but it 's not really where we exist polarity is not our actual reality where do we go from there what 's at the other end of that spectrum think it 's harmonious utopia i think the opposite of polarity is duality duality is a state of having two parts but not opposition in simultaneous existence don 't think it 's possible here are the people i know and veterans who are and nra members who think i should be able to get married those are the people i know those are my friends and family that is the majority of our society that is you that is me duality is the ability to hold both things but the question is can we own our duality can we have the courage to hold both both things i work at a restaurant in town i became really good friends with the busser i was a server and we had a great relationship we had a really great time together her spanish was great because she was from mexico but significantly better than my spanish but we were united by our similarities not separated by our differences she was a devout stereotypical roles of well me but the things that bonded us so one day we were in the back scarfing down food as quickly as we could gathered around a small table during a very rare lull and a new guy from the kitchen came over who happened to be her cousin and sat down with all the bravado and machismo that his 20 year old body could hold and he said to her and his smug smile quickly dropped to one she left did the same thing it was a 10 second conversation such a short interaction and on paper she had so much more in common with him family her community was her lifeline here but her moral compass trumped all of that she didn 't have to choose some p c stance on gayness over her to choose her family over our friendship it wasn 't jesus or ash ask questions act when you hear something inappropriate actually engage i had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover or my friend or my special friend or even worse just not asked at all believe me than say nothing at all i don 't see it but i think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love it 's apathy if you don 't see my gayness then you don 't see me and the small victory i feel when i make it by and don 't have to let go the incredible cowardice and disappointment i feel when i drop it if you do not see that struggle both the good and the bad the easy and the hard and what if duality is just the first step and if we can hold two things can hold four and if we can hold four we can hold eight and if we can hold eight we can hold hundreds we are complex individuals swirls of contradiction you are all holding so many things right now what can you do to hold just a few more so back to toledo ohio i 'm at the front of the line niece on my shoulders the frazzled clerk calls me dad have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender not even that have you ever been called something you are not i am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions i break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation i feel like the entire store is staring at me and i simultaneously feel and i want to crawl under a rock and top all of that off with the frustration that i 'm wearing an purple t shirt so this whole store can see my boobs to make sure this exact same thing doesn 't happen and i hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard but i will do whatever i need to do to protect the people i love from it but then i take my niece off my shoulders and she runs to elsa and anna the thing she 's been waiting so long for and all that stuff goes away and as the thirty seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths and her humanity but thanks and i realize in that moment that i don 't have to be either an aunt or an advocate i can be both i can live in duality i can hold so many more things as my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door i turn to my sister and say was it worth it and she said are you kidding me did you see the look on her face this was the greatest day of her life it was worth the two and a half hours in the heat it was worth the coloring book that we already had a copy of it was even worth you getting called dad it actually was thank you boulder"
