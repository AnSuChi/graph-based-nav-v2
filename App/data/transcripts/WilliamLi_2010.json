  "transcript": "including cancer the revolution is called angiogenesis and it 's based on the well the human body is literally packed with them and these are the vessels of life 'll show you they can also be the vessels of death now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they 're growing in for example in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood they line air sacs for gas exchange in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles and in nerves they course along like power lines keeping those nerves alive and after injury so the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time such that need a brief burst of blood vessels the body can do this by releasing stimulators proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout when those excess vessels are no longer needed the body prunes them back to baseline using inhibitors of angiogenesis just to get back to normal levels for example after an injury where the body can 't prune back extra blood vessels or can 't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time and these situations angiogenesis is out of balance and when angiogenesis is out of balance a myriad of diseases result insufficient angiogenesis not enough blood vessels nerve damage and on the other end excessive angiogenesis too many blood vessels drives disease and we see this in and this realization is allowing us to the way that we actually approach these diseases by because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer so here we go dark gray ominous mass growing inside a brain but cancers don 't start out like this and in fact cancers don 't start out with a blood supply then they can 't get any larger because they don 't have a blood supply so they don 't have enough oxygen or nutrients in fact we 're probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about forty percent of women between the ages of forty and fifty actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts and virtually one hundred percent of us by the time we reach our 70s will have microscopic cancers growing in our most of these cancers will never become dangerous dr judah folkman who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field once called this cancer without disease when it 's working properly and this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer in fact if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells tumors simply can 't grow up and this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to being deadly cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors natural fertilizer that tip the balance in favor of blood it can invade local tissues and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases and unfortunately this late stage of cancer is the one at which it 's most likely to be when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild so if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution and it 's completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal healthy vessels we see in other places of the body and because of that they 're highly vulnerable to treatments that target them in effect when we give cancer patients an experimental drug for a glioma which is a type of brain tumor you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved and you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment well i 've just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic i asked myself can we take this one step further and treat other cancers even in other species so we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic such that we were ultimately able to extend milos survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted all with a very good quality we have about a sixty percent response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized so let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples we had it painted on top of the cancer and over the course of seven months the cancers completely disappeared and the biopsies came back as normal here 's a cancer growing on the lip of a quarter horse named guinness it so we could treat from the inside as well as guinness with his very happy owner now obviously antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers so here 's actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy or surgery but starting in two thousand and four when antiangiogenic therapies first became available you can see that there has been a seventy to one hundred percent colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors but for other tumors the improvements have only so i started asking myself why haven 't we been able to do better and as a doctor i know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage achieving a cure can be difficult if not impossible so i went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking so the cancers could never become dangerous and want to find a way to keep it from coming back so to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer and what really intrigued me was when i saw that diet accounts for thirty to thirty five percent of environmentally caused cancers but i actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking what could we be adding to our diet that 's naturally antiangiogenic and that could boost the body 's defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers in other words can we eat to starve cancer and i 'm going to show you how the farm and to the spice cabinet because what we 've discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs inhibitors of angiogenesis and we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating let me show you what happens when we put in an extract by sixty percent it potently inhibits angiogenesis we believe that and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent the blend is more potent than either one alone and here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and a few others and here are the i could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients imagine if we could create the world 's first rating system in which we could score foods according to their and that 's what we 're doing right now now i 've shown you a bunch of lab data and so the real question is what is the evidence in people well the best example i know is a study of seventy nine thousand men followed over twenty years in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a fifty percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer so this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can have an impact on cancer and we 're now studying the role of a healthy diet with dean ornish at ucsf and tufts university the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream what i 've shared with you has some check out this ad from bluecross blueshield of minnesota for many people around the world because not everybody can afford expensive end stage cancer treatments but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local sustainable antiangiogenic crops so there 's just one more disease that i have to tell you about and that 's because it turns out that adipose tissue fat is highly and like a tumor fat grows when blood vessels grow so the question is can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat like this furry tennis ball restart the treatment loses truly interesting thing about this is that we can 't take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse 's weight is supposed to be we can 't create supermodel mice and thinking what no one has thought obesity and other conditions thank you what would you recommend do you recommend pursuing these treatments now for most cancer patients and if mother nature has given us we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day jc right and along those lines for people who might have risk factors for cancer would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce wl well you know there 's abundant epidemiological evidence and i think in the information age it doesn and that 's certainly something that anybody can look into"
