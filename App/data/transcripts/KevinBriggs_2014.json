  "transcript": "i recently retired from the california highway patrol after twenty three years of service the majority of those twenty three years was spent patrolling the southern end of marin county which includes the golden gate bridge the bridge is an iconic structure unfortunately it is also a magnet for suicide being one of the most utilized sites in the world the golden gate bridge opened in one thousand nine hundred and chief engineer in charge of building the bridge was quoted as saying the bridge is practically suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable but some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension this bridge has been romanticized as such that the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief and the waters below but let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide the body strikes the water at about miles an hour some of which then puncture vital organs most die on impact those that don 't i don 't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they will face except for around the two towers there is thirty two inches of steel paralleling the bridge i can tell you from experience and at their darkest time it is very difficult to bring them back i want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day we had no formal training you struggled to funnel your way through these calls this was not only a disservice to those contemplating suicide but to the officers as well we 've come a long long way since then now veteran officers and psychologists train new officers i met jason on july twenty two of last year when i get received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the cord near i observed jason speaking to a golden gate bridge officer jason was just thirty two years old and had flown out here from new jersey he had flown out here on two other occasions from new jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge after about an hour of speaking with jason he asked us if and sent her down to earth with a box and told her never ever open that box well and she did open the box all sorts of evils against man the only good thing in the box was hope jason then asked us what happens when you open the box and hope isn 't there and was gone young man from new jersey had just committed suicide because that very next day their family rabbi called to check on me jason 's i pose these questions to you would you know what to say listen to understand because you probably don 't by just being there you may just be the turning point that they need if you think someone is suicidal 't be afraid to confront them and ask the question one way of asking them the question is like this others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life have you had these thoughts confronting the person head on may just save their life and be the turning point for believing that things are terrible and never going to get better and i received an email from a lady that i 'd like to read you her letter she lost her son on january nineteen and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago and it 's with her permission and blessing that i read this to you i imagine you 're at the ted conference i 'm thinking i should go walk the bridge this weekend but noticing more moments of really realizing mike isn 't coming home the next came to my home and reported that mike 's car was down at the bridge a witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at one thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves who hasn 't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness it shouldn 't be so easy to end it my prayers are with you for your fight the ggb golden gate bridge is supposed to be a passage across good luck this week i can 't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day and also the courage just to carry on i 'd like to introduce you to a man i refer to as hope and courage on march eleven of two thousand and five i i rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man kevin berthia standing on the sidewalk he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower for the next hour and a half i listened i congratulated him this is a new beginning a new life was it that made you come back and you just listened and i have that letter with me and i 'd like to read it to you i adopted kevin when he was only six months old now we know we truly thank god for you sincerely indebted to you and on the bottom she writes p s when i visited san francisco general hospital that evening you were listed as the patient that one out he speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others suicide is not just something i 've encountered on the job it 's personal grandfather committed suicide by poisoning although ending his own pain robbed me from ever getting to know him this is what suicide does for most suicidal folks or those contemplating suicide they wouldn 't think of hurting another person they just want their own pain to end drugs or alcohol or death i 've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge of those incidents i 've been directly involved with but that 's two too many he shook my hand on three occasions and he said kevin i 'm sorry the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge additionally that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it that one to two percent most of those folks have said that the second i tell people the bridge but people together also that we make is something that each and every one of us should strive to do thank you very much"
