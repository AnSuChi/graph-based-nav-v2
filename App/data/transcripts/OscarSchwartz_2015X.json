  "transcript": "can a computer write poetry what is poetry but these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer not in a single ted talk we have two poems and the other one 's written by a computer hands up if you think poem one was written by a human very brave of you because the first one was written by the human poet william blake the second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically according to again you haven 't got ages to read this so just trust your gut so if you think the first poem was written by a human put your hand up and if you think the second poem was written by a human put your hand up we have more or less a fifty fifty split here it was much harder the answer is the first poem was generated by an algorithm called was created back in the and the second poem was written by a guy called frank o 'hara who happens to be one of my favorite human poets the turing test was first proposed by this guy alan in order to answer the question can computers think with such proficiency such that the human couldn 't tell whether they are talking it 's the game we just played you 're presented with a poem you don 't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess well turing said that if a computer could fool a human thirty percent of the time that it was a human well yes absolutely it can but if you 're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer that 's ok if you 're having a bunch of gut reactions to it that 's also again you 're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human whoa that 's a lot more people so you 'd be surprised to find that poem one was written by the very human poet gertrude stein and poem two was generated by an algorithm called rkcp works so rkcp is an algorithm designed by ray kurzweil who 's a director of engineering at google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence a source text so in the poem we just saw before poem two the one that you all thought was human it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called emily dickinson it looked at the way she used language learned the model and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure but the important thing to know about rkcp is that it doesn 't know the meaning of the words it 's using it 's able to create a poem that seems more human than gertrude stein 's poem and gertrude so according to the logic of the reverse turing test gertrude stein is a computer feeling confused i think that 's fair enough but we also have perhaps most confusingly so what do we take from all or that gertrude stein is more of a computer than william blake so my first insight is that so that when we ask can a computer write poetry we 're also asking what does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category how do we say who or what can be part of this category i believe and it can 't be answered with a yes or no test we 're not really testing the they 're pretty simple and have existed more or less what we are doing with the turing test for poetry rather so what i 've figured out we 've seen this when earlier today that william blake is more of a human than gertrude stein it simply means that the category of the human is unstable this has led me to understand rather it is something that 's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time so my final insight works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it we show it william blake that 's what it reflects back more than any other bit of technology the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it and much of the conversation is can we build it can we build an intelligent computer but what we 've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact that it so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future we shouldn 't only be asking ourselves can we build it but we should also be asking ourselves what idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us but i think requires a moment of"
