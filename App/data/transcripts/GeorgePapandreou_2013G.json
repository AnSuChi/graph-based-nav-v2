  "transcript": "this will not be a speech like any one i have ever given i will talk to you today about the failure of leadership in global politics and i won 't provide some but i will in the end urge you to rethink actually take risks and get involved in what i see as a global evolution of democracy failure of leadership what is the failure of leadership today i believe that the failure of leadership is the fact that we have taken so let me from my personal experiences give you so that you can step back and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope with the challenges of today and why politics is going let 's start from the beginning let 's start from a discovery that to be masters of our and democracy was the political innovation which protected this freedom because we were liberated from fear so that our minds in fact whether they be despots or dogmas could be the protagonists democracy was the political innovation that allowed us to limit the power whether it was of tyrants or of high priests well i first began to understand this when i was fourteen years old i used to to try to avoid homework sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly you see then greece was under control of a very powerful and my father was heading a promising movement to reimagine greece to imagine a greece where freedom reigned and where maybe the people the citizens could actually rule i used to join him in many of the campaigns and you can see me here next to him i 'm the younger one there to the side you may not recognize me because i used to part my hair differently there elections were coming things were going well in the campaign the house was electric we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece one night military trucks drive up to our house soldiers storm the door they find me up on the top terrace a sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun puts it to my head and says tell me where your father is or i will kill you and was summarily but democracy did not seven brutal years of dictatorship which we spent in exile now sunday evening but i had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth that our deficit was not six percent as had been officially reported only a few days earlier before the elections by the previous government but actually fifteen point six percent but the deficit was only the symptom of much deeper problems that greece was facing and a mission actually to tackle these problems whether it was lack of transparency and accountability in governance or whether it was a clientelistic state offering favors to the powerful tax avoidance abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system the markets mistrusted us our borrowing costs were skyrocketing and we were facing possible default so i went to brussels on a mission to make the case for a united european response one that would calm the markets and give us the time to make the necessary reforms but time we didn 't get negotiations are difficult the tensions are high progress is slow and then ten minutes to two a prime minister shouts out we have to these are important decisions let 's deliberate a little bit longer another prime minister comes in and says no we have to have an agreement now because in ten minutes the markets are opening up in japan and there will be havoc in the global economy we quickly came to a decision in those ten minutes this time it was not the military but the markets that put a gun to our collective heads often on those not to blame for the crisis with these sacrifices greece did avoid bankruptcy and the eurozone avoided but i think today that most would agree that greece was only a symptom of much deeper vulnerabilities of our democracies trapped by systems too big to fail or more accurately too big to control evade environmental or labor standards our democracies are undermined by the growing inequality and the growing concentration of power and wealth the speed of the markets or simply the fact that your potential in finding solutions a preview of what is in store for us all i overly optimistically had hoped that this crisis instead i had a very humbling experience in brussels when we tried desperately again and again to find common solutions i realized that not one not one of us but worse we were trapped by our collective ignorance we were led by our fears and our fears led to a blind faith instead of reaching out to the common or the collective wisdom in our and then we were surprised when every ad hoc new measure didn 't bring an end to the crisis and of course that made it very easy to look for a whipping boy for our collective european failure and of course a convenient but unfounded stereotype that sometimes hurt but let me warn you this is not just about greece this could be the pattern that leaders follow again and again when we deal with these complex problems whether it 's climate change whether it 's migration whether it 's the financial system taking our citizens out of the process rather than building the process around and doing so will only test the faith of our citizens of our peoples even more in the democratic process it 's no wonder that many political leaders and i don 't exclude myself have lost the trust a scene which is increasingly common around the world then there 's something deeply wrong with our democracies that 's why i called for a referendum to have the greek people own and decide on the terms of the rescue package my european counterparts some of them at least said you can 't do this there will be havoc in the markets again i said we need to before we restore confidence in the markets we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people but we remain challenged 60 percent youth unemployment in greece and in other countries certainly is a lack of imagination if not a lack of compassion a green stimulus for green jobs or mutualized debt eurobonds which would support countries in need from yet i have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one let 's throw democracy at the problem believed in the wisdom of the crowd at their best moments in people we trust democracy could not work without the citizens average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries to theater research philosophy games of the mind and the body they were daily exercises actually they were an education for and those who shunned politics well they were idiots you see in ancient greece in ancient athens that term originated there idiot comes from the root idio oneself a excluded someone who doesn 't participate or even examine and participation took place in the agora the agora having two meanings both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation above markets was the direct rule of the people today we have globalized the markets so our politicians are limited while our citizens even though they see a great potential are prey to forces beyond their control so how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora how do we democratize globalization and i 'm not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g20 i 'm talking about how do we secure the space the demos the platform of values so that we can tap into your potential well this is exactly where i think europe fits in europe despite its recent failures is the world 's most successful cross border peace experiment so let 's see if it can 't be an experiment let 's see if we can 't design a european agora not simply for products and services but for our citizens where they can work together deliberate learn from each other exchange between art and cultures where they can come up let 's imagine that european citizens actually have the power to vote directly for a european president or citizen juries chosen by lottery which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues a european wide referendum where our citizens as the lawmakers vote on future treaties and here 's an idea why not have the first truly european citizens by giving our immigrants not greek or german or swedish citizenship but and make sure we actually empower the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship where they can choose to study anywhere in europe where our common identity is democracy where our education is through participation and where participation builds trust a europe an experiment in deepening and widening democracy beyond borders i am also a pragmatist and i know things must change we must revive politics as the power to imagine reimagine and redesign the revival of democratic politics will come from everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas whether it 's here in this room or just outside this room everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality technocracy rather than plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few it is in their interest let 's not be thank you you seem to describe a political leadership that is kind of unprepared and a help us understand how you felt after the decision it was not a good decision clearly but how do you feel after that not as the prime minister but as george obviously there were constraints which didn 't allow and that hurt that hurt because that first but i think this is one of our problems when we face these crises we have kept the potential the huge potential of our society out of this process and we are closing in on ourselves in politics and i think we need to to change that to really find new participatory ways using the great capabilities that now exist even in technology but not only in technology the minds that we have and that is not to be an easy discourse right now in most european countries it 's rather the other way more closed borders and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out of some of the different parts of the european construction i think one of the worst things that happened during this crisis is that we started a blame game and and the the we have less the potential to convince our citizens that we should work together while now is the time when we really need to bring our powers together more europe for me is not simply giving more power to brussels it is actually giving more power to the citizens of europe that is so that i think would be a way to answer some of the fears that we have in our society bg george thank you for coming to ted"
