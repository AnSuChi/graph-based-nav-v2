  "transcript": "waking up with abraham lincoln in the morning thinking of franklin roosevelt when i went to bed at night but when i try and think about what i 've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that i took when i was a graduate student at harvard with the great psychologist erik erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms work love and play is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only so since i tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i 've studied to illustrate this point abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson as for that first sphere of work he had a huge ambition but it wasn 't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it he somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or aesop 's fables he was so excited he couldn 't sleep he couldn 't eat though he never would travel to europe he went with shakespeare 's kings to merry england he went with lord byron 's poetry to spain and portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old his only sister sarah in childbirth a few years later and his first love ann rutledge at the age of twenty two moreover when his mother lay dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld she simply said to him abraham i 'm going away from you and i shall never return as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient greek notion but followed by other cultures as well and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with mary todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend joshua speed was leaving illinois to go back to kentucky because speed 's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal and his great friend speed went to his side and said lincoln you must rally or you will die but i 've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that i have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in congress he then ran twice for the senate lost twice everyone is broken by life ernest hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought he 'll look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril i need them by my side but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out but it soon became clear that abraham lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team rsum for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples ' point of view he repaired injured feelings that assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in two thousand and eight he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions and with a beauty of language almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in one thousand eight hundred and sixty three when the emancipation proclamation was signed he brought his old friend joshua speed back to the white house and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said i believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized but if i sign with a shaking hand i was so thrilled to find an interview with the great russian writer leo tolstoy in a new york newspaper in the early 1900s and in it tolstoy told of a trip that he 'd recently made to a very remote area of the caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of russia so he said i told them about napoleon and alexander the great and frederick the great and julius caesar and they loved it but before i finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said ' but wait you haven 't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called america which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of abraham lincoln ' he was stunned he told them everything he could about lincoln and then in the interview he said what made lincoln so great not as great a general as napoleon not as great a statesman as frederick the great but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told but of love encompassing takes work and commitment the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life when i helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level i was selected as a white house fellow when i was twenty four years old we had a big dance at the white house but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people i 'd been active in the anti vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house theme of the article was how to remove lyndon johnson from power so i was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprisingly he said oh bring her down here for a year and if i can 't win her over no one can so i did end up working for him in the white house eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he 'd chosen me to spend so many hours with i like to believe it was because i was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which i later discovered which is that half of them weren 't true but they were great nonetheless but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so i constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when i didn 't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out and then he said you remind me of my mother but i must say the older i 've gotten the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man a victor in a thousand medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in vietnam but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface lyndon johnson should have had everything in the world to to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted he owned a spacious ranch he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it in those last years he said he was so so sad watching the american people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned i 've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy enough so that a hobby so deep for instance was abraham lincoln 's love of shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down and a shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in hal 's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that lyndon johnson never could enjoy was a love of somehow humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they 're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite and as lincoln told the story mr allen went to britain after the war and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all you see george washington in there oh yes he said perfectly appropriate place for him what do you mean they said well he said there 's nothing to make an englishman shit faster than the sight of general george washington so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting and he had hundreds of these stories you so between his nightly treks to the theater his and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life i shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when i was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in new york during the day i could record for him the history of that afternoon 's brooklyn dodgers game i was telling him a fabulous story it makes you think there 's something magic about history to keep your father 's attention in fact i 'm convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first i 'd be so excited i would blurt out the dodgers won or the dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away and i was so excited first person i 'd ever see outside of ebbets field but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church when you are brought up as a catholic you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church you 'll be struck dead at the threshold so i went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said don 't worry he 's speaking in a parish hall we 're sitting in folding chairs he 's talking about sportsmanship it 's not a sin i was certain that somehow i 'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella so i had this sin on my soul when i went to my first confession i told the priest right away he said but then unfortunately he said and what else my child and then came my second sin i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church wishing harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said to whom did you wish harm and i had to say that i wished that various new york yankees players would break arms legs and ankles so he said look i 'll tell you something i love the brooklyn dodgers as you do but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely you do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen oh yes i said but luckily my first confession priest though my father died of a sudden heart attack when i was still in my 20s before i had gotten married and had my three sons i have passed his memory as well as his love of baseball even now when i sit with my sons with our season tickets i can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below jackie robinson campanella pee wee reese and duke snider i shall always be grateful for"
