  "transcript": "my name is harry baker harry baker is my name if your name was harry baker then our names would be the same realizes all his hair is on one side of his head takes just under a minute to work out that its because of the way that he slept he finds some clothes and gets dressed now sixty was beautiful with perfectly trimmed cuticles dressed in something suitable never rude or crude at all unimprovable right on time as usual more on cue than a snooker ball but to play it super cool he thought of her every second every minute every hour but he knew it wouldnt work hed never get the girl because although she lived across the street they came from different and though at the time he felt stupid and dumb for trying to love a girl controlled by her and youre left with the one sure enough after two months of moping around sixty one days later sixty one was who he found he had lost his keys and his parents were out so one day after school he went into a house as he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door he wondered why hed never introduced himself before as she let him in his jaw dropped in awe sixty one was like sixty but a little bit more laughter she had prettier eyes and an approachable smile and he liked her he reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her and it was different this time i mean this girl was wicked so he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits she said come over to mine she said sure she loved talking to someone just as quirky she agreed to this unofficial first date in the end he was only ready one minute early but it didnt matter because she arrived one minute late and from that moment on there was nonstop chatter how they loved x factor how they had two factors how that did not matter distinctiveness made one of a kind girl in his life he told her the very definition of being prime was that with only one and himself could his heart divide and she was the one he wanted to give his heart to she said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true because that wasn 't real love that love was just a sample when it came to real love they were a prime example and i became a prime number themed poetry competition winner or as i like to call it a prime minister if you don 't know what a poetry slam is it was a format come up with in america thirty years ago as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events by putting an exciting word like slam on the end and and they would end up with a numerical score and what this meant it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience and and encouraged the kind of connection with the listener and what it also means is is you can win and if you win a poetry slam you can call yourself a slam champion and if you lose a poetry slam you can say a subjective art form you can 't put numbers on such things but i loved it and i got involved slam champion and got invited to the poetry world cup which was unbelievable it was people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five french strangers and and i 've been able to travel the world since doing it but it also means that this next piece is so this is paper people i 'd like some paper people theyd be purple paper people maybe pop up purple paper people proper pop up purple paper how do you prop up pop up purple paper people i hear you cry because and a little paper you and we could watch paper tv and it would all be see the poppy paper rappers rap about their paper package or watch paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the a4 paper be a paper princess kate but wed all stare at paper pippa and then wed all live in fear of killer jack the paper ripper and a little paper you and in a pop up population peoples problems pop up too thered be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch and who ignored the people protests about all the paper cuts then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces by the confetti cannons manned by pre emptive police and yes and the paper piggy bankers pocketing more than they need purchasing the potpourri to pepper their paper properties others live in poverty and aint acknowledged properly a proper poor economy where so many are proper poor but while their needs are ignored the money goes to big wars origami armies unfold plans for paper planes and we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains but the greater shame shame is that it always seems to stay the same what changes is whos in power choosing how to lay the blame theyre naming names forgetting these are names of people i like people ' cause even when the situations dire it is only ever people who are able to inspire and on paper but in the bottom of pandoras box theres still hope and i still hope i believe in people people like my grandparents who every single day since i was born have taken time out of their morning to pray for me thats seven thousand eight hundred and ninety two days straight of someone checking im okay and thats amazing people like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners people who are capable of genuine forgiveness the persecuted palestinians people who go out of their way to make your life better and expect nothing in return you see people have potential to be powerful and a paper population is no different and a little paper you and in a pop up population people 's problems pop up too but even if the whole world fell apart then wed still make it through got time for one more for me poetry has been the ultimate way of ideas without frontiers when i first started the people who inspired me were the ones with the amazing stories and so it 's amazing to be here in front of you today thank you for being here if you weren 't here it would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday this is more fun so this last one is called the sunshine kid thank you very much for listening old man sunshine was proud of his sun and it brightened his day to see his little boy run not because of what hed done nor the problems overcome but that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one it hadnt always been like this thered been times when hed tried to hide his brightness if we go back to when he was born in a nebula we know that he never was thought of as regular because he had a flair about him to say the midas touch is wrong but all he went near seemed to turn a little bronze yes this sun was loved by some more than others it was a case of joseph and his dreamcoat and his brothers because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons and jealousy created enemies in those he outshone such as the shadow people now the shadow people didnt like the sunshine kid because he showed up the dark things the shadow people did and when he shone he showed the places where the shadow people hid so the shadow people had an evil plan to get rid of him first up shooting his dreams from the sky their words were gunshots designed to remind him he wasnt very cool and he didnt fit in with any popular kids at school they said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to earth essentially he came from nothing and was worth hed never get to go to university to learn only degrees hed ever show would be the first degree burns from those that came too close they told him he was too bright thats why no one ever looked him in the eyes his judgment became clouded with a warm and inside he burned savagely hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities and as his heart hardened his spark darkened so he let his light be eclipsed by what he fell into a lone star state like texas and felt like hed been punched in his solar plexus but thats when little miss sunshine came along singing her favorite song about how were made to be strong and you dont have to be wrong to belong just be true to who you are because we are all stars at heart little miss sunshine was hot stuff the kind of girl when you looked at her you forgot stuff was no forgetting her the minute he saw her her image burned in his retina she was out of this world and she accepted him something about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him things werent as dark as they seemed and he dared to dream shadows were nowhere to be seen when she was there he beamed his eyes would light up in ways that cant be faked when she grinned her rays erased the razor tipped words of hate they gave each other nicknames they were cool star and fun sun and gradually the shadowy damage became undone she was one in a septillion and she was brilliant could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion loved by billions from chileans to brazilians and taught the sunshine kid the meaning of resilience she said all the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle so how the hell can they handle your light only you and if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains and let the sun shine through the hurting and inside he burned savagely fueled by the fire inspired across galaxies by the girl who showed him belief"
