  "transcript": "to do is say thank you to all of you the second thing i want to do is introduce my co author and dear friend and co teacher ken and i have been working together for almost forty years that 's ken sharpe over there among many people certainly me and most of the people i talk to a kind of collective dissatisfaction with the way things are working with the way our institutions run our kids ' teachers seem to be failing them and we certainly can 't trust the brokers and even as we do our own work all too often we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing or the required thing or the profitable thing so everywhere we look pretty much across the board we we worry that they don 't know us well enough to figure out what they need to do in order to allow us to to secure those interests they don 't understand us they don 't have the time to get to know us there are two kinds of responses that we make to this sort of general dissatisfaction give teachers scripts so even if they don 't know what they 're doing and don 't care about the welfare of our kids as long as they follow the scripts our kids will get educated give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes so that you don 't need to rely on judges using their judgment instead all they have to do is look up on the list what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime impose limits on what credit card companies can charge in interest and on what they can charge in fees more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with or let 's see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that even if the people we deal with don 't particularly want to serve our interests it is in their interest to serve our interest the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing so we offer teachers bonuses if the kids they teach score passing grades on these big test scores that are used to evaluate the quality of school systems rules and incentives sticks and carrots we passed a bunch of rules to regulate the financial industry in response to the recent collapse there 's the dodd frank act there 's the new consumer financial protection agency that is temporarily being headed the way these financial services companies behave we 'll see in addition we are struggling to find some way to create incentives for people in the financial services industry that will have them more interested in serving the long term interests even of their own companies and ken [ sharpe ] and i certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers if there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse it is no matter how detailed no matter how specific no matter how carefully monitored and enforced there is no set of rules that will get us what we need you design a set of rules that will make sure that the particular reason why the financial system almost collapse can 't happen again it is naive beyond description to think that having blocked this source of financial collapse you have blocked all possible ourselves against that we need character we need people who want to do the right thing and in particular the virtue that we need most of all is the virtue that aristotle called practical wisdom practical wisdom is the moral will and he was impressed at how they would improvise novel solutions to novel and they need to measure out round columns well if you think about it it 's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler so what do they do they fashion a novel solution to the problem they created a ruler that bends what we would call these days a tape measure they appreciated that sometimes to design rounded columns you need to bend the rule and aristotle said often in dealing with other people we need to bend the rules dealing with other people demands a kind of flexibility that no set of rules can encompass wise people know how to improvise the way my co author ken and i talk about it they are kind of like jazz musicians the rules are like the notes on the page and that gets you started so for aristotle the kind of moral craftsman and in interactions with people almost all the time it is this kind of flexibility that is required a wise person knows when to bend the rules a wise person knows when to improvise and most important rule bending in the service of the right aims if you are a rule bender and an improviser so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in and so the will to do the right thing is just as important as the moral skill of improvisation and the master virtue so i 'll give you an example of wise practice in action it 's the case of michael he had a pretty low wage job he was supporting his wife and a child and the child was going to parochial school then he lost his and he robbed a cab driver it was a toy gun the pennsylvania sentencing guidelines required a minimum sentence for a crime like this of the judge on the case judge lois forer thought that this made no sense he had never committed a crime before he had been faced with desperate circumstances all this would do is wreck a family and so she improvised a sentence eleven months and not only that but release every day to go to work he did he served out his sentence he made restitution and found himself a new job and the family was united and it seemed on the road to some sort of a decent life a happy ending to a story involving wise improvisation from a wise judge but it turned out the prosecutor was not happy he did after all have a toy gun the mandatory minimum sentence for he won the appeal michael was sentenced to five years in prison judge forer had to follow the law and by the way this appeal went through after he had finished serving his sentence so he was out and working judge forer did what she was required to do and then she quit the bench and michael so that is an example both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom by rules that are meant of course to make things better now consider ms a teacher in a texas elementary school she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests all these schools in texas compete with one another to achieve these milestones and there are bonuses and various other treats that come so here was the consultant first don 't waste your time on kids who are going to pass the test no matter what you do don 't waste your time on kids who can 't pass the test no matter what you do third don 't waste your time on kids who moved into the district focus all of your time and attention on the kids who are on the bubble the so called bubble kids kids where your intervention can get them just maybe over the line from failing to passing so ms dewey heard this and she shook her head in despair while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other like they were about to go play a football game for ms dewey this isn 't why she became a teacher now ken and i are not naive and we understand that you need to have rules but the problem with relying on rules and incentives is that they demoralize first they demoralize the people who are engaged in the activity it creates when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing it creates people who are addicted to incentives that is to say it creates people who only do things for incentives psychologists have known about the they stop caring about the drawing and care about the reward if you reward kids for reading books they stop caring about what 's in the books and only care about how long they are if you reward teachers for kids ' test scores they stop caring about educating and only care about test preparation if you were to reward doctors for doing more procedures which is the current system they would do more if instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures they will do fewer what we want of course is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures and do the right amount for the right reason namely to serve the welfare and it 's time for policymakers to start paying attention and it doesn 't have to be this way we think ken and i that there are real sources of hope we identify one set of people in all of these practices who we call canny outlaws these are people who so there are teachers but they follow the scripts at double time and squirrel away little bits of extra time so these are little ordinary and they 're incredibly admirable so canny outlaws are better than nothing but it 's hard to imagine any canny outlaw sustaining that for an indefinite period of time more hopeful are people we call these are people who are looking not dodge the system 's rules and regulations but to transform the system and we talk about several one in particular is a judge named robert russell and one day he was faced with the case of gary pettengill 23 year old vet that forced him to take a medical discharge and he had started using marijuana to ease some of the symptoms so he started selling marijuana he was busted in a drug sweep his family was kicked out of their ' court in the veterans court this was the first of its kind in the united states judge russell created the veterans ' court it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law and he had created it exactly because mandatory sentencing laws were taking the judgment out of judging no one wanted non violent offenders and especially non violent offenders who were veterans to boot to be thrown into prison they wanted to do something about what we all know namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system tried to get inside their problems tried to fashion responses to their crimes that helped them to rehabilitate themselves and didn 't forget about them once the judgment was made stayed with them followed up on them made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump there are now twenty two cities that have veterans ' courts like this why has the idea spread well one reason is that and out of one hundred and eight anyone would so here 's is a system changer and it seems to be catching there 's a banker community bank that encouraged bankers i know this is hard to believe encouraged bankers who worked there to do well the bank helped finance the rebuilding of what was otherwise a dying community the bank was profitable they made sure that their loan recipients were banking hasn 't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers even goldman sachs before it turned into an institution that serves only itself so there are examples like this in medicine so that you don 't get a kind of ethical erosion and loss of empathy which characterizes most medical students in the course of their medical training and the way they do it is to give third year medical students patients who and they 're not diseases they 're people people with lives and in order to be an effective doctor you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease in addition to which there 's an enormous amount of back and forth mentoring of one student by another of all the students by the doctors and the result is a generation we hope of doctors who do have time so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about each of them shows that it is possible to build on and nurture character and keep a profession true to its proper mission and ken and i believe that this is what practitioners actually want people want they don 't want to feel like they need to take a shower to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday when they come home from work and there 's now a lot of research being done in psychology on what makes people happy and the two things that jump out in study after study i know this will come as a shock to all of you the two things that matter most to happiness are love and work love managing successfully relations with the people who are close to you and with the communities of which you are a part engaging in activities that are meaningful and satisfying if you have that good close relations with other people work that 's meaningful and fulfilling you don 't much need anything else well to love well and to work well you need wisdom rules and incentives don 't tell you how to be a good friend how to be a good parent how to be a good spouse or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher and so practical wisdom does not require heroic acts of on the part of in giving us the will and the skill to do the right thing to do right by others practical wisdom also gives us the will and the skill to do right by ourselves thanks"
