  "transcript": "they want what we want both in the scale and the scope of it no electricity and that 's really what i see all over the world i 'm startled by all the things that they don 't have but i am surprised by one thing that they do have and so when i come back from these and i 'm flying home and i 'm thinking we 're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations we still have a lot to learn it 's staggering if you think about well if we 're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we 're set as a world we need to learn from the innovators and those innovators come i feel that if we can understand what makes something like coca cola ubiquitous we can apply those lessons then for the public good coke 's success is relevant because if we can analyze it learn from it then we can save lives so that 's why i took a bit of time to study coke and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca cola they tap into local entrepreneurial talent now coke has a very clear bottom line they report set of shareholders they have to turn a profit so they take the data and they use it to measure progress they have this very continuous feedback loop they learn something they put it back start to drop then the person can identify the problem and address the issue let 's contrast that for a minute to development in development the evaluation comes at the very end and by then it is way too late to use the data i had somebody from an ngo once describe it 's dark you can 't see which one goes down until the lights come on and then you an see your impact so what 's the second thing that coke 's good at they 're good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent coke 's been in africa since buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these giving them small loans they set them up as what they called centers and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product there are now some three thousand of these centers employing about fifteen thousand people in africa in tanzania and uganda represent ninety percent of coke 's sales let 's look at the development side what is it that governments and and ngos can learn from coke governments and and ngos need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well because the locals know how to reach the very hard to serve places their neighbors and they know what motivates them to make change i think a great example of this is ethiopia 's new health extension program the government noticed in ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic they were over a day 's travel away from a health clinic so if you 're in an emergency situation or if you 're a mom about to deliver a baby forget it to get to the health care center they decided they trained thirty five thousand health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people in just five years their ratio went from one worker for every thirty thousand people five hundred people now think about how this can change people 's lives whether it 's family planning prenatal care immunizations for the children or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on time delivery and it 's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down twenty five percent from two thousand to two thousand and eight so what 's the next step for ethiopia well they 're already starting talk about this they 're starting to talk about how do you have the health community workers generate their own how do you incent them based on the impact that they 're getting out in those remote villages that 's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people 's potential the third component of coke 's success is marketing ultimately coke 's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a now the reason these micro entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow so they rely on coca cola in terms of its marketing and what 's the secret to their marketing well it 's aspirational it is associated that product with a kind of life they take a very local approach coke 's global campaign slogan is open happiness but they localize it they associate happiness with seriti or community respect now played itself out in the world cup campaign let 's listen to this song that coke created for it wavin ' flag by a somali hip hop artist it feels pretty good right and it went number one on the pop chart in seventeen countries that same appeal of celebration and unity it 's based on avoidance not aspirations i 'm sure you 've heard some of these messages use a condom don 't get aids wash you hands you might not get diarrhea it doesn 't sound anything like wavin ' flag to me and i think we make a fundamental mistake we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation but there 's a solution you build a toilet but what we 're finding around the world over and over again is if you build a toilet and you leave it there it doesn 't get used people reuse it for a slab for their home they sometimes store grain in it i 've even seen it used for a chicken coop well you work with the community you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn 't be done in the village and they agree to that take the toilet and you position it as a modern trendy convenience and it works look at these headlines women are refusing take a look at this this is a room full of young men and my husband bill and can you guess what the young men waiting to be circumcised can you you believe that we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by sixty percent in men bill and i were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying but who 's going to volunteer for this procedure but it turns out the men do because they 're hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it and the men also believe it improves their sex life so if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development we can change communities and we can change whole nations well why is all of this so important so let 's talk about what happens when this all comes together when you tie the three and polio i think is one of the most powerful examples so if you look back to one thousand nine hundred and eighty eight there are about three hundred and fifty thousand cases of polio on the planet that year in two thousand and nine we 're down to one thousand six hundred cases well how did that happen but they have but let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you let me tell you the story of shriram an eighteen month boy in bihar a northern state in india this year on august 8th he felt paralysis and by the 25th of august it was confirmed he had type one polio by august 30th a genetic test was done and we knew what strain of polio shriram had now it could have come from one of two places it could have come from nepal just to the north across the border or from jharkhand a state just to the so what 's the endgame well on september 4th there was a huge mop up campaign which is what you do in polio they went out and where shriram lives they vaccinated two million people and i 'm happy to say only one it 's not the marketing on the ground it 's not telling the parents if you see paralysis take your child to the or get your child vaccinated but we 're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren 't willing to fund polio any longer so by next summer we 're sighted to run out of money on polio of the way there and i think that if the marketing were more aspirational if we could focus as a community on how far we 've come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us and if we could do that we could stop vaccinating all of our countries for polio and it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet so if coke 's marketers came to me and asked me i 'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms to me that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as"
