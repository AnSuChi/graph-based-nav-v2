  "transcript": "say about film making is about this film in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we 've heard here michael moschen and some of the talks about music and that music exists in time a film also exists in time it 's an experience you should go through emotionally and in making this film i felt that so many of the documentaries i 've seen were all about so instead of doing the talking head thing instead it 's composed of scenes and we meet people along the way we only meet them once they don 't come back several it 's something like life that once you get in it you can 't get out there are two clips i want to show you the first one is it 's not the way they occur in the film because they are part of much and that ends with a little clip of my father of lou i think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental and perhaps not planned at all and those three clips will be followed by a scene of he built the and i think you 'll enjoy this building it 's never been seen so you 'll see images of this remarkable building it was built entirely by hand off bamboo he died in and that really struck me about about my father in the sense that he had such belief that somehow doing these things giving in the way that he gave that something good would come out of it even in the middle of a war there was a war with pakistan at one point and the construction stopped totally and he kept working because he felt well when the war is done they 'll need this building so those are the two clips i 'm going to show roll that tape richard saul wurman i remember and i came home and i said to my father because he 's really an amazing man when he was in rome moshe safdie he was a real nomad and you know when i knew him when i was in the office he would come in from a trip and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely and he would pack up and go you know he 'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him i mean it was so consistent with his life you know i mean i often think i 'm going to die in a plane or i 'm going to die in an airport or die jogging without an identification on me i don 't know why i sort of carry that from that memory of the way he died but he he was a sort of a nomad at heart our existences are really and how full of influence by circumstance on the morning workers who come all the time here and enjoy the walking city 's beauty and the atmosphere and this is the nicest place of bangladesh well actually i 'm here because i 'm the architect 's son never saw it finished he gave us democracy from where we can he didn 't care for how much money this country has or whether he would be able to but somehow he has been able to do it build it here and this is the largest project he has got in here the poorest country in the world nk it cost him his life sw yeah he paid his life for this and that is why he is great now his failure to satisfy the family life is an inevitable association of great people but i think his son will understand this and will have no sense of or sense of being neglected i think he cared in a very different manner but it takes a lot of time to understand that in social aspect of his life he was just like a child he was not at all matured and that is why that he cannot say no to things we got this building today you see only that way you can be able to understand him no other way to really understand him but i think he has given us this building we feel all the time for him that 's why he has given love for us he could not probably give the right kind of love for you but for us he has given the people the right kind of love that is important you he loved everybody to love he sometimes did not see the very closest ones and that is inevitable for men of his stature"
