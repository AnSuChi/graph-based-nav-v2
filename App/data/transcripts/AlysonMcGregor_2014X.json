  "transcript": "and we do so with trust and blind faith that the test they are ordering and the medications they 're prescribing are based upon evidence evidence that 's designed what if i told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population i 'm an emergency medicine doctor i was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency it 's about saving lives how cool is that ok there 's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes but no matter who walks through the door to the er we order the same tests we prescribe the same medication without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients why would we we were never taught that there were any differences between men and women a recent government accountability study revealed that eighty percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women so let 's think about that for a minute why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory to animal studies finally to go through a regulatory approval process to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes so why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through they 're male cells how is it that the male model became our framework for medical research and it has to do with the sleep aid ambien ambien was released on the market over twenty years ago and since then but just this past year the food and drug administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only causing them to wake up in and they 're at risk for motor vehicle accidents and i can 't help but think as an emergency physician how many of my patients that i 've cared for over the years were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon twenty years ago when this drug was first released how many other things need to be analyzed by gender what else are we missing and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent there was fear because let 's face it men 's bodies are pretty homogeneous they don 't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men it was cheaper not to mention at this time there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones so it was decided medical research was performed on men and the results were later applied to women what did this do to the notion of women 's health it 's this term we now refer to as bikini medicine and this stayed this way until about the 1980s when this concept was challenged by the medical community and by the public health policymakers when they realized that by excluding women from all medical research studies we actually did them a disservice virtually nothing was known about the unique needs of the female patient since that time an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light that shows us just how different men and women are in every way you know we have this saying in medicine and we say that to remind ourselves that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults and we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives and i know the same thing can be said about women women are not just men with boobs and tubes they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity let 's take the cardiovascular system for example this area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men men will complain of crushing chest pain an elephant is sitting on their chest and we call this typical women have chest pain too but more women can 't seem to get enough air in just so tired lately and so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these if we look at the anatomy the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different in women compared to men and the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack well they were initially designed tested and perfected in men and so aren 't as good at determining that in women and then if we think about the medications common medications that we use like aspirin but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman it 's actually harmful what this is doing is merely telling us that we are scratching the surface emergency medicine is a fast paced business in how many areas of medicine like cancer and stroke are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing or even why is it that some people get those runny noses more than others or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes work in some and not in others the institute of medicine has said every cell has a sex what does this mean sex is dna but it 's important to realize that from the moment of conception hair heart and lungs contains our own unique dna and that dna contains the chromosomes that determine whether we become it used to be thought that those chromosomes pictured here xy if you 're male xx if you 're female merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes but we now know that that theory was wrong and thankfully scientists like dr page from the whitehead institute who works on the y chromosome and doctor yang from ucla they have found evidence that tells us that those sex determining chromosomes that are in every cell in our bodies continue to remain active for our entire lives and could be what 's responsible for the differences we see in the dosing of drugs or why there are differences between men and women in the susceptibility and severity of diseases this new knowledge is the game changer and it 's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence but it 's up to the clinicians to start translating this data and we collect all of this data so that it 's available for teaching and we 're working to bring together the medical educators to the but i believe in them i know they 're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens into the current curriculum it 's about training the future health like heart disease and stroke but we also believe that education is we 've created a 360 degree model of education we have programs for the doctors for the nurses for the students because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders but i must warn you it 's essentially changing the way we think about medicine and health but there 's no going back we now know just but comes through continuous struggle and the first step towards change is awareness this is not just about improving medical care for women this is about personalized individualized health care for everyone this awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women and from now on i want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender they may not know the answer remember for me and my colleagues in this field your sex and gender matter thank you"
