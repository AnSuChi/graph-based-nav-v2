  "transcript": "i want to see a show of hands how many of you have unfriended someone on facebook because they said something offensive about politics or religion childcare food and how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don 't want to talk to but these days with climate change and anti vaxxing those subjects are not safe either so this world that we live in this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument where our politicians can 't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it it 's not normal and we make decisions again that means we 're not listening to each other a conversation requires a balance between talking and listening and somewhere along the way we lost that balance according to pew research about a third of american teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day and many of them almost most of them are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face and he gave his kids a communication project he wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without i came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills it might sound like a funny question but we have to ask ourselves is there any confident conversation billionaires kindergarten teachers heads of state i talk to some people that i disagree with deeply on a personal so i 'd like to spend the next ten minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen many of you have already heard a lot of advice on this things like look the person in the eye think of interesting topics to discuss in advance nod and smile to show that you 're paying attention repeat back what you just heard or summarize it so i want you to forget all of that it is crap there is no reason to learn how to show you 're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention now i actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that i do in regular life i 'm going to teach you how to interview people and that 's actually going to help you learn how to be better conversationalists learn to have a conversation without wasting your time without getting bored and please god without offending anybody we 've all had really great conversations we 've had them before we know what it 's like the kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired or where you feel like you 've made a real connection or you 've been perfectly understood there is no reason why most of your interactions can 't be like that so i have ten basic rules i 'm going to walk you through all of them but honestly if you just choose one of them and i don 't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand i be present be in that moment don 't think about your argument you had with your boss don 't think about what you 're going to have for dinner if you want to get out of the conversation get out of the conversation but don 't be half in it and half out of it number two don 't pontificate if you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or if they 're liberal they 're going to hate big banks and oil corporations and dick cheney and you don 't want to be like that you need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn m scott peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself and sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion he said that sensing this acceptance bill nye everyone you will ever meet everybody is an expert in something use open ended questions in this case take a cue from journalists start your questions with who what when where why or how if you put in a complicated question you 're going to get a simple answer out if try asking them things like what was that like how did that feel because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it and you 're going to get a much more interesting response go with the flow we 've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere or it 's already been answered that means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever and we do the exact same thing we 're sitting there having a conversation with someone and then we remember that time that we met hugh jackman in a coffee shop and we stop listening stories and ideas are going to come to you you need to let them come and let them go number five if you don 't know say that you don 't know people on the radio especially on npr are much more aware that they 're going on the record and so they 're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure if they 're talking about having lost a family member don 't start talking about it is never the same it is not about you somebody asked stephen hawking once what his iq was and he said i have no idea people who brag about their iqs are losers and we tend to do it a lot especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids we have a point to make so we just keep rephrasing it over and over people don 't care about the years the names the dates all those details that you 're struggling to come up with in your mind they don 't care what they care about is you they care about what you 're like number nine this is not the last one but it is the most important one listen buddha said and i 'm paraphrasing if your mouth is open you 're not learning and calvin coolidge said no man ever listened his way out of a job we 'd rather talk when i 'm but there 's another reason so our minds are filling in those other two it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone but if you can 't do that you 're not in a conversation you 're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place you have to listen to one another stephen covey said it very beautifully he said most of us don 't listen with the intent to understand we all of this boils down to the same basic concept and it is this one be interested in other people you know i grew up with a very famous grandfather and there was kind of a ritual in my home people would come over to talk to my grandparents she won a pulitzer prize he 's a russian ballet dancer and i kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden amazing thing about them and i 'm never disappointed go out talk to people listen to people and most importantly be prepared to be amazed"
