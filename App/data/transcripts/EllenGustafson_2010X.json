  "transcript": "and i 'm assuming that the rest of the world is too especially if you 're hungry and your kids are hungry and your neighbor 's kids are hungry and your whole neighborhood is hungry you 're pretty angry and actually lo and behold it looks pretty much like the areas of the world that are hungry are also the so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues but it also gives and she had this really awesome idea to sell the really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the feed bag it costs between twenty and fifty bucks to provide school feeding for a year you know at the u n sometimes things move slowly and they basically said no and we thought god this is such a good idea and it 's going to raise so much money so we said screw it we 'll just start our own company which we did three years ago so that was kind so feed 's we 've so far provided fifty five million meals to kids around the world by selling now five hundred and fifty thousand bags a ton of bags a lot of bags all this time you 're when you think and i really love it and the thing that 's a little strange about international hunger and talking about international issues is that most people kind of want to know what are you doing in america what are you doing for america 's kids there 's definitely hunger in america forty nine million people and almost sixteen point seven million children i mean that 's pretty dramatic for our own country but obviously the bigger problem that we all know about unfortunately obesity 's not only an american problem it so those seem like two bifurcated problems but i kind of started to think about and when you think about food the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture and agriculture is where food comes from well agriculture in america 's very interesting it 's very consolidated and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we unfortunately in our agricultural system we haven 't done a good job so african agriculture which is the place of of most hunger in the world has actually fallen precipitously as hunger has risen so somehow we 're not making the connect between exporting a good agricultural system that will help feed people all around the world and you know the reality is that between between farmers in america who actually quite frankly when i spend time in the midwest are pretty large in general and their farms are also large but farmers in the rest of the world are actually quite skinny and that 's because they 're starving most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers and most of those people are women which is a totally other topic that i won 't get on right now but i 'd love to do the feminist thing at some point mass exodus of small farmers what is farmed ends up as what we eat and in america a lot of what we eat has led to obesity and has led to a real change in sort of what our diet is in the last thirty years just in our own country but really we 're exporting the system around the world and when you look at the data of least developed countries especially in cities which are growing really rapidly people are eating american processed foods and in one generation they 're going from hunger and all of the detrimental health effects of hunger to obesity and things like diabetes and heart disease in one generation so the problematic food system is affecting both hunger i think that 's the only way to look at it and instead of taking it 's really important to look at them as one system we get a lot of our food from all around the world and people from all around the world are importing our food system so it 's incredibly relevant to start a new way of looking at it learned and the technology people that are here which i 'm totally not one of them but apparently it really takes thirty years for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us like the mouse and and and it 's the birthday of the global food system so that 's the first birthday i think if we really think that this is something that 's happened in the last thirty years there 's hope in that it 's the thirtieth anniversary of gmo crops and the big gulp chicken mcnuggets high fructose corn the farm crisis in america and the change in how we 've addressed agriculture internationally so there 's a lot of reasons to take this 30 year time period as as sort of the creation of this new food system i three decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change well i really care about one thousand nine hundred and eighty because it 's also the thirtieth anniversary of me this year and so so my second dream is that i think we can so if we start now and we look at technologies and improvements to the food system long term we might actually look for long term solutions we all tend to think that these systems are quite different and people argue whether or not organic can feed the world but if we take a 30 year view there 's more hope in collaborative so i 'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations like the one campaign and slow food which don 't seem right now to have much in common we can talk about understanding how to produce protein in a way that 's healthy for the environment and healthy for people will be incredibly important to address things like climate change and how we use petrochemical fertilizers and you and i also think that thinking about processed foods in a new way where we actually price the negative externalities like petrochemicals and like fertilizer runoff into the price of a bag of chips well if that bag of chips then becomes inherently more expensive than an apple then maybe it 's time for a different sense of personal responsibility in food choice because the choices are actually choices instead of three quarters of the products being made just from corn soy and wheat the and i 've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start and it 'll be growing over but i really hope that you will all think of ways that you can look long term at at things like the food system and make change"
