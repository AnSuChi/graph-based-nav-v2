  "transcript": "could i protect my father from the armed islamic group with a paring knife that was the question i faced one tuesday morning in june of one thousand nine hundred and ninety three when i was a law student i woke up early that morning in dad 's apartment on the outskirts of algiers algeria to an unrelenting pounding on the front door it was a season as described by a local paper when every tuesday a scholar fell to the bullets of fundamentalist assassins my father 's university teaching of darwin had already provoked a classroom visit from the head of the so called islamic salvation front who denounced dad as an and that was when i went to the kitchen got out a paring knife and took up a position inside the entryway it was a ridiculous thing to do really but i 't think of anything else and so there i stood untold stories from the fight against muslim fundamentalism i think it was actually that moment that sent me on the journey to interview three hundred people of muslim heritage from nearly thirty countries from afghanistan to mali but other families were so and that was the thought that motivated my research in any case someone would return a few months later and leave a note on dad 's kitchen table which simply said consider yourself dead algeria 's fundamentalist armed groups would murder as many as two hundred thousand civilians in what came to be known as the dark decade of the including every single one of the women that you see here and as terrible as all of these events became the international community largely ignored them finally my father an algerian peasant 's son turned professor was forced to stop teaching at the university and to flee his apartment but what i will never forget about that like so many other algerian intellectuals he refused to leave the country and he continued to publish pointed criticisms both of the fundamentalists and sometimes of the government they battled for example in a november one thousand nine hundred and ninety four series in the newspaper el watan entitled how fundamentalism produced a he denounced what he called the terrorists ' radical break with the true islam as it was lived by our ancestors these were words that could get you killed my father 's country taught me in that dark decade of the 1990s that the popular struggle against muslim fundamentalism is one of the most important and overlooked human rights struggles in the world this remains true today nearly twenty years later you see in every country where you hear about armed jihadis targeting civilians there are also unarmed people defying those militants that you don 't hear about and those people need our support to succeed and some on the left imagine this because and often for very good reason let me just give between two thousand and four and two thousand and eight no more than fifteen percent of al qaeda 's victims were westerners that 's a terrible toll but the vast majority were people of muslim heritage killed by muslim fundamentalists now i 've been talking for the last five minutes and she says that note the s so within all of the world 's great religious traditions are political movements of the extreme right which in a context of globalization manipulate religion in order to achieve their political aims sadia abbas has called this the radical politicization of theology some do not though they 're often interrelated they 're most often about changing people 's relationship with islam rather than preserving it what i am talking about is the muslim so in my view if we consider ourselves liberal or left wing human rights loving or feminist we must oppose these movements and support their grassroots opponents now let me be clear that i support an effective struggle against fundamentalism but also a struggle that must itself respect international law and here i send out a shout out of support to the pro democracy movement in algeria today barakat nor should anything i say be taken as a justification of violations of human rights like the mass death sentences handed out in egypt and they do this in a range of ways most obviously with the direct attacks on civilians by the armed groups that carry those out but that violence is just the tip of the iceberg these movements as a whole purvey discrimination against religious definingly they lead an all out war on the rights of women now faced with these movements in recent years western discourse has most often offered the first that one sometimes finds on the right suggests that most muslims are fundamentalist or something about islam is inherently fundamentalist but unfortunately on the left one sometimes encounters a discourse that is too politically correct to acknowledge the problem of muslim fundamentalism at all and this is unacceptable as well so what i 'm seeking is a new way of about this all together which is grounded in the lived experiences and the hope of the people on the front lines i 'm painfully aware that there has been an increase in discrimination against muslims in recent years in countries like the but i firmly believe that telling these of people of muslim heritage who have confronted the fundamentalists and been their primary victims is also a great way of countering that discrimination so now let me introduce you to four people whose stories i had the great honor of telling and the rafi peer theatre workshop named for his father have for years promoted the performing arts in pakistan with the rise of jihadist violence they began to receive threats to and so a bomber struck their two thousand and eight eighth world performing arts festival in lahore producing rain of glass that fell into the venue injuring nine people they announced that their festival would continue as planned the next day but they didn 't know what would happen would anyone come and this simultaneously thrilled and terrified faizan and he ran up to a woman and you do know there 's a threat here today and i still have those images in my mind we have to be here and then the next year they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk and this was the ninth youth performing arts festival held in lahore in a year when that city had already experienced forty four terror attacks this was a time when the pakistani taliban had commenced their systematic targeting of girls ' schools that would culminate in the attack they staged girls ' school theater they sang and and i held my breath wondering and i remember thinking in that moment that the bombers made headlines here two years before but this night and these people maria bashir is the first and only woman chief prosecutor in afghanistan she 's been in the post since two thousand and eight and actually opened an office to investigate cases of violence against women which she says is the most important area in her mandate when i meet her in her office in why does she continue she says with a smile that that is the question that everyone asks as she puts it why you risk not living and it is there will be no better future later on in our interview prosecutor bashir tells me how worried she is about the possible outcome of government negotiations with the taliban the people who have been trying to kill her if we give them a place in the government asks who will protect women 's rights and she urges the international community not to forget its promise about women because now they want peace with taliban and when i hear headlines like that now i think that as international troops leave afghanistan this year and beyond we must continue to care about what happens to people there to all of the maria bashirs sometimes i still hear her voice in my head saying with no bravado whatsoever we should prepare the ground for this even if we are killed sixty seven including poets and pregnant women far away in the american midwest i had the good fortune of meeting were working to counter the efforts of al shabaab to recruit a small number of young people from their city of minneapolis to take part in atrocities like westgate abdirizak bihi 's and then killed when he tried to come home since that time mr bihi who directs the no budget somali education and advocacy center has been vocally denouncing the recruitment and the failures of government and somali american institutions like the abubakar islamic center where he believes his nephew was radicalized during a youth program he also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent poverty in his community given his own lack of financial resources mr bihi has had to be creative to counter the efforts of al shabaab to sway more disaffected youth in the wake of the group 's two thousand and ten attack on world cup viewers in uganda he organized a ramadan they played basketball as burhan hassan never would again for his efforts mr bihi has been ostracized by the leadership of the abubakar islamic center with which he used to have good relations he told me one day we saw the imam on tv calling us infidels and saying ' these families are trying to destroy the mosque ' abdirizak bihi understands what he is trying to do by exposing al shabaab recruitment which is to save the religion i love from a small number of extremists now i want to tell one last story that of a 22 year old law student in algeria named amel who had the same dreams of a legal career that i did back in the ' 90s she refused to give up her studies despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education on january amel boarded the bus in algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a ramadan evening with her family and would never finish law school when the bus reached the outskirts of her hometown it was stopped at a checkpoint manned by men from the armed islamic group the men who cut her throat then told everyone else if you go to university the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this amel died at exactly five seventeen p m which we know because when she fell in the street her watch broke her mother showed me the watch with the second hand still aimed optimistically upward towards a five eighteen that would but if something happens you must know that we are dead for knowledge you and father must keep your heads held high and so as i did my research i found myself searching for amel 's hope again and her name even means i think i found it in two places the first is in the strength of her family and all the other families to continue telling their stories and to go on with their lives despite the terrorism something which is only possible because the armed fundamentalists were largely defeated in the country and the second place i found amel 's hope was everywhere that women and men continue to defy the jihadis it is not enough as why is it that everyone knows who osama bin laden was and so few know of all of those standing up to the bin ladens in their own contexts we must change that and so i ask you to please help share these stories through your networks we don 't have the right to be silent about them because it is easier or because western policy is flawed as well because five seventeen is still coming to too many zenounes in places like northern nigeria where jihadis still kill students thank you"
