  "transcript": "is a different kind of death it 's bigger died at the cincinnati zoo this had been the most abundant bird in the world suddenly it wasn 't here at all flocks that were a mile wide and four hundred miles long used to darken the sun aldo leopold said this was a biological storm and indeed it was a keystone species that enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest from the mississippi to the atlantic from canada well commercial hunting happened these birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands it was the cheapest source of protein in america and so these birds saved the buffalos a lot of other animals weren 't saved the carolina parakeet there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again there 's a sense of deep tragedy that another keystone species is a famous animal called the european aurochs there was sort of a movie made about it recently this was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire europe and asian continent from spain to korea there 's an ibex in spain called the bucardo it went extinct in two thousand there was a marvelous animal a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in tasmania south of it was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos a little bit of film was shot sorrow out that using the dna in museum specimens fossils maybe up to two hundred thousand years old could be used to bring species back what would you do where would you start well you 'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there and through her one of her colleagues and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named beth shapiro all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue because down in there is what is called ancient dna it 's dna which is pretty badly fragmented but with good techniques now you can basically reassemble the whole genome then the question is can you reassemble with that genome the whole bird george church thinks you can so in his book regenesis which i recommend he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species and he has a machine called the multiplex automated genome engineering machine it 's kind of like an evolution machine you try combinations of genes that you write nevertheless points out that there 's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair the passenger pigeon has one point three billion base pairs in its genome so what you 're getting is the capability now of replacing one gene with another variation of that gene so this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome of an extinct species with the genome of its closest living relative now along the way george points out that his technology the technology of synthetic biology is currently accelerating at four times the rate of moore 's law it 's been doing that since two they 're abundant there 's some around here band tailed pigeon cooing at you band tailed pigeon genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon and so on with the red eye peach colored breast flocking and so on add them so this meeting in boston led to three things first off ryan and i decided to create a nonprofit called revive and restore that would push de extinction generally using money from his family and friends we hired him full time now this photograph i took of him last year at the smithsonian he 's looking down at martha the last passenger pigeon alive so if he 's successful she won 't be the last the third result of the boston meeting was the realization that there are scientists all over the world working on various forms of but they 'd never met each other and and in this century discovery is basically making things de extinction falls in that category so they hosted and funded this meeting and thirty five scientists they were conservation biologists and molecular biologists basically meeting to see if they had work to do some of these conservation biologists are pretty radical there 's three of them who are not just re creating ancient species they 're recreating extinct ecosystems the aurochs is the ancestor of all so what they 're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive hardy looking cattle like that maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild over time with selective back breeding the aurochs and so the plan is areas all over europe they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job its old ecological role of clearing the somewhat barren closed canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it another amazing story came from alberto but then they cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen they planted it as a cloned egg in a goat the pregnancy came to term sometimes interspecies clones have but alberto was confident that cloning has moved along well since then and this will move ahead and eventually there will be a population of bucardos back in the mountains in northern spain pioneer of great depth is oliver ryder minus one hundred and ninety six degrees celsius the cells are intact and the dna is intact they 're basically so someone like bob lanza and the most exciting thing for bob lanza is the ability now to take any kind of cell with induced pluripotent stem cells so he 'll take say falcon skin cells fibroblast turn it into induced pluripotent stem cells since it 's so pluripotent it can become germ plasm he then has a way to put the germ plasm into the embryo you get a male and a female each of those and out of them comes falcons real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens ben novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting he showed how all of this can be put together band tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon he 'll take the squabs passenger pigeon parents to teach them how to be a passenger pigeon so what do you do about that but to supplement it part of ben 's idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds they 're excited about all this but they 're also concerned that it might be competitive with the extremely important efforts to protect endangered species that are still alive that haven 't gone extinct yet you want to work on getting the market for ivory in asia down so you 're not using twenty five thousand elephants a year but at the same time conservation biologists are realizing that bad news bums people out and so the red list is really important keep track of what 's endangered and critically endangered and so they 're about to create what they call a green list and the green list will have species that are doing fine thank you and they see reviving extinct species as the kind of good news you might be able to build on examples captive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species the california condor was down to two hundred and twenty six are out in the wild that technology will be used on de extincted animals another success story is the mountain gorilla in central africa the secret is they have so this photograph was taken last month by ryan with an iphone that 's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors another interesting project though it 's going to need some help is the northern white rhinoceros there 's no breeding pairs left but this is the kind of thing that a wide variety of dna for this animal is available in the frozen zoo a bit of cloning you can get them back you want extinct species back do you want extinct species back tinker bell is going to come fluttering down it is a tinker bell moment because what are people excited about with this what are they concerned about we 're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon even as we speak band tailed pigeon as that data matures they 'll send it to george church who will work his magic get passenger pigeon dna out of that we 'll get help from bob lanza and mike mcgrew to get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens that can produce passenger pigeon squabs that can be raised by from then on it 's passenger pigeons all the way maybe for the next six million years you can do the same thing as the costs come down for the carolina parakeet for the great auk for the heath hen for the ivory billed woodpecker for the eskimo curlew for the caribbean monk seal for the woolly mammoth because the fact is humans have a huge hole in nature in the last ten thousand years but some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them emotional topic some people stand i suspect there are some people out there sitting kind of asking tormented questions almost about well wait wait wait wait wait wait a minute there 's going to be unintended consequences you 're going to uncork some sort of pandora 's box of do they have a point stewart brand well and many of them were keystone species and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go there 's the shifting baseline problem which is so when these things come back they might replace some birds that are there slow process one of the things i like about it we will get woolly mammoths back ca well it feels like both the conversation and the potential here are pretty thrilling thank you so much for"
