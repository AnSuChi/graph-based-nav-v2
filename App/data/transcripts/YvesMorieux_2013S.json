  "transcript": "have spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies where i work i have worked with more than the internet enigma number two disengaging their colleagues acting against the interest of their at the beginning i thought there was a chicken and egg issue because people are less engaged they are less productive or vice versa because they are less but as we were doing our analysis we realized that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates in fact to the basic pillars of management sentiments interpersonal relationships personality it chooses these two pillars everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their the hard approach basically is that you start from strategy you name it i forgot all the what happens basically on the left you have more complexity the new complexity of business cost reliability speed and every time there is a new requirement we use the same approach we create dedicated structure the hard approach in the organization some years ago a new requirement appeared on the length of the warranty period so therefore the new requirement is repairability making cars easy to repair otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light if you have to remove the engine and the warranty budget will what percentage of these people is variable compensation twenty percent at most divided by makes a difference of zero point eight percent mr repairability process scorecard evaluation coordination with the twenty five other coordinators to have the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines it is the nervous system of they use less resources in everything you know the repairability issue is a cooperation problem when you design cars please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages when we don 't cooperate we need more time more equipment more teams we need when procurement supply chain manufacturing don 't cooperate we need more stock more inventories more working capital who will pay for that who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation how do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation the hard in banks when there is a problem between the back office and the front office they don 't cooperate what is the solution they create the hard approach is unable to foster cooperation it can only add new boxes new bones in the skeleton the soft approach to make people cooperate we need to make them why precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife if i didn 't love my wife one tv would be enough how is the book or the door the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs and we go for a second tv or we escalate the decision above for have to remove the engine to access the lights the new complexity of business"
