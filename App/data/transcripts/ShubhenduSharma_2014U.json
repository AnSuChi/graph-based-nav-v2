  "transcript": "while working at toyota all i knew was how to make cars came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral i was so fascinated and this is how it looks after three years grow ten times faster within two years of having this forest in our backyard quality of air became better and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house i wanted to make more of these forests i was so moved by these results that i wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business but to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry we had to standardize the process of forest making so we benchmarked the toyota production system known for its quality and efficiency the core of tps toyota production system lies in heijunka which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly multi layered forests for an example we can make a forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars in order to reduce cost and our own carbon we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure once planted we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn 't get evaporated back into the atmosphere even in factories with the corporates but that 's not enough there is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands so we let it happen today we are working on an internet based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there they can get to know all the native species of their place by installing we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site this methodology i believe has a potential by sharing we can actually bring back our native forests if you see a barren piece of land do remember that it can be a potential forest thank you very much"
