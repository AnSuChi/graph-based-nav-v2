  "transcript": "how do we build a society without fossil fuels and i 'm aware that this is a contentious statement but the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries if we let fossil fuels stay at the center of our development we can do it differently and it 's time it really is time to debunk the myth that a country has to choose between development on the one hand quality of life on the other and we live right in the middle of the americas so it 's very easy to remember where we live it 's a fantastic which is that nearly seventy so if we think of the energy transition as a marathon the question is how do we get to the finish line because i believe we are a great candidate in pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels if you know one thing about our country it 's that we don 't have an army so i 'm going to take you back to we would reboot the country so we abolished it and the president at the time and that is why i can tell you that story nearly seventy years later and you might be thinking that it was good luck we were able to turn military spending and that was a driver of stability in the ' 50s and that kept us away from the trap of using fossil fuels for electricity generation which is what the world is struggling with today and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic of growth growth growth at any cost that you see others embracing especially in the developing world in the and it doesn 't mean we don 't have contradictions that 's not the point the point is that by making our own choices but according to the social progress index we are an absolute outlier when it comes to turning gdp into social progress abolishing the investing in nature and people did something and i believe what comes next is for this generation to let go of fossil fuels for good so as a developing country it is in our best interest to build development without fossil fuels that harm because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead remember this is the country where abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy and transportation let me tell you become an existential issue for us costa ricans because the model we have is not working for us it 's hurting people it this is what happens on a daily basis two hours in the morning two hours in the evening it 's offensive and this highway is actually quite good compared to what you see in other countries where traffic is exploding you know costa ricans call this are turning violent the good news is that when we talk about clean transportation and different mobility we 're not talking about some we 're talking about electric mobility that is happening today by electric cars and conventional cars are expected to cost the same and cities are already trying electric buses and these really cool creatures so if we want to get rid of but of course some get very uncomfortable with this idea and they will come and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil and you know what the answer to that argument is that in one thousand nine hundred and forty eight we didn 't say the world is stuck with armies so let 's keep our army too no and that choice made the whole difference so it 's time for this generation to be brave again and i 'll give you three reasons why we have to do this first our model of transportation and urbanization is broken so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future we don 't want cities that are built for cars we want cities for people and we want public because if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars our cities will become unbearable but incremental change is not going to be sufficient and there are some incremental projects in my country and i am the first one to celebrate them but let 's not kid ourselves we 're not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there and you know this one the world is hungry for inspiration it craves stories of success in dealing with complex issues especially so i believe costa rica can be an inspiration to others as we did last year when we disclosed that for so many days we were not using any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity the news went viral also and this makes me extremely proud a costa rican woman played a decisive role so what comes next the people how do we get people to own this how do we get people to believe that it 's possible to build a society without fossil fuels a lot of work from the ground up is needed that is why in two thousand and fourteen we created costa rica because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens if citizens don 't get technical discussions and by avalanches of lobbying by various established interests wanting to be a green country we should not let anybody take that away from us last year and we also brought this year another group of costa ricans to talk about renewable energy and you know what these people disagree on almost everything except it brings people together and we translate technical issues into citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together for the first time we 're tracking the promises but the tipping point will come when we form coalitions by the time the next election comes i believe every candidate it 's about the country that we want and the cities that we have because at the end of the day what we have to show is that development with renewable energy is good for the people for costa ricans that are alive today and especially for those who haven 't been born this is our national museum today it 's bright and peaceful and when you stand up in front of it it 's really hard and here is where and we will make history again thank you"
