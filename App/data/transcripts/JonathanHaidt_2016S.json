  "transcript": "it feels like the world is in a place that we haven 't seen for a long time people don 't just disagree in the way that we 're familiar with on the jh this is different survey research by pew research shows that those numbers have been going up and up and those are over fifty percent now whenever i look at so the first the first thing that you have to always keep in mind when you 're thinking about politics is that we 're tribal we evolved for tribalism one of the simplest and greatest insights into human social nature is the bedouin proverb me against my brother me and my brother against our cousin me and my brother and cousins against the stranger and that that tribalism allowed us to create large societies and to come together in order to compete with others that brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups but it means that we have eternal conflict the question you have to look at is what aspects of our society are making that more bitter and what are calming them down ca that 's a very dark proverb you 're saying that that 's actually baked into most people 's mental wiring at some level jh oh absolutely this is just a basic aspect of human social cognition but sports politics these are all ways that we get to exercise this this tribal nature without actually hurting anyone we but we 'll never have world peace ca the size of that tribe can shrink or expand as we 've all inherited it comes out of the labor versus capital distinction and the working class but i think what we 're seeing now increasingly is a divide in all the western democracies between and then those who and who whenever i get confused i just think of the john lennon song imagine imagine there 's no countries nothing to kill or die for and so these are the people who you see this all over europe as well there 's a great metaphor guy actually his name is shakespeare writing ten years ago in britain those of us who grew up with the beatles and that sort of hippie philosophy of of dreaming of a more connected world it felt so idealistic and how could anyone think badly about that and what you 're saying is that actually millions of people today feel that that isn 't just silly it 's actually dangerous and wrong and they 're scared of it jh i think the big issue especially in europe but also here is the issue of immigration and i think this is where that the left loves and the right it clearly creates more innovation the american economy has grown enormously immigration do a lot of good things but what the globalists i think don 't see what they don 't want to see is that ethnic diversity there 's a very important study by robert by robert putnam the author of bowling alone the more they can have a redistributionist welfare state scandinavian countries are so wonderful because they have this legacy of being which says drawbridge down the world is a great place people in syria are suffering we must welcome them in and it 's a beautiful thing but if and i was in sweden this summer if the discourse in sweden is fairly politically correct and they can 't talk about the downsides you end up bringing a lot of people in that 's going to cut social capital it makes it hard to have a welfare state and they so this is all very uncomfortable to talk about but i think this is the thing especially in europe and for us too we need to be looking at ca you 're saying that people of reason people who would consider themselves not racists but moral upstanding people have a rationale that says humans are just too different that we 're in danger of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of by mixing in people who are too different jh yes but i can make it much more palatable palatable by saying it 's not necessarily about race it 's about culture there 's wonderful work by a political scientist named karen stenner who shows that when people have a sense but if you prime them experimentally by thinking we 're coming apart people are getting more different then they get more racist homophobic they want to kick out the deviants so it 's in part that you get an authoritarian reaction left following through the lennonist line the john lennon line does things that create an authoritarian reaction we 're certainly seeing that in america with the alt right we saw it in britain we 've seen it all over europe but the more positive part of that is that i think the localists or the nationalists are actually right that if you emphasize our then race doesn 't actually matter very much so an assimilationist approach to immigration removes a lot of these problems and if you value having a generous welfare state you 've got to emphasize that we 're all the same ca so rising immigration and fears about that are one of the causes of the current what are other causes jh the next principle of moral psychology is that intuitions but to help us manipulate each other defend our reputation whereas if you 're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong can 't accept that so this is why you can 't win a political argument if you because that 's not the way reasoning works so now give us the internet give us google i heard that barack obama was born in kenya let me google that oh my god ten million hits look this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people social media has often been framed by techno optimists as this great connecting force that would that would bring people together and there have been some unexpected counter effects to that jh but then it the right social conservatives not libertarians social conservatives generally believe people can be greedy and sexual and selfish and we need regulation and we need restrictions allow people to communicate all over the world you get a lot of porn and a lot of i 'll just list a couple of them so in america one of the big actually and europe one of the biggest ones is world war ii there 's interesting research from joe henrich and others that says if your country was at war especially when you were young then we test you thirty years later in a commons dilemma or a prisoner 's dilemma you 're more cooperative because of our tribal nature if you 're my parents were teenagers during world war ii and and so then these people go on they all retire by the ' 90s so we 're left with baby boomers by the end of the ' 90s and their youth was spent fighting each other within each country so america had a mid 20th century that was really bipartisan but because of a variety of factors that started things moving by the ninety 's we had a purified liberal party and conservative party so now the people in either party really are different and we really don 't want our children to marry them third is the internet and as i said it 's just the most amazing stimulant for post hoc reasoning and demonization ca the tone of what 's i just did a quick search on twitter about the election and saw two tweets next to each other is troubling to me because you can have an argument or a disagreement about something you can get angry at someone disgust i 've heard you say takes things to a much deeper level i have kids they fight ten times a day and they love each other thirty times a day you just go back and marital therapy if you look at the faces if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt that 's a predictor that they 're going to get divorced soon whereas if they show anger that doesn 't predict anything because if you deal with anger well it actually is good so this election is different 's something unique to him but as as we demonize each other more and again through the manichaean worldview the idea that the world is a battle between good and evil as this has been ramping up we 're more likely not just to say they 're wrong or i don 't like them but we say and that 's why i think we seeing it for example on campus now we 're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus silence them keep them away i 'm afraid that this whole generation of young people if their introduction to they 're not going to want to be involved in politics as they i think and i think that the opposite of disgust is actually love love love is about so personal relationships i think are probably the most powerful means we have you can be disgusted by a group of people but then you meet a particular person and you genuinely discover that they 're lovely and then gradually that chips away or changes your your category as well the tragedy is americans used to be much more or politics and now that it 's become this great moral divide there 's a lot of evidence that we 're moving to be near people who are like us politically it 's harder to find somebody who 's on the other side so they 're over there they 're far away it 's harder to get to know them ca what would you say to really important thing to keep in mind there 's research by political scientist alan abramowitz showing that american democracy is increasingly governed by what 's called negative partisanship you like the candidate you vote for the candidate but with the rise of negative advertising and social media and so as we more and more vote against the other side and not for our side you have to keep in mind that if people are on the left this is the most negative partisanship election in american history so you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate from your feelings about the people who are given a choice and then you have to realize that because we all live in a separate moral world the metaphor i use in the book is that we 're all trapped in the matrix everything 's completely compelling that the other side they 're troglodytes they 're racists they 're the worst people in the world and you have all the facts to back that up they live in a different video game there are a lot of threats to this country and each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all i feel your pain i can put myself in your shoes and we apply it to the poor the needy the suffering we don 't usually apply it to people who we feel as other or we 're disgusted by what would it look like to build that type of of empathy jh actually i think and empathy for the preferred classes of victims so it 's important to empathize with the groups that we on the left think are so important that 's easy to do because you get points for that i 'm hoping it will make people see that we have an existential threat on our hands but this is the urgent need of the next fifty years and things aren 't going to get better on their own wonky conversation and we need a new kind of empathy we need to realize and this is what you need if you don 't want to raise your hand if you want to spend the next four years as angry and worried as you 've been for the last year raise your hand read buddha read jesus read marcus aurelius they have all kinds of great advice for how to drop the fear reframe things stop seeing other people as your enemy there 's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom for this kind of empathy ca here 's my last question personally what can people do to help heal jh yeah it 's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices and there 's research showing that political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices in the country now so i think you have to make an effort that that 's the main thing make an effort to actually meet somebody everybody has a cousin a brother in law somebody who 's on the other side so after this wait a week or two because it 's probably going to feel awful for one of you but wait a couple weeks and then reach out and and say you want to talk and before you do it read dale carnegie how to win friends and influence people i 'm totally serious you 'll learn techniques if you start by acknowledging if you start by saying you know we don 't agree on a lot but one thing i really respect about you uncle bob or about you conservatives you can find something if you start with some appreciation it 's like magic but i 'm incredibly good at apologizing now and at acknowledging what somebody was right about and if you do that then the conversation goes really well and it 's actually really fun ca jon ground that we 're on is a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature your wisdom couldn 't be more relevant thank you so much for sharing this time with"
