  "transcript": "boarded a flight from minneapolis to the horn of africa and while burhan was the youngest recruit he was not alone they 've changed our everyday lives but they 've also changed recruitment radicalization and the front lines of conflict today what about the links connecting twitter google and protesters fighting for democracy these numbers represent google 's public dns servers effectively the only digital border crossing protesters had and could use to communicate with each other to reach the outside world and to spread viral awareness of what was happening if there are bounds to conflict they 're bound by digital not physical geography and under all this is a vacuum of power where non state actors individuals and private organizations have the advantage and this is because in the digital age of conflict there exists a feedback loop where new technologies platforms like the ones i mentioned and more disruptive ones can be adapted learned and deployed deployed by individuals and organizations faster than governments can react to understand the pace of our own government thinking on this i like to turn to something aptly named the worldwide threat assessment where every year and he says these are the threats these are the details and this is how we rank them it took until two thousand and eleven when it came at the end where other things like west african drug trafficking took precedence in two thousand and twelve it crept up still behind things like terrorism and proliferation in two thousand and thirteen it became the top threat what things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn often wholly untraceable and conflict isn 't just online to offline as we see with terrorist radicalization but it goes the other way as well know the horrible events that unfolded in paris this year with the charlie hebdo terrorist attacks what an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in on google all sorts of places where millions and this turned into a weapon downloaded it and so when you downloaded this image it hacked your system it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign and it goes the other way as well with recruitment we see online radicalization of teens who can then be deployed globally for offline terrorist attacks with all of this we see that there 's a new 21st century battle brewing and governments don 't necessarily take a part so in another case anonymous hung two bloggers with a sign that said this is what will happen to all internet busybodies later they beheaded a young girl they severed her head put it on top of her computer with a similar note and taking the digital counteroffensive because governments couldn 't even understand what was going on or act anonymous a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world took action not in cyber attacks but threatening information to be free on social media they said we will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel los zetas said we will kill ten people for every bit of information you release but what was powerful about this was that anonymous individuals not federal policia not military not politicians could strike fear deep into the heart of one of the most powerful violent organizations in the world and so we live in an era that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict in the tools and techniques used and how quickly they evolve and the question still remains what can individuals organizations and governments do for answers to these questions it starts with individuals and i think peer to peer security is the answer those people in relationships that bought over and we can create those positive peer to peer relationships on and offline we can support and educate the next generation of hackers like myself instead of saying you can either be a criminal or join the nsa that matters and it 's not just individuals it 's organizations corporations even they have an advantage to act across more borders more effectively and more rapidly than governments can and there 's a set of real incentives there it and will only be more so but we still can 't ignore government because that 's who we turn to for collective action to keep us safe but we see where that 's gotten us so far where there 's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict secretary of defense they say cyber pearl harbor by banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking sure gchq and the nsa can spy on you but that doesn 't mean that they 're the only ones that can capabilities are cheap even free technical ability is rising around the world and individuals and small groups have the advantage and so i would say that it 's not what governments can do it 's that they can 't governments today need to give up power and control in order to help make us more secure they can 't spy on us but neither can the chinese or that hacker in estonia a generation from now but it means that developers translators anybody with an internet connection in countries like cuba iran and china can sell their and so it should be it should be inspiring to the same governments that fought for civil rights free speech and democracy in the great wars of the last century that today for the first time in human it should be inspiring"
