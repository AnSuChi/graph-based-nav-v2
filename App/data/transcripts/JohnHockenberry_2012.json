  "transcript": "my dad was which is kind of an interesting way to grow up i had to figure out what it is my dad dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up you know bad design is is just people not thinking john he would say you know bad design there 's just no excuse for it it 's letting stuff happen it should imagine a user it should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object good design my dad said is about supplying intent and design was in everything my dad did and i would ask him every once in a while dad do you want it to sound like the record we had lots of old jazz records lying around the house and he said it 's where we all belong all of us given it 's kind of like this wheelchair i 'm in right anybody i don 't like to talk about this very much but i 'll tell you guys the story today this week that 's right i was in a poorly designed automobile that hit a poorly designed guardrail and plummeted down a 200 foot embankment and killed two people my life at the mercy of good design i roll swiftly through an airport right and moms grab their kids out of the way has this terrified look on his face god knows what they think and for for decades i 'm going why does this happen what can i do about it how can i change this i mean there must be something so or i 'd i wouldn 't shower for a week nothing worked nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago my six year old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that i had and they said oh dad dad look you gotta get these these flashy wheels you gotta get all and of course they immediately concluded oh how important could you be then they said all right right i 'll get the wheels purely out of protest i got the flashy wheels and i mean totally changed my life instead of blank stares and awkwardness now it is pointing and smiling people going i mean i want some of those wheels little kids say can i have a ride i guess they 're for safety right what 's the difference here the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights the difference i chose to change the situation i 'm the commander of the starship wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the acting with intent it conveys authorship it suggests that someone is driving it covering the tragic tune with something different something radically different now it seems simple but actually i think in our society and culture in general we have a huge problem with intent now go with me here look you know who this is it 's anders breivik now if he dozens and dozens of young people we punish him life in prison death penalty in the united states not so much in norway if he was motivated by some random he 's in a completely different category we may put him away for life but we watch him clinically anders breivik is he 's something much more complicated he 's the breath he 's the random state of nature we emerged from he 's something very intent is a marker for civilization you can probably tell there are two sets of twins the result of ivf technology in vitro fertilization technology due to some physical limitations i won 't go into anyway in vitro let me tell you some of you may have the experience he 's a great guy this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he 'd worked with all the different animals probes he designed and in fact he was really really proud of these probes he would say you 're right between horse and squirrel john wife and i decided to upgrade our early middle age we had four kids after all with a little different technology that i won 't explain in too much detail here my urologist assured me i had nothing whatsoever to worry about no need for birth control doc are you sure about that of birth control well laughter what a liberating thought yes and after a couple very liberating weekends my wife and i utilizing some cutting edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a tedtalk someday but i won 't get into it now we i wasn 't exactly a form of birth control look at that font there my wife was so pissed i mean did a designer come up with that no i don 't think a designer did come up with that in fact maybe that 's the problem and so little ajax was he 's like our other children but the experience is completely different we 're five now five facing the given with intent the name ajax you can 't get much more intentional than that right we 're really hoping he thanks us for that later on but i never became a designer no no no no never attempted never even close i did love some great designs as i was growing up the hp 35s calculator god i loved that thing oh god i wish i had one other designs i really couldn 't afford like the one thousand nine hundred and seventy four nine hundred and eleven targa but there were some lessons even there plato it turns out he 's a designer he designed a state in the republic a design never implemented listen to one of the design features of plato 's government four point the worst well got that wrong didn 't we it 's a grand idea of design a huge idea they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive as the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos a confrontation with random brutal nature by various designs by various gods gods we 're still fighting about today it is the chaos of humanity 's impact on the earth itself that we confront this young discipline called design i think is in fact the emerging ethos formulating and then answering a very new question what shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created what shall we do how shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create on all the circumstances we create that won 't do that won 't do at all here 's my favorite design moment the a horrible horrible place and i needed to go and and explore the center of kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting people were carrying off vehicles carrying off pieces of buildings soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests and i was completely invisible i was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like a looter i was in a wheelchair i didn 't look like and i didn 't look like a soldier that 's for sure i was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of zaire completely invisible from around a corner comes this young man paralyzed just like me in this metal and wood he didn 't know any other english than that but we didn 't need english no no no no no and i looked at his whacky pedal mechanism he was full of pride over his design i wish i could show you that contraption his smile our glow as we talked a universal language invisible to the chaos around us he was particularly proud of the comfortable seat really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its he would have understood those a chariot of pure intent think about it we spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos and i pose this question an object imbued with intent an object devoid of intent it 's random it repels us it 's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away this is what we must demand living and i have to say that on that score i have a very unfair advantage over all of you want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day thirty six years ago a 19 year old boy awoke from a coma but the nurse was already there with an answer you 've had a terrible accident young man you 've broken your i know all that what day is it and i knew i knew i had no option but to make up this new life without walking intent covering the original with something better it 's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times to get back to this to get back to design show everybody what you intend to get back to a lot"
