  "transcript": "you 've heard that there 's a pack of giant asteroids headed for the united states all scheduled to strike within the next fifty years we would put aside our differences but they 're wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us and therefore paralyzes us 1980s and it seems that the predictions he made back then are coming true and if we keep on going the way we 're going we get this is what a five meter rise in sea levels would look like low lying cities all around the world hansen closed his talk the more difficult and expensive it becomes but the right denies that there 's any problem all right so i go back from ted and then the following week i 'm invited to a dinner party in washington d c where i know that i 'll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals including yuval levin and to prepare for the meeting i read this article by levin in national affairs called beyond the welfare state levin writes that all over the world nations are coming to terms with the fact that the social democratic welfare state is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable dependent upon dubious economics and the demographic model of a bygone era all right now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid but look at these graphs that levin showed this graph shows the national debt and as you see if you go all the way back to the founding we borrowed a lot of money to fight the revolutionary war wars are expensive but then we 'd pay it off pay it off pay it off and then oh what 's this the civil war even more expensive borrow a lot of money pay it off pay it off pay it off get down to near zero and bang world war i once again the same process repeats now then we get the great depression and world war ii we rise to an astronomical level around one hundred and eighteen percent of gdp and when they do this is what will happen this is data from the congressional budget office showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen if current situations and expectations and trends are extended all right now what you might notice is that these two graphs are actually identical they say the same thing let me translate for you we are doomed unless we start acting now what 's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party can 't you see reality if you won 't help then get the hell out of the way we can deflect both of these asteroids these problems are both technically solvable our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper partisan times the mere fact that one side says look there 's an asteroid means that the other side 's going to say huh what no i 'm not even going to look up no so i 'm a social psychologist and i study morality and one of the most important principles of morality is that morality binds and blinds it binds us into teams that circle around sacred values think of it like this large scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet there are only a few species that can do it that 's a beehive that 's a termite and when you find this in other animals it 's always the same story they 're always all siblings as one this is a reconstruction hunter gatherers ten thousand years ago and part of the explanation is this ability to circle around sacred values as you see temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations it 's a sacred rock and when people circle something together they unite they can trust each other they become it 's as though you 're moving an electrical wire through a magnetic field that generates current when people circle together they generate a current we love to circle around things we circle around we begin separating everything into good versus evil this is a graph that shows the degree to which voting in congress falls strictly along the but then after world war i things dropped and we get this historically low level of polarization this was a golden age of bipartisanship at least in terms of the parties it used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals could all work together in congress they could rearrange themselves form bipartisan committees but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up the force field increased it became much harder for them to socialize much harder for them to cooperate retiring members nowadays say that it 's become like gang warfare it 's so that the bloods and the crips will know which side to vote for but for a while there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people well in the last twelve years it 's become much more apparent that it is and what they do on that survey is they ask what 's called a feeling thermometer rating so how warm or cold do you feel about the republican party the democratic party all sorts of groups in american life the blue line shows how warmly democrats feel about democrats and they like them you but actually when i first saw this data i was surprised that 's actually not so bad if you go back to the carter and even reagan administrations they were rating the other party 's not terrible it drifts downwards very slightly but it plummets something is going on here the moral electromagnet is turning back on and nowadays just very recently it 's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too it 's like put out in the two oceans and it 's pulling the whole country apart pulling left and right into their own territories like the bloods and the crips we will never again have a political class that was forged by the experience of fighting together in world war we will never again have just three television networks all of which are relatively centrist and we will never again have a large group of conservative southern democrats and liberal northern republicans making it easy making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan so for a lot of reasons those decades after the second world war were an historically anomalous time we will never get back to those low levels of polarization i believe but there 's a lot that we can do there are dozens and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly to things that congress did to itself in the 1990s that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional the first step is and when you have closed party primaries and only the most committed republicans and democrats are voting you 're nominating and selecting the most extreme but the problem isn 't primarily that we 're electing bad people to congress from my experience and from what i 've heard from from congressional insiders most of the people going to congress are good hard working intelligent people who really want to solve problems but once they get there they find that they are forced to play a game that rewards hyper partisanship and that punishes independent thinking you step out of line you get punished and if you step out of line if of social relationships in congress the politicians i 've met are generally very extroverted friendly very socially skillful people and that 's the way politics has always first the house of representatives changed its legislative calendar so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week nowadays congressmen fly in on tuesday morning they don 't meet each other 's spouses or children there 's no more relationship there and trying to run congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization so there 's a lot we can do but who 's going to push them to do it no labels and common cause i think have very good ideas for changes we need to do to make our democracy more responsive and our congress more effective but i 'd like to supplement their work with a little psychological trick nothing pulls people together especially an attack from a foreign enemy unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology in which case as i said before it can actually pull us apart sometimes a single threat can polarize us as we saw but what if the situation we face is not a single threat but is actually more like this where there 's just so much stuff coming in it 's this is where we are as a country we 've all seen versions rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy especially it destroys our ability to trust each other to feel that we 're all in the same boat because it 's obvious we 're not some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood we 're not all in the same boat and that means nobody 's willing to sacrifice for the common good the left has been screaming about this asteroid for thirty years now and the right says huh what hmm no problem no problem now why is that happening to us why is the inequality rising well one of the largest causes whites are headed that way too but it 's not just money it 's also stability versus chaos mom 's boyfriend is often a really really dangerous person for kids now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s and the left has been saying it 's not a problem it 's not a problem the left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children now let me be clear i 'm not blaming actually more critical of the men who won 't take responsibility for their own children and of an economic system that makes it difficult for many men to earn enough money to support those children the new york times finally noticed this asteroid with a front page story last july showing how the decline of marriage contributes we are becoming a nation of just two classes when americans go to college and marry each other they have very low divorce rates they earn a lot of money they invest that money in their kids some of them become tiger mothers the kids rise to their full potential and the kids go on to become the top two lines and then there 's everybody else the children who don 't benefit from a stable marriage who don 't have as much invested in them who don 't grow up in a stable environment and who go on to become the bottom three lines we 've got to start working on this we 've got to do something and what 's wrong with you people that you don 't see my threat but if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders but then you 're going to run smack into the problem that women don 't generally want to marry someone who doesn 't have a job so if you really care about strengthening families you might want to talk to some liberal groups who are working on promoting educational equality who are working on raising the minimum wage who are working on finding ways to stop so many men from being sucked into the criminal justice system and taken out of the marriage market so to conclude there are at least four asteroids headed our way please raise your hands almost all of you well congratulations you guys are the inaugural members of the asteroids club which is a club for all americans we don 't start by looking for common ground common ground is often very hard to find we start by looking for common threats because common threats make common ground now am i being naive is it naive to think that people could ever lay down their swords and left and right could actually work together such as this one such as to the village square in tallahassee florida which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate that sort of working together human relationship that 's necessary to solve florida 's problems americans on both sides care about global poverty and aids and on so many humanitarian and most surprisingly to me they sometimes can even see eye to eye on criminal justice for example the incarceration rate the prison population in this country has quadrupled and liberals are very concerned about this the southern poverty law center is often fighting the grover norquist isn 't because this system costs an unbelievable amount of money prison industrial complex is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls groups of fiscal conservatives and christian conservatives have come together to form a group called right and at times they have worked with the southern poverty law center to oppose the building of new prisons and to work for reforms that will make the justice system more efficient and more humane so this is possible we can do it let us therefore go to battle stations not to fight each other but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids and let our first mission be to press congress to reform itself before it 's too late for our nation"
