  "transcript": "a story i 'm a product of this visionary mother and father they belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents and girls would be dolled up to get married and my parents were part of a landed property family father defied his own grandfather almost to the point of disinheritance because he decided to educate all four of us children so this is the foundation time which i got i grew up and my father used to say at that time i 'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world i don 't know if he really meant [ that ] but it happened i and since i said they 're my role models i followed two things which my father and mother gave me one or you come down enjoy it learn from it ten are you can 't do a thing it 's like a death of a relative or a cyclone or a hurricane or an earthquake you can 't do a thing about it you 've got to just respond to the situation but that response comes out of those ninety points since i 'm a product of this philosophy to be valuing what i got i 'm a product of opportunities rare opportunities in the ' 50s and the ' 60s which girls didn 't get and i was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving service as a tough woman and then it was a new pattern of policing for me the policing stood for power to correct this is something like a new definition or power to punish but i decided no it 's a power to prevent i and i redefined policing concepts in india two journeys my policing journey and my prison journey what you see if you see the title called pm 's car held this was the first time a prime minister of india was given a parking ticket that 's the first time in india and i can tell you that 's the last time you 're hearing about it it 'll never happen again in india because now it was once and forever but so i 'm going to move on this is about tough policing equal policing postings which others would say no i now went to a prison assignment as a police officer normally police officers don 't want to do prison they sent me to prison to lock me up thinking now there will be no cars and no vips to be given tickets to let 's lock her up but ten thousand men of which only four hundred were women ten thousand nine thousand plus about six hundred rapists gangsters some of them i 'd sent to jail as as a police officer outside and then how did i deal with them the first day when i went in i didn 't know how to look and i said do you pray when i looked at the group i said do you pray they saw me as a young short woman wearing where everybody in this was initiated in delhi prison you see one sample of a prisoner every prisoner went into the education program the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten we converted this into an ashram from a prison to an ashram through education because there was no budget of education for the prison that 's the second landmark i want to show you some moments of history in my journey which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in this was a meditation program inside the prison of over one thousand prisoners one thousand prisoners who sat in meditation this was one of the most courageous steps i took as a prison governor and this is what transformed you want to know more about and write to me on because crime is a product of a distorted mind and they felt as if it was this is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison if you see somebody in the blue this guy he was a i 'm currently into movements movements of education of the under served children which is thousands india is all about thousands secondly is about the anti corruption movement in india that 's a big way we as a small group of activists have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of india friends you will hear a lot about it that 's the movement at the moment i 'm driving and that 's the movement and ambition of my life"
