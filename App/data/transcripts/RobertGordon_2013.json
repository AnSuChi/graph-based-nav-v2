  "transcript": "and the rutted dirt road turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains and we don 't travel any faster today because commercial so i started wondering and pondering could it be that the best years of american that leads to the suggestion maybe economic growth is almost over they 're powerful enough so we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline and here 's my theme because of the headwinds if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last one hundred and fifty years growth is cut in half if innovation is less powerful invents less great wonderful things then growth is going to be even lower than half of history now here 's eight centuries of economic growth the vertical axis is just percent per year of growth zero percent a year one percent a year two percent a year the white line is for the u k and then the u s takes over as the leading nation in the year one thousand nine hundred when the line switches to red you 'll notice that for the first four centuries there 's hardly any growth at all just zero point two percent then growth gets better and better it maxes out in the 1930s that is a forecast that i but you know what the actual facts are you know what the growth in per person income has been in the united states in the last six years what if i try to fit a curved line to this historical record but i decided i would end it at zero point two just like the u k growth for the first now the history that we 've achieved is that we 've grown at two point zero percent per year americans in the future can 't expect to be twice as well off as their parents or even a quarter [ more well off than ] their parents now we 're going to change and look at the level of per capita income the vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today 's prices now what if we could achieve that historic two percent growth for the next seventy years well it 's a matter of arithmetic two percent growth quadruples your standard of living in seventy that means we 'd go from forty four thousand to one hundred and eighty thousand well we 're not going to do that it 's a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity rises faster than output per hour if hours per person increased and we got that gift back in the ' 70s and ' 80s when women entered the labor force but now it 's turned and second because there 's been a very significant dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution the next headwind is education we 've got problems all over our educational system despite race to the top in college we have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt and our college completion rate is fifteen points fifteen percentage points we have a lot of debt our economy grew from two thousand to two thousand and seven on the back of consumers massively consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons why our economic recovery is so sluggish today and everybody of course knows that the federal government debt is growing as a share of gdp at a very rapid rate and the only way that 's going to stop is some combination of faster growth in taxes or slower in entitlements also called transfer payments over the fifteen years before the financial crisis the growth rate of the bottom ninety nine percent of the income distribution was half a point slower than the averages we 've been talking about before all the rest went to the top one and that zero point eight is the big challenge are we going to grow at zero point eight if so that 's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last one so let 's see what some of those inventions were if you wanted to read in they created pollution they created odors they were and they were a fire hazard by and then in addition to that at the same time hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and electric tools all achieved by electricity electricity was also very helpful in liberating women then they had to bring them in the whole thing took two days and then we had the but no they didn 't because electricity brought us the electric refrigerator back in the late 19th century the only source of heat in most homes was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating the bedrooms were cold without restraint twenty five to fifty pounds of manure on the streets every day together with a gallon of urine that comes out at five to ten tons daily per square mile in cities those horses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land that 's the percentage of american agricultural land it took when the motor vehicle was invented and back before the turn of the century women had another problem all the water for cooking cleaning and bathing but by cities around the country had put in underground water pipes they had put in and an amazing fact the rate of improvement of life expectancy was three times faster than it was in the second half of the so it 's a truism that things can 't be more than one hundred percent of themselves electrification central heat we went from it 's amazing the mainframe computer was invented in one thousand nine hundred and forty two by one thousand nine hundred and sixty we had telephone bills bank statements were being produced by computers the earliest cell phones the earliest personal computers were invented in fast forward through the ' 90s we had the dotcom revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth but i 'm now going to give you an experiment you have to choose either option a or option b option a is you get to keep everything invented up till and you get running water and indoor toilets or you get everything invented to yesterday including facebook maybe for a couple of days in some cases for more than a week electricity running water heating and a charge for their iphones the problem we face is that all these great inventions we have to match them in the future and my prediction that we 're not going to match them brings us down from the original two percent growth down to zero point two the fanciful curve that i drew you at the beginning so here we are back to the horse and buggy i 'd like to award an oscar and they 're going to call back to you your challenge is can you match what we achieved thank you"
