  "transcript": "i 'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment but when i started this over ten years ago so i wrapped the door handle i call this the alpha piece so clearly the reaction was interesting it intrigued me and i thought so i wrapped the stop sign pole near my house the reaction was wild people would park their cars and and get out of their cars and stare at it and scratch their heads and stare at it and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it and all of that was really exciting to me and i wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood and the more that i did the stronger the reaction so this is some of my early work and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a so i think we all see the humor in this but i wanted to know why i was letting this take over my life why i was passionate about it why were other people reacting so strongly to it and i realized something so when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that 's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually weirdly you find a connection to it so at this point my curiosity grew it went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can i do with this material can i do something so that 's when the bus happened this was a real game changer for me i 'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one so at this point i 'm experiencing or i 'm witnessing i may have started yarn bombing but i certainly don 't own it anymore it had reached global status people from all over the world were doing this and i know this because i would travel so as i pursued my own goals with my art this is a lot of my recent work so was yarn bombing yarn bombing was also and that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft and and showed me that there was this common language i had with the rest of the world it was through this granny hobby this unassuming hobby that i found commonality with people that i never thought i 'd have a connection with so as i tell my story and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered if you think about our hands these tools that are connected to us and what they 're capable of doing building houses and furniture and painting giant murals and most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone and i 'm totally guilty of this as well but if you think about it what would happen if you put those things down what would you make what would you create with your own hands so i didn 't think this was in the cards for me but i also know that i didn 't stumble upon this and so as we ponder the future thank you"
