  "transcript": "i 've been studying non state armed groups my goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation i work in the field in the policy world and in the library understanding non state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict because war has changed it used to be a contest between states no longer it is now a conflict for example of the two hundred and sixteen peace agreements signed between one thousand nine hundred and seventy five and two thousand and eleven one hundred and ninety six of them were between a state and a non state actor so we need to understand these groups we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful so how do we do that we need to know what makes these organizations tick we know a lot about armed struggle and unarmed politics are related it is all part of the same organization but since its creation in the early known for its suicide attacks against israel also runs the gaza strip since two thousand and seven so these groups do way more than just shoot armed groups also invest in complex looting but setting up profitable businesses for example construction companies they build stronger bonds with the population vocational training programs or micro loan programs hezbollah offers all of these armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing safety and security the initial rise of the taliban in war torn afghanistan now unfortunately in these the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population but in general providing social services fills a gap a governance gap left by the government and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power for example the two thousand and six electoral victory of the palestinian hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group 's social work yet in the west when we look at armed groups we only long term vision and they emerge to be both armed and political engage in violent struggle and provide governance and the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state they pick up the garbage they run the sewage system is this a state is it a rebel group and what about isis the lines are blurred and the more states are weak like in the middle east today the more non state actors step in and fill that gap this matters for governments because to counter these groups they will have to invest more in non military tools filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach this also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding if we better understand armed groups we will better know what so in this new contest between states and non states military power can win some battles but it will not give us peace nor stability to achieve these objectives thank you"
