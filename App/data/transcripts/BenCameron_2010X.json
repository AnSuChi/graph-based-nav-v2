  "transcript": "i am a cultural omnivore one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an ipod country singer josh turner gangsta rap artist kirk franklin concerti symphonies and more and more voracious reader a reader who deals with ian mcewan down to stephanie meyer i have read the twilight tetralogy and one who lives for my home theater a home theater where i devour dvds video on demand and a lot of television for me law & order svu tina fey and thirty rock and judge judy the people i 'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions especially my passion for judge judy and you 'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us but i 'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life a passion for the live professional performing arts performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire yes but jazz as well modern dance opera theater and more and more and more depending on who you read an arts organization or an artist who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer now competes with between three and we now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time gen xers spent twenty point seven hours online and tv the majority on tv gen yers spent even more twenty three point eight hours arrives at college already having spent twenty thousand hours online and an additional ten thousand hours playing video games thanks to the internet we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it delivered to our own doorstep we can shop at three in the morning or eight at night ordering jeans tailor made for our unique body types expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts which have set curtain times set venues attendant inconveniences of travel parking and the like simply cannot meet opera or ballet ticket when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet twenty four hours a day for ninety nine cents a song or for free these are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain but as particular as they feel to us we know we 're not alone all of us are engaged in a seismic fundamental realignment of culture and communications saddled in the performing arts as we are by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming 19th century many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of tower records and ask everyone i talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of adrienne rich who in whatever we do together is pure invention the maps they gave us are out of date by years and for those of you who love the arts aren 't you glad you brink of our own annihilation i prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation a reformation like the religious reformation of the 16th century the printing press really leading the charge on the religious do we need anyone to intermediate chris anderson someone i trust you all know editor in chief of wired magazine and author of the long tail really was the first for me to nail a lot of this he wrote a long time ago you know thanks to the invention of the internet in the 1930s if any of you wanted to make a movie you had to work for warner brothers or or rko because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more and now who in this room doesn 't know a fourteen year old hard at work on her second third or fourth movie again in the ' 30s warner brothers rko did that for you now go to youtube facebook you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy but by participation i believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity not opulence of dignity and they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home and indeed while we 've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional the single most exciting development in the last five to ten years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist the professional artist who works not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage but most frequently around women 's rights or human rights or on global warming issues or aids relief for more not out of economic necessity but out of a deep organic conviction that the work that she or he is called to do cannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment but by liz lerman 's dance exchange a professional dance company whose dancers range in age from eighteen to eighty two and who work with genomic scientists to embody the dna strand and with nuclear physicists at cern but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play where they explored the differences in faith and found commonality as an important first step toward helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration while today 's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more i think rather than being annihilated the performing arts are poised on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been you know we 've said for a long time we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town and absolutely i hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community dollars spent in restaurants or on parking at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes the piano the ability to listen deeply to have empathy especially now uninformed by social conscience we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters and especially characters of the young people who all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation rather than digested experience in reality tv that thrives on humiliation and in a context of analysis please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest to you when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion the arts whatever they do whenever they call us invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity god we need it now you know we 're bound together we work to promote healthy vibrant societies to ameliorate human suffering empathic world order i salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work whatever your purpose may be and i thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon"
