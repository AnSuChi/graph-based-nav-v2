  "transcript": "who here is either over sixty five years old or hopes to live past age parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past sixty five raise your hands please okay you are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value the rest of you won 't find my talk personally relevant but i think that you will still find the subject fascinating i 'm going to talk about growing older in this subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book which compares traditional small tribal societies with our large modern societies religion and speaking more than one language those tribal societies which constituted all human societies for most of human history they constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn but also they shouldn 't be romanticized as happy and peaceful we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves nevertheless the treatment of the elderly varies from much worse to much better than in our modern societies at the worst extreme many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they or by killing older people in which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents it happens mainly under two conditions one is in nomadic hunter gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can 't walk where there are periodic and for children to us americans it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father and the old people know what now is going to happen to them at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly the happy extreme and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world they remain valuable and they continue to live in the there are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people as regards usefulness older people continue to perform useful services one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food thereby freeing up their own adult of older people is in making tools weapons baskets pots and textiles in fact they 're usually the people who are best at it religion songs and dances older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern literate societies where our sources of information are books and the internet older people are the repositories of information it 's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience the other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society 's cultural values associated with confucius ' doctrine of filial piety which means obedience respect and support for elderly parents cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the they 're at a big disadvantage in hospitals our hospitals have an explicit policy called age based allocation of healthcare resources that sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients american hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u s so older people who are no longer working aren 't respected so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self reliant and independent which shows up even in our advertisements ads for coca cola and beer always depict smiling young people even though old as well as young people buy and drink coca cola and beer just think what 's the last time you saw a coke or beer ad depicting smiling people never instead the only american ads featuring white haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning well what has changed in the status of the elderly today there have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives we americans move on the average every carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the associated with work perhaps the biggest change for the worse when we want some information we look it up in a book or we google it instead of finding some old person to ask the slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old but and conversely we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society for i was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because i had memorized the multiplication tables and i know how to use logarithms and i 'm quick at manipulating a slide rule today though those skills are utterly useless because any idiot conversely i at age for everyday life my family 's first tv set in had only three knobs that i quickly mastered an on off switch a volume knob and a channel selector knob today just to watch a program on the tv set in my own house i have to operate a tv remote that utterly defeats me i have to telephone my 25 year old sons and ask them to talk me through it while i try to push those wretched forty one buttons what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u s and to make better use of their value that 's a huge problem in my remaining four minutes today i can offer just a few if they choose to do it as more young women enter the workforce compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers child care grandparents don 't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology at the same time older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change but that could come back for example only americans now in or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things but millions of older americans even if they don 't come back we have to be able to plan for them the remaining value of older people that i 'll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do there are other things that they can do better than younger people a challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing best left to scientists under the age of thirty hence older people are much better than younger people at long term plans i 've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their farmers lawyers and doctors in short many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern big societies paradoxically nowadays when we have more elderly people than ever before living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before the lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern american society but what 's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well of course i 'm not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to and perhaps to be learned from them although materially poorer their children they almost never die of diabetes heart features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as i found it to live in those societies"
