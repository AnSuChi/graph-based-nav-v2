  "transcript": "want to talk to you about two things tonight number one teaching surgery and second that language is one of the most profound things that separate us keep your hands up if you wanted an operation nobody wants an operation nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain but if you have to have an operation what you really want is a minimally invasive operation that 's what i want to talk to you about tonight how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator and it starts by putting people to sleep sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen it 's dangerous stuff and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen so let 's see what it looks like and you can see how focused the surgeons are how much concentration it takes you can see it in their faces it and it 's not all that easy to learn we do about five million of these in the united states and maybe twenty million of these worldwide all right you 've all heard the the term he 's a born surgeon let me tell you surgeons are not born surgeons are not made either there are surgeons are trained one step at a time starts with a foundation basic skills we build on that and we take people hopefully and when they do all of that for about five years they get the coveted board certification if you need surgery you want to be operated on by a surgeon you get your board certificate and eventually if you 're lucky you achieve mastery now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states sages started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the american board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified it it 's all of that now teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons no so to lift this education and training something i 'm very personally excited about we need to make the world a smaller place and i think that we can develop some tools to do so and one of the tools i like personally and he proved so here 's allan teaching an surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally let me bring it to you locally i work at the cambridge hospital it 's the primary if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients not just teaching surgeons just trying to talk to your patients there aren 't enough translators in the world we need to employ technology to assist us in this quest and there isn 't always a translator available one of the things that i want to leave you with we have a lot to learn here in the united states we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery and everywhere i go the barrier is we want this but we need it in our language so here 's what we think we want to do imagine giving a lecture europe accurately and it has to be bi directional they have to be able to teach us something as well it but nothing that 's good enough to teach because we need a lexicon what is a lexicon a lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain i need to have a health we have to work at it so let me show you what we 're doing this is research can 't buy it we 're it starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture and now we 've got the words and we can apply the special sauce we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic and we currently have access to eleven language pairs more to come and i 'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that don 't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful narrator fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery students may display captions in their native language steven schwaitzberg you click the i want it in spanish button but if you happen to be sitting in beijing at the same time by using technology in a constructive fashion you could get it in mandarin or you could get it in russian on and on and on simultaneously without the use of human translators it 's knowledge and skills the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand so we 're going to take it one step further we 've brought my friend allan back very good oscar i 'll see you next week ss so that 's what we 're working on we want it to be we have a need to learn as well as to teach i can think of a million uses for a tool like this as we think about intersecting technologies everybody has a cell phone with a camera translating videos this is a ubiquitous tool in order to break down our barriers we have to learn to talk to people to demand thank you very much"
