  "transcript": "up till the pretty much last few days but was denied access to a slide projector and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work unlike powerpoint and some other programs now i agree that you have to there are certain concessions and you know if you use a slide projector you 're not able to have the the bad type swing in from the back or the side or up or down but maybe that 's an o k trade off to trade that off for a focus it 's a thought just a thought and there 's something nice about slides getting stuck with that let 's get the first slide up here this as many of you have probably guessed is a recently emptied beer can in portugal fly all night i looked up and i thought wow how clean you come into this major airport and they simply have a b i mean how nice is that everything 's gotten simpler in design and here 's this i went back to the same airport same plane i think and looked up and it said c it was only then that i realized it was simply a gate that i was coming into i 'm a big believer in the the message that 's sent before somebody begins to read before they get the rest of the information what is the emotional response they get to the product to the story to the painting whatever it is that area of design interests me the most and i think this for me is a real clear very simplified version situated next to each other so here 's the first door take a look at the second door and see if there 's any different message o k which one would you park in front of same color same message same words the only thing that 's different is the expression that the individual door owner here put into the piece yet it doesn 't say that it doesn 't need to say that i would probably park in front of the other one i 'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so it 's gotten so simple that it 's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive but i was in milan and saw this street sign and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist laughter and then moved on he didn 't overpower it like they have a tendency to do i took some photos and this is and i would argue that it 's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention getting you to look over that way and hopefully you don 't stop and buy those awful pecan things stuckey 's this is from my second book the first book is called the end of print and it was done working with william burroughs and the end of print is now in its fifth printing when i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it he said no he said he didn 't believe it was the end of and i said well that 's fine i just would love to have your input on this film and and this book and he finally agreed to it and says in this great voice that i can 't mimic but i 'll kind of try but not really apparently when photography was perfected there were people going around saying that 's it you 've just ruined painting people are just going to take pictures now that wasn 't the case so this is from 2nd sight a book i did on intuition i think it 's not the only ingredient in design but possibly the most important it 's something everybody has it 's not a matter of teaching it in fact most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can 't quantify it it 's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter so it tends to get discounted this is a quote the intellect has little to do on the road to discovery there comes a leap in consciousness call it intuition or what you will and the solution just comes to you and you don 't know from where or why the further the answer gets from you and the minute you stop thinking about it your intuition gives you that answer in a sense like this for a couple of reasons if you 've had any design courses they would teach you you can 't read this i think you eventually can and more importantly i think it 's true don 't mistake legibility for communication just because something 's legible doesn 't means it communicates more importantly it doesn 't mean it communicates the right thing so what is the message sent before and i think that 's this is working with marshall mcluhan i stayed and worked with his and we we came up with close to six hundred quotes from marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times predicting so much of what has happened in the and so this book is called and it 's a lot of them are never have never been published before and basically i 've interpreted the different quotes ended up cutting it down considerably it 's just under four hundred pages now but i decided i liked this contents page i liked the way it looks so i kept it i think in there they are nature fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property which had never been done before printing when new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies anxieties of all kinds result while people are engaged in creating a totally different world they always form vivid images of the preceding world i hate this stuff it 's hard to read except the globe and no possible occupation except information gathering and i had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house i bought in la that the real estate person hadn 't pointed out there was some bomb shelter built apparently in the ' 60s cuban missile crisis and i asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by and he goes it 's something to do with the sewage system i was o k that 's i finally went down there and it was this old rusted circular thing and two beds and very kind of creepy and weird and also surprisingly it was done in kind of a cheap metal and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere and spiders and i thought you know what were they thinking you 'd think maybe cement possibly or something but anyway i and i 've also now fixed trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web so this is a six shot sequence and then the tiny line of copy says if you want to see this entire sequence how this whole ride was go to the website and got no way of tracking it so i could be totally wrong i don 't have the site it 's just the piece itself this is a group in new york called the coalition for a smoke free environment asked me to do these posters were wild posted around new york city you can 't really well you can 't see it at all but the second line is really the more kind of payoff in a sense it says if the cigarette companies can lie then so can we grunge type or something it looked like they might be real anyway this amazes me this is a product i just found out i was in the this was either an old product with new packaging i do a lot of workshops all over the world really and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors i felt this was one of the more successful just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom i did some work for microsoft a few years back it was a worldwide branding campaign and it was interesting to me my background is in sociology i had no design training and sometimes people say well that explains it they thought some people didn 't like them i found out that 's very true working on this campaign worldwide and our goal was to try to humanize them a bit and what i did was add type and people to the ad which the previous campaign had not had and nobody remembered them and nobody referenced them and we were trying to say that hey some of these guys that work there are actually ok some of them actually have friends and family and they 're and the umbrella campaign was thank god it 's monday so we tried to take this what was perceived as a negative long working hours and turn it into a positive and not run from it and but anyway this is one of the ads i was most pleased with and this is how the ad ran around the world in germany they made one small change without checking with me nor did they have to because it was done through agencies but see if you can tell the difference this is how the ad ran throughout the world germany made one slight change in the ad now there 's kind of two issues here if you 're going to put a kid in the ad pick one that looks just have a feeling this kid 's been there for a week you know he 's just really hoping that boots up and you know and then as the agency explained to me they said look we don 't have little green people in our country why would we put little green people in our i understand their logic i totally disagree with it i think it 's a very small minded approach the world is certainly much more global and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer though listen to the music and try to interpret it there 's no grid there 's no system there 's nothing set up in and it 's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music this is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in in school there 's a lot of great writing in ray gun and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books article on bryan ferry just really boring article so i set the whole article in dingbat you could make it helvetica or something it is the actual article i suppose you could eventually decode it but it 's really not very well written it really wouldn 't be worthwhile having done a lot of magazines very curious how big magazines handle big stories and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle nine eleven and i was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we 'd already seen a million times which was basically the moment of impact and people magazine i thought got probably the best shot it 's kind of horsey type but the texture the second plane not quite hitting there was something more enticing and on the right we learn that there 's a new way to support your breast the coveted right hand page was not given up to the whole issue look at the image of this lady who knows what she 's going through and the copy says he knows just how to give me goosebumps yeah he jumps out of buildings it 's this says one clean fits all there were a lot of orphans made this day and here 's a dead body being just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more both facing the same way both wearing jeans and i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that they actually emailed me and they said they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event it had been a few months this was what they found on their car very few times you 'd be happy to find this on your car but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back this is my desktop somebody told me today there was this thing called folders but i don 't know what my notes for the talk there might be a correlation here we are wrapping up this i saw on the plane flying in for hot new products i 'm not sure this is an improvement or a good idea because like if you don 't spend quite enough time in front of your computer you can now get a plate in the keyboard so there 's no more faking it that you don 't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway now there 's a plate and it would be really really convenient to get a piece of pizza then type a little bit if you ever doubt the power of graphic design this is a very generic sign that literally says vote for hitler it says nothing the importance of people becomes more than it 's ever been before you have to utilize who you are in your work nobody else can do that nobody else can pull from your background from your parents your upbringing your whole life experience if you allow that to happen it 's really the only way you can do some unique work this is i like found art hand lettering 's coming back in a big way and i thought this was a great example of both this lady 's advertising for her lost pit bull it 's friendly she 's underlined friendly that 's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles she can 't spell and i 'm thinking yeah right i 'll go look for a lost pit bill for twenty bucks i have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for hercles and you get charged by this thing and you go oh please be hercles please be the friendly one i 'm sure she never found the dog because i took the sign but i and i remembered seeing this photograph they told you that there was a forty to fifty percent chance of death on the job that 's pretty high for most occupations but you know the government would make a plane they 'd say go see if that one flies would you some of them did some of them"
