  "transcript": "what if i told you there was a new technology reduced pain and suffering reduced anesthetic times had the ultimate dose response curve that the more you did it the better it benefitted patients here 's a kicker it has no side effects and it 's available no matter where care is delivered i can tell doctor at boston children 's hospital this would be a game changer for me that technology is lifelike this lifelike rehearsal is being delivered through medical simulation i thought i would start with a case just to really describe the the challenge ahead and why this technology is not just this is a her heart rate is going up her blood pressure is going down she 's breathing very very fast and the reason for this is displayed in this chest and you can see how there 's sort of as a result they 're pushing on the lungs and making it very difficult for this poor baby to breathe but before she can go to the operating room she must get whisked away to the icu where i work i work with surgical teams we gather around her and we place this child we make a tiny little incision in the neck we place catheters into the major vessels of the neck and i can tell you that these vessels are about the size of a pen the tip of a pen and it goes back into the body we save her life and get her safely to the operating room here 's the problem these disorders what is known is congenital diaphragmatic hernia even in the best hands in the world there is still a challenge to get the volume the natural volume of these patients in order to get our expertise curve at one hundred percent they just don 't present that often so how do you make the rare common here 's the other problem in the health care system that i trained for over twenty years it 's based on this and implicit in this model i don 't need to tell you this is that we practice on the very patients that we are delivering care to that 's a problem i think there 's a better approach medicine may very well be the last high stakes industry that does not practice prior to game time i want to describe to you a better approach through medical simulation this is nuclear power nuclear power runs scenarios training on scenarios that we hope will never occur but we know if they did they would be prepared for the worst so again if that ever were to happen these rare rare events ready to act on the drop of a dime i guess the most compelling for me in some ways is the sports industry arguably high stakes perhaps a simulator in baseball they 're not on the real field but they 're on a simulated field and they 're playing in the pregame season then they make their way to the field during the season games and what 's the first thing they do before they start the game they go into the batting cage and do batting practice for hours having different types of pitches being thrown at and here 's the most phenomenal part of this the batter gets into the batter 's box the pitcher gets ready to pitch right before the pitch is thrown what does that batter do the batter steps out of the box and takes a he wouldn 't do it any other way i want to talk to you about how we 're building practice swings like this in medicine we are building batting cages for the patients that we care about at boston children 's i want to use this case that we recently built it 's the case of a four year old who had a progressively enlarging head and as a result had loss of developmental milestones neurologic milestones and the reason for this problem is here it 's called hydrocephalus so a quick quick study in neurosurgery there 's the brain and you can see the cranium surrounding the brain what surrounds the brain between the brain and cranium is something called cerebrospinal fluid or fluid which acts as a shock absorber in your heads right now there is cerebrospinal much like a traffic jam as a result the fluid accumulates it has difficulty growing the child loses neurologic milestones this is a devastating disease in children the cure for this but some great news that advances in neurosurgical care have allowed us to develop minimally invasive approaches led into the deep brain structure and cause a little hole in a membrane that allows all that fluid to drain much like it would in a sink all of a sudden the brain is no longer under and there are no good training methods to get really good at getting this scope to the right place but and they 've come up with training models here 's the current training model i kid you not and what surgeons do is they stick a scope into the pepper and they do what is called a they use this scope to remove seeds and that is a way to get under their belts the rudimentary components of doing this surgery then they head right into the apprenticeship model seeing many of them as they present themselves we can do a lot better we are manufacturing reproductions of children in order for surgeons and surgical teams to rehearse in the most relevant possible ways let me show you this here 's my team this is an amazing team of individuals they take primary data from translate it into digital information animate it put it together into the components of the child itself and then take this digital data and be able to output it on the micron detail of what the child 's anatomy will look like you can see here the skull of this child being printed but we could not do this work without our dear friends on the west coast in hollywood california these are individuals that are incredibly talented at being able to recreate reality it was not a long it 's just that the actors are not actors they 're real doctors and nurses so these are some this is justin raleigh and his group this is not one of our patients bringing their group to boston children 's hospital sending our group out to hollywood california and exchanging around this to be able to develop these type of simulators what i 'm about to show you is a reproduction of this child you 'll notice here that every hair on the child 's head this is also that reproduced child and i apologize for any queasy but that is a reproduction and simulation of the child they 're about to operate on here 's that membrane we had talked about the inside of this child 's brain and on the other side the simulator as i mentioned a scope a little camera needs to make its way down and you 're seeing that here it needs to make a small hole in this membrane and allow this fluid to seep out i won 't do a quiz show to see who thinks which side is which but on the right is the simulator so surgeons can now produce training opportunities do these surgeries as many times as they want to their heart but combining that skill but that is very quickly going to be incorporated experiences now as a full team orchestrating the exchange of tires and getting this car back on the speedway we 've taken the simulator i just described to you we 've brought it into the operating room at boston children 's hospital and these individuals these native teams let me show that to you we use the same technologies that are used in lean and six sigma and we bring them out and talk about what went right but more deliberative batting practice in the moments when it matters most let 's go back to this case now same child but now let me describe how we care for this child at boston children 's hospital this child was born at three o 'clock in the morning we assembled the team and brought that team to the virtual bedside to a simulated bedside the same team that 's going to operate on this child in the hours ahead and we have them do imagine this so now the conversations that i have with families imagine this conversation not only do we take care of this disorder frequently in but and now we 're prepared to take them back to the operating room so a new technology in health care lifelike thank you"
