  "transcript": "but i 'm very suspicious of all of these and so i have to figure this out for myself i have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self actualized local cows on my counter top but can i use a paper now if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times i don 't have a whole lot of embodied energy until i wash that yogurty towel this is now operating energy unless i use a unless you 're like me and you leave the handle in the position of hot even when you turn it on and then you start to use more energy or worse you let it run until it 's warm to rinse out your towel and now all bets are off so what this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect the position in which you put the handle have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you were trying to optimize now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house we wanted to know how green could we be and there 's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade offs and they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room now the average house has about three hundred megawatt hours of embodied energy in it this is the energy it takes to make it so first we and so this is framing lumber materials we then go on to the first thing that was very surprising if we put aluminum windows in this house we would double the energy use right there now spray foam is an excellent insulator it fills in all the cracks but it is pretty high embodied energy and sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that we also used straw bale infill for our library and then you get to the finishes the subject of all of those go green articles and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all and yet all the press is focused on that if you put carpeting in your house it 's about a tenth of embodied energy of the entire house unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy and we 've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this we have poured one hundred and fifty one megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before and so if i run my new energy efficient house forward compared with the old house we make it back in about six years i probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient and in that case it would take me more about twenty years to break even now if i hadn 't paid attention to embodied it would have taken us over fifty years to break even compared to the upgraded house so what does this mean on the scale of my portion of the house this is equivalent to about as much as i drive in a year but all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog and remember it 's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are"
