  "transcript": "like to take you on the epic quest of the rosetta spacecraft this has been my passion for the past two years in order to do that i need to explain to you something about the origin of the solar system according to theory is that when the earth had cooled down a bit after its formation comets massively impacted the earth and they probably also delivered complex organic material to earth the big planets like jupiter and saturn they were not in their place where they are now and they interacted gravitationally and they swept the whole interior of the solar system clean and what we now know as comets ended up in something called the kuiper belt and then the gravity of jupiter pulls these comets and haven 't changed deep frozen versions of our solar system so what 's important to remember comets contain the original material from which our solar system was formed bootstrapped life esa set up its long term horizon two thousand program which contained one cornerstone which would be a mission to a comet in parallel a small mission to a comet what you see here giotto was launched and flew by the comet of halley with an armada of other spacecraft from the results of that mission it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system and thus the rosetta mission was approved in one thousand nine hundred and ninety three however our p r department in its enthusiasm had already made one thousand delft blue plates with the name of the wrong comets so i 've never had to buy any china since that 's the positive part we left earth in two thousand and four to the this particular comet has been in the solar system throughout its whole tour through the solar system closest approach to the sun it 's the first ever landing on a comet we actually orbit the comet using something which is not normally done with spacecraft normally you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are in this case that 's not enough we navigated by looking at landmarks on the recognized features boulders craters and that 's how we know where we are respective to the comet now this sounds more heroic than it actually is because the technology to use radio isotope thermal generators wasn 't and these are not specially selected small people they 're just like you and me laughter we have two of these wings you find out that sixty five square meters of sail close to a body which is outgassing because we had to go there for the rosetta scientific objectives very far away four times the distance of the earth to the sun and also at a much higher velocity than we could achieve with fuel and we also flew by two asteroids lutetia and steins then in two thousand and eleven we got so far from the sun that if the spacecraft got into trouble we couldn 't actually everything was switched off except for one clock actually you get more and more and more elliptical and we had to start doing the rendezvous this is the moon rising over earth and this is what we now call a selfie which at that time by the way that word didn 't exist and it just looks under the solar arrays and you see the planet mars and the solar array in the distance we started arriving at a distance of two million kilometers from the comet in may however and you see here some of them were really big we had to brake the first one by a few hundred kilometers and it used two hundred and eighteen kilos of fuel and we had to close off a branch so the system was actually operating at a pressure which it was never designed or qualified for this is not going to be an easy thing to land on we had hoped for some kind of thing where you could easily land but we had one hope no that didn 't work either so at that point in time it was clearly unavoidable we had to map this body in all the detail you could get because we had to find an area which is five hundred meters in that 's the error we have on landing the so we went through this process and we mapped the comet we used a technique called photoclinometry you use shadows thrown by the sun what you see here is a rock sitting on the surface of the comet and the sun shines from above from the shadow we with our brain can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is you can program that in a computer you then cover the whole comet for that we flew special trajectories starting in august and we repeated the whole thing at fifty kilometers and we could use this technique to map this led to a selection of landing sites this whole process we had to do to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site we didn 't have more to give you an idea the average mars mission takes hundreds of scientists for years to meet about where shall we go we had sixty days and that was it we finally selected the final landing site and the commands were prepared for the way this works is that rosetta has to be at the right point in space and aiming towards the comet because the lander is passive the lander is then pushed out and moves towards the comet rosetta had to turn around to get its cameras to actually look if the seven and its location in space better than one hundred meters at five hundred million kilometers from earth but it 's got everything we can sniff gas we can measure everything this is one of the results from an instrument which measures gas density at the position of rosetta so there is one and we can see the density variations of this these are the gases and the organic compounds that we already have measured you will see it 's an impressive list and there is much much much more in houston at the moment where many of these results are presented and they shot it with tantalum so we learned things about which materials were there when the planet was made of course one of the important elements is the imaging this is one of the cameras of rosetta the osiris camera and this actually was the cover of science magazine on january twenty three of this year nobody had expected this body to look like this boulders rocks if anything it looks more like the half dome in yosemite than anything else it may be local outgassing so there is a lot apparently at the bottom of these pits is where the active regions are and where the material evaporates into space you see it and it 's two and a half meters wide some people suggest that actually when we get close to the sun the comet may split in two and then we 'll have to choose which comet do we go for the lander mostly comparable except for the things which hammer in the ground and drill etc but much the same as rosetta and that is because you want to compare what you find in space with what these are called ground truth measurements you see the lander getting further and further away from rosetta so this is one of the last images we took and you see three blown ups from the bottom left to the middle then at the top there is a before and an after image of the landing the only problem with the after image is there is no lander but if you carefully look at the right hand side of this now on that was discarded because it was way too expensive now we forgot but the lander knew during the first bounce in the magnetometers you see here the data from them from the three axes x y and z somewhere we hit the edge it 's a standing on a comet this for me is one of the very best images of space science i have ever seen one of the things we still have to do is to actually find the lander but the search is continuing as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work so it looks like a very big rock but it 's not the activity increase we saw in june july august last year was a four fold activity increase by the time we will be at the sun there will be one hundred kilos a second i will never forget absolute madness two hundred and fifty tv crews in germany the the discovery channel crew and i still feel this for a month and a half i would like to leave you thank you"
