  "transcript": "i think i 've done sixty thousand but without leaving my desk and the reason i can do that is because i 'm actually two and at the same time my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed cyber frank so because i do business stuff so it 's important that we focus on outcomes and then i struggled because i was thinking to myself what should i talk what should i do it 's a ted audience so let 's just walk our way through this please could you work this through with me you can shout out the answer if you like the question is which of these horizontal lines is longer the answer is audience the same eddie obeng no they 're not the same do you remember 21st century somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works when i 'm joking i try and explain it happened so that the way to successfully run a business an organization or even a country has been deleted flipped idea is that so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize but which no longer exists you don 't believe me do you okay so if you search amazon for the word if you add the word consultants it doubles to sixty statistically what you discover is that about one in one hundred thousand ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception it companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets if you look at however if i use as an example what i want you to think about is their budget is only three thousand pounds of expenses the family actually end up in makassar south sulawesi at a cost of four thousand it gets even worse than that let me just walk you through this one this is a quote and i 'll just pick words out of it it says the failure to foresee the timing extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of of creativity and the number of bright minds or something like that this was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the queen of england when she asked the question why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming i 'll never get my knighthood i 'll never get my knighthood that 's not the important point the thing you have to remember is these are eminent economists on the planet do you see the challenge it 's scary and then i ask myself why was it ever small what 's going on i think what 's happened perhaps technology we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change the speed is accelerating that 's not the only thing at the same time as we 've done that we 've done something really weird we 've doubled the population in forty years put half of them in cities then connected them all up so they can interact the density of the interaction of human there are charts which show all these movements of information that density of information is amazing and then we 've done a third thing you know for those of you who have as an office a size and scale are no longer the same and then add to that every time you tweet over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own global is the new scale we know that it 's reality as a young engineering student i remember going to a demonstration where they basically the demonstrator did something quite intriguing what he did was he got a so effectively what you had was you had a situation where i 'll try and draw the so the water and he connects this to a so guess what happens a thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe it so it starts coming back in and nothing changes so he 's changing the flow of the water but it 's and then something weird happens there 's this the whole of that green line disappears what 's happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it they 've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent all the rules are in that environment instantly all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available and it 's not the same as laminar you 'd never notice because somebody has actually increased and it 's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff the speed the scale and the density of but because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle and you believe it will last and that 's how we used to do it we could see things understand take the time to put them into practice out here is the world if you work for a corporation you 'll discover it 's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn 't approve of isn 't in the strategy and anyway you 've got to go through your monthly meetings because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go so it 's likely that the line in terms of learning is pretty the point at which the lines cross over the pace of change so what does creativity and ideas i mentioned that earlier all the ceos around me my clients they want innovation so they seek innovation they say to people take risks and be creative but unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air entering their ears what they hear is do crazy things and then i 'll fire you why because because you should probably be fired on the other hand you 're doing something new no one 's ever done before because you can 't put it"
