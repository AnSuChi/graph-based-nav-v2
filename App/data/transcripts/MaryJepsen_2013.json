  "transcript": "i 'm actually an engineer i recently joined google and the brain science work i 'm speaking about today is work i did before i joined google and on the side outside of google so are you still smart or not and if not can you make yourself smart again and i had to deal with that it wasn 't the grey matter but it was the gooey part dead center that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters i had to decide what amounts of each of over a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day because if i just took nothing i would die within hours every day now for eighteen years every single day i 've had to i 'm an experimentalist at heart so i decided i would experiment to try to find more optimal dosages because there really isn 't a clear road map on this that 's detailed i began to try different mixtures and i was was blown away by how tiny changes in dosages dramatically changed my sense of self my sense of who i was my thinking my behavior towards people one particularly dramatic case for a couple months i actually tried dosages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s and i was blown away by how my thoughts changed and i thought i was the smartest person in the entire world and of course over the years i 'd met guys kind of like that or maybe kind of toned down versions of that i was kind of extreme i was actually trying with a little bit of insecurity and it just didn 't come out that way so i i couldn 't handle it i changed my dosages but that experience i think gave me a new appreciation for men and what they might walk through and i 've gotten along with men a a lot better since then what i was trying to do with tuning these hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my illness and surgery and i think mostly in images and so for me that became a key metric how to get these mental images that i use as a way of rapid prototyping if you will my ideas trying on different new ideas for size playing out scenarios this kind of thinking isn 't new philiosophers like hume and descartes and hobbes saw things they thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing so after several years i tuned myself up and i have lots of great really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication and the analytical backbone behind them and so now i 'm working on how can i get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster can you imagine if you will a movie director being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her and the truth is the remaining bottleneck in being able to do this is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems both used technology functional magnetic resonance imaging technology to image the brain and here is a brain scan set from giorgio ganis and his colleagues at harvard and the left hand column shows a brain scan of a person looking at an image middle column shows the brainscan of that same individual imagining seeing that same image and the right column was created by subtracting the middle column from the left column showing the difference to be nearly zero this was repeated on lots of different individuals with lots of different so let me set this up for you in this experiment individuals were shown hundreds of hours of youtube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences then a new movie was shown with new images new people new animals in it and a new scan set was recorded the computer using brain scan data alone decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was this is the we are so close to being able to do this we just need to up the resolution and now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image it creates the same brain scan brain scan systems available today and their resolution has increased really about a thousandfold in the last several years next we need to increase the resolution another thousandfold to get a deeper glimpse i 'm not for that there 's a lot of new imaging techniques being proposed some even by me but given the recent success of mri but at this point bigger magnets only offer incremental resolution improvements not the thousandfold we and with these magnets we we can actually create patterns as is shown here by shifting things we can create much more complicated structures with with slightly different arrangements kind of like making spirograph really but yet most of the recent advances in resolution have actually come from let 's also instead of a uniform magnetic field put down structured magnetic patterns in addition to the f m radio frequencies so by combining the magnetics patterns with the patterns in the and on top of that we can then layer our ever growing knowledge of brain structure and memory but the hormones and neurotransmitters i 've talked could you imagine if we could leapfrog language and communicate directly with human thought and how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought regardless pick a year will it happen in five years or fifteen years it 's hard to imagine it thank you"
