  "transcript": "and in particular i want to talk about the design of diarrhea and when evolutionary biologists talk about design they really mean design by natural selection and that brings me to the title of the talk using evolution to design disease organisms intelligently and i also have a little bit of a sort of smartass how they actually look at one 's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine you actually see a great potential but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf and may actually be very resistant all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions why are some disease organisms more harmful and a very closely related question which is how can we take control of this situation once we understand the answer to the first question how can we make and the focus when i 'm talking about the diarrheal organisms as well as the focus when i 'm talking about any organisms that cause acute infectious disease is to think about the problem from a germ 's point of view and in particular to think about a fundamental idea which i think makes sense out of a tremendous amount and that idea is that from the germ 's eye point of view disease organisms have to get from one host to another and often they have to rely on the of the host to move them to another host but not always sometimes you get disease organisms that don 't rely on host mobility at all for transmission and when you have that then evolutionary theory tells us that natural selection will favor the more exploitative more so natural selection will favor organisms that are more likely to cause damage if instead transmission to another host requires host mobility then we expect that the winners of the competition will be the and actual selection favors pathogens that take advantage of those hosts the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts for their own then it 's the benign ones that tend to be the winners going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways they can be transmitted from person to person contact these pathogens don 't rely on a healthy host for transmission a person can be sick in bed and still even hundreds of other individuals to sort of illustrate that this diagram and then the water may move into sources of drinking water people will come in to those places where you 've got contaminated drinking water bring things back to the family may drink right at that point the whole point and so the theory tells us that tend to be more harmful and the answer is yep they are now i put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs lot of them here i can tell the main point here is that those data points all show a very strong positive association between and how harmful they are how much death they cause per untreated infection to me suggests that we really need to ask some additional questions remember the second question that i raised at the outset was you could cause disease organisms to shift from the right hand side of that graph to the left hand side of the graph but it doesn 't tell you how long then it might be a very important way to control some of the nasty problems that we haven 't been able to control in other words as i was thinking about this i focused on this organism which is the el tor biotype of the organism called vibrio cholerae and that is and the reason i thought this is a really great organism to look at is that we understand why it 's so harmful it 's harmful because it produces a toxin and that toxin is released when the organism gets into our intestinal tract it causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine into the lumen the internal chamber of our intestine and then that fluid goes the only way it can which is out the other end and it flushes out thousands of different other competitors that would otherwise make life difficult for the vibrios you might find a million diarrheal organisms if the organism produced a lot of toxin you might find ten million or one hundred million if it didn 't produce a lot of this toxin the task is to try to figure out how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted now i can think of some of some possible experiments one would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism some that produce a lot of toxins some that produce a little and you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there there you expect these organisms to evolve towards a high level of harmfulness right there 's a little ethical problem in this i was hoping to hear a few gasps at least that makes me worry a little bit but anyhow the laughter makes me feel a little bit better this is what we 're really talking about here 's a girl who 's almost dead she got rehydration therapy she perked up within a few days she was looking like a completely different person so we don 't want to run an experiment like that but interestingly thousand now and i didn 't have anything to do with it i promise you i don 't think anybody knows but i 'm not averse once that 's happened to see whether or not the prediction that we would make that i did make before actually holds up did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like chile and did it with funding i got a lot of strains from these different countries and we measured their toxin production in the lab and we found that in chile within two months of the invasion of peru you had strains entering chile and when you look at those strains in the very far left hand side of this graph you see a lot of variation in the toxin production each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person a lot of variation on which natural selection can act but the interesting point is if you look over the 1990s within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild they evolved to produce less toxin and to just give you a sense of how important this might be if we look in one thousand nine hundred and ninety five we find that there 's only one case of cholera on average reported from chile every two years so it 's controlled that 's how much we have in america cholera that 's acquired endemically and we don 't think we 've they solved the problem in chile and in ecuador remember this is the place where it has the highest potential waterborne transmission it looked like it got more harmful in every case there 's a lot of variation but something about the environment the people are living in and i think the only realistic explanation is that it 's the favored the harmful strains in one place so that even though people then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance and the is very simple if you 've got a harmful organism a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics you 've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance so you get and if you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence by cleaning up the water supply you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease in antibiotic resistance so we can go to the same countries and look and see whereas did ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem if but if we look at the end of the 1990s just and they got no development of antibiotic resistance now these ideas should apply and the example i want to deal with is now malaria 's transmitted by a mosquito and normally if you 're infected with malaria and you 're feeling sick but i think there 's a really fascinating example of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this in the case of waterborne transmission we 'd like to clean up the water supplies see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness in the case of malaria what we 'd like to do is mosquito proof houses and the logic 's a little more subtle here if you mosquito proof houses when people get sick they 're sitting in bed or in mosquito proof hospitals they 're sitting in a hospital bed then you 're a loser the only pathogens that get transmitted are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy to walk outside and get mosquito bites and that experiment was done in northern alabama just to give you a little perspective on this i 've given you a star at the intellectual center of the united states which is right there in louisville kentucky and this really cool experiment was done about two hundred miles south of there in northern alabama by the tennessee valley authority they had dammed up the tennessee river they 'd caused and when you get stagnant water you get mosquitoes they found in the late ' 30s ten years after they 'd made these dams that the people in northern alabama were infected with malaria about a third a third to half of them were infected with malaria this shows you the positions of some of these dams ok so the tennessee valley authority was in a little bit of a bind there wasn 't ddt there wasn 't chloroquines what do they do well they decided to mosquito proof every house in northern alabama and within three years about one hundred dollars per house they mosquito proofed every house and so what and this was incidentally published in one thousand nine hundred and forty nine in the leading textbook of malaria called boyd 's malariology but almost no malaria experts because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses now i would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places like you know just as you get into the malaria zone sub saharan africa but as you move to really intense biting rate areas like nigeria you so to me it 's an experiment that 's waiting to happen and if it confirms the prediction then we should have a very powerful tool in a way much more powerful than the kind of tools we 're looking at because most of what 's being done today is to rely on things like anti malarial drugs and we know that although it 's great to make those anti malarial drugs available at really low cost and when you make them highly available you 're going to get resistance to those drugs and so it 's a short term solution this i 'm suggesting here this table i given just to emphasize that i 've only talked about two examples but as i said earlier this kind of logic applies across the board for infectious diseases and it ought to and so if you do something with those systems they 're going to evolve one way or another and all i 'm saying is that we need to figure out how they 'll evolve so that we need to so i don 't really have time to talk about those things but i did want to put them up there just to give you a sense that there really are solutions and this this links up with a lot of the how do you really lower sexual transmission of hiv what this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area it may get lowered if we intervene in ways that encourage people to stay more faithful to partners and so on but the key thing is to figure out how to lower it because if we lower it we 'll get an evolutionary change the virus and the data really do support this that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness and that will just add to the besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease is that often the kinds of interventions that you want that it indicates should be done are the kinds of interventions interventions that people want anyhow but people just haven 't been able to justify the cost then so that we can actually even though if you just look at the frequency of infection you would suggest that you can 't solve the problem well enough just by cleaning up water supply"
