  "transcript": "he was family history says he loved being a fireman and so in one thousand nine hundred and thirty eight on one of his days off he elected to hang out at the firehouse and one of the fire hose nozzles a giant heavy piece of metal toppled off a shelf and hit him a few days later his shoulder started to hurt two days after that he spiked a fever the fever climbed and climbed his wife was taking care of him but nothing she did made a difference and when they got the local doctor in nothing he did mattered either they flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital the nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection what at the time they would have called blood poisoning and though they probably didn 't say it they would have known right away that there was nothing they could do the first the first antibiotic was three years in the future people who got infections either recovered if they were lucky or they died dehydrated and delirious sinking into a coma as his organs failed his condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to he was thirty years old if you look back through history most people died the way my great uncle died the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the west today they didn 't die of those diseases because they didn 't live long enough to develop them shot on a battlefield crushed in one of the new factories of the industrial revolution and most of the time from infection which finished what those injuries began all of that changed when antibiotics arrived suddenly infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days it seemed like a miracle and ever since we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs and now we are coming to an end of it my great uncle died in the last days of the era we stand today on the threshold of the era in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one joe had will kill people once again in fact they already are people are dying of infections again because of a phenomenon called antibiotic resistance briefly it works like this bacteria compete against each other for resources for food by manufacturing lethal compounds that they direct against each other evolve defenses against that chemical attack when we first made antibiotics we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them and bacteria responded penicillin was distributed in and resistance to it just a year later in two thousand and four we played a game of leapfrog our drug and their resistance and then another drug and then resistance again and now the game is ending bacteria develop resistance so there are infections moving across the world for which out of the more than one hundred antibiotics available on the market two drugs might work with side effects or one drug or none this is what that looks like identified a single case in a hospital in north carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs today that infection known as europe and the middle east doctors in sweden diagnosed a man from india with a different infection resistant to all but one drug that time the gene that creates that resistance known as europe and canada and the it would be natural to hope fifty thousand people a year die of infections which no drugs can help a project chartered by the british government known as the review on antimicrobial resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is seven hundred thousand deaths a year that is a lot of deaths the chances are good that you don 't feel at risk that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of people whose infections are remote from us in situations we can 't identify with what you didn 't think about none of us do is that antibiotics support almost all of modern life here 's what else we 'd lose first any protection for people with weakened immune systems aids patients premature babies joint replacements how many athletic baby boomers need new hips and knees a recent study estimates that without antibiotics one out of would die so no heart operations no prostate biopsies strep throat in the cleanest hospitals almost one woman out of every one hundred pneumonia took three children out of every ten if you knew that any injury could kill you would you let your kid slide into home plate after all the first person to receive penicillin a british policeman named albert alexander who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye was infected by doing something very simple he walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn that british project i mentioned which estimates that the worldwide toll right now is seven hundred thousand deaths a year also predicts that if we can 't get this under control by two thousand and fifty not long the worldwide toll will be ten million deaths a how did we get to this point the difficult answer is we did it to ourselves resistance is an inevitable biological process but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it we did this by squandering 1950s in much of the developing world most antibiotics still are fifty percent of the antibiotics given in hospitals are unnecessary forty five percent of the prescriptions written in doctor 's offices are for conditions that antibiotics cannot help and that 's just in healthcare but to fatten them up possibly eighty percent of the antibiotics sold every year go creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm and fruit growing relies on and because bacteria can pass their dna to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport once we have encouraged that resistance into existence there is no knowing where it will spread it was predicted he was given the nobel prize in in recognition and in an interview shortly after this is what he said the thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a i hope this evil can be averted can we avert it there are companies working on novel antibiotics things the superbugs have never seen before and we need to lure other companies into making antibiotics again evolution always wins bacteria birth a new generation every twenty minutes it takes pharmaceutical chemistry ten years to derive a new every time we use an antibiotic we give the bacteria there has never yet been a drug they could not defeat this is asymmetric warfare but we could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically we could require we could build surveillance systems to tell us where resistance is emerging next unless we help but as a society we 've done that in the past people used to toss litter litter into the streets used to not wear seatbelts used to smoke we don 't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer because we decided those things were expensive i know that the scale of antibiotic resistance seems overwhelming but if you 've ever bought a fluorescent lightbulb because you were concerned about climate change or read the label on a box of crackers because you think about the deforestation from palm oil you already know what it feels like to take a tiny step we could forgo giving an antibiotic if we 're not sure it 's the right one we could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid 's ear infection we could we could promise each other never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine and if we did those things we could slow down the arrival of the post antibiotic world but we have to do it soon penicillin began the antibiotic era in one thousand nine hundred and forty three in just seventy years we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster we won 't get seventy years to find our way back out again thank you very much"
