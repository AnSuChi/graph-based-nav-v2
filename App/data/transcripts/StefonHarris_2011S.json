  "transcript": "i didn 't realize there was going to be a little music before so i think i 'm going to start with what i just heard two okay the there okay more the okay the okay the the the first of all let 's welcome mr jamire williams on the drums christian sands on the piano and one of the things that is really sacred about it is that you have no opportunity to think about the future or the past you really are alive right here in this there are so many decisions being made when you walk on the bandstand we had no idea what key we were going to play in in the middle we sort of from the perspective of a jazz musician it 's easier to talk about someone else 's mistake the only mistake lies in that i 'm not able to perceive what it is that someone else did every mistake so it 's hard to even describe what a funny note would be so for example if i played a color like we were playing on a palette that if christian played a note like play an f see these are all right inside of the color palette if you played an if you played an f # though to most people 's ears they would perceive that as a mistake so i 'm going to show you we 're going to play just for a second and we 're going to play on this palette and at some point christian will introduce this note and we won 't react to it he 'll introduce it for a second and then i 'll stop i 'll talk for a second we 'll see what happens when we play with this palette the only way that i would say it was a mistake is in that we didn 't react to it so it 's unpredictable we 'll paint this palette again or not all okay he played this note i ended up creating a melody out of it the texture changed in the drums this time it got a little bit more rhythmic a little bit more intense in response to how i responded to it so there is no mistake the only mistake is if i 'm not aware if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his jazz this bandstand is absolutely amazing it 's a very purifying experience well we 're jazz musicians so stereotypically we don 't have a great relationship to finance i just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it and the other dynamic of it is is that we don 't micromanage in jazz you have some people who do but what that does is it actually limits the artistic possibilities if i come up and i dictate to the band that i want to play like this and i want the music to go this way and i just jump right in ready just play some 's kind of chaotic because i 'm bullying my ideas i 'm telling them you come with me over this way if i really want the music to go there the best way for me to do it is to listen this is a science of listening it has so if i want the music to get to a certain level of intensity the first step for me is to be patient to listen to what 's going on and pull from something that 's going on around me when you do that you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more and gradually it builds watch accepting one another and allowing creativity to flow"
