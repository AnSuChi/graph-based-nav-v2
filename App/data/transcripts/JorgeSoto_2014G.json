  "transcript": "almost a year ago my aunt started suffering back pains she went to see the doctor and they told her it was a normal injury for someone who had been playing tennis for almost thirty years but after a while she wasn 't feeling better again and two weeks and she had been playing sports for almost half her life perhaps that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed my story might familiar to most of you one out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer and one out of four will die because of it but that process of going back and forth different doctors describing symptoms discarding diseases over and over was stressful and frustrating we have but we still have 20th century procedures and processes for diagnosis if any most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something is the majority of people still even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it and that is why my team and i have decided to begin this journey this journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and smarter and more accessible than ever before the context of course is that we 're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates it is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster just as and that is allowing multidisciplinary teams like ours to try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches we are a team of scientists we believe that we have found a reliable we do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called micrornas protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating dna relevant parts of its genetic code present in the dna are copied into the messenger rna and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins but the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are micrornas unlike dna which is mainly fixed micrornas can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time is a disease of altered gene expression it is the uncontrolled regulation of genes but at the microrna level there are patterns several scientific studies have shown that abnormal reflecting the progression of the disease however the problem with micrornas is that we cannot use existing dna based technology to detect them in a reliable way because they are very short sequences of nucleotides much smaller imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test a and puts it in a standard 96 well plate like this one each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign that is looking for a specific microrna it will shine with green color to run the reaction you put the plate inside a device like this one and then you can put your smartphone on top of it if we can a camera here so you can see my screen good enough for our purpose and when the reaction is over it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation this entire process lasts around sixty and then when this entire process is over this is what happens this chart is showing the specific micrornas present in this sample and how they reacted over time then if we take this specific pattern of microrna this person 's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microrna patterns with a specific presence of a disease this is how pancreatic cancer looks like this inside is a real sample where we just detected pancreatic cancer important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information if isolated and data science to try to tackle one of humanity 's toughest challenges this entire solution costs at least fifty times less and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more so we 're making the design of the device open source let me say very clearly that we are at the so far we have been able to successfully identify the microrna pattern and currently we 're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the german cancer research center with two hundred women for breast cancer test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done since we 're looking for the microrna patterns in your blood at any given time you don 't need to know which cancer you 're looking for you don 't need to have any symptoms you only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear we cannot lose the war against cancer it not only costs us billions of dollars but it also costs us the people we love today my aunt i want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages and i 'm certain it will give us the chance of detecting it early thank you very much"
