  "transcript": "but and why francis and i found it and then i hope maybe i have at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now in back of me is a picture me when i was seventeen i was at the university of chicago in my third year and i was in my third year because the university of chicago let you in after two years of high school so you it was fun to get away from high school because i was very small and i was no good in sports or anything like that but i should say that my background my father but after one year of college he became an atheist and a democrat and and but she didn 't take religion too seriously and by the age of eleven i was no longer going to sunday mass and going on birdwatching walks with my father so early on i heard of charles darwin i guess you know he was you know if i was bright enough maybe getting a ph d from cornell in ornithology then in the chicago paper there was a review of a book called what is life by the great physicist schrodinger and that of course had been a question i wanted to know you know darwin explained life after it got started but what was the essence of life and schrodinger said the essence was information present in our chromosomes and it had to be present on a molecule i 'd never really thought of molecules before you know chromosomes but this was a molecule and and there was the big question of how did you copy the information so that was the book and so from that moment on i wanted to so and so i applied to caltech and they turned me down so i went to indiana which was actually as good as caltech in genetics and besides they had a really good basketball team so i had a really quite happy life at indiana and it was at indiana so i first went to copenhagen because i thought well maybe i could become a biochemist it wasn 't going anywhere toward you know saying what the gene was it was just nuclear science and and and and he talked about dna and this was maurice wilkins was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked dna because dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes most people believed it was proteins but and he showed this x ray photograph sort of crystalline so i and i ended up in cambridge england so i went to cambridge because it was really the best place in the world then for so the best place for x ray crystallography was at the cavendish laboratory at and there i met francis crick i went there without knowing him he was thirty five i was twenty three and within had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of dna not solve it like you know but build a model an electro model using some coordinates of you know length all that sort of stuff from x ray photographs but just ask what the molecule how should it fold up and the reason for doing so sir lawrence bragg who was the cavendish professor this is a photograph he certainly wasn 't smiling when i got there because he was somewhat humiliated by pauling getting the alpha helix and the cambridge people failing because they and so we tried to build a model and he knew three stranded model the people from london came up wilkins possible collaborator rosalind franklin came up and sort of laughed at our model they said it was lousy and it was we were incompetent and so we didn 't build any models and francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically i did nothing if dna is that important linus will know it he 'll build a model and then we 're going to be scooped and in fact he 'd written the people in london could he see their x ray photograph and they had the wisdom to say no so he didn 't have it actually linus didn 't look at about and boy i was scared and he proposed if the peak ph that cells have is around seven those hydrogen bonds couldn 't exist we rushed over to the chemistry department and said could pauling be right and alex hust said no so we were happy and you know we were still in the game we were frightened that somebody at caltech would tell linus that he was wrong and so bragg said build models and a month after we got the pauling manuscript i should say i took the manuscript to london and showed the people well i said linus was wrong and that we 're still in the game and that they should immediately start building models but wilkins said no rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left he would start building models and in one sense she was a chemist but really she would have been trained and i think part of the reason she didn 't want to build models was she wasn 't and you know started building models and i 'd learned a little chemistry but not enough well we got the answer on the 28th february ' fifty three and it was because of a rule which to me is a very good rule never be the brightest person in chemists in the room i went in and showed them a pairing i 'd done and so the next day you know after i thought well he might be right so i changed the locations then we found the base pairing and francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions and so it was a pretty you know it all happened in about two hours if you just put a next to t and g next to c you have a you might as well believe it because you didn 't have any other scheme but that 's not the way most scientists think most scientists are really rather dull they said we won 't think about it until we know it 's right but so think about it so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio how do you what does this genetic information do it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an rna molecule and then how do you go from rna to protein for about three years we just i tried to solve the structure of rna it didn 't yield i was decidedly unhappy a girl didn 't marry me it was really you know sort of a shitty time so there 's a picture of francis and i before i met the girl so i 'm still looking happy laughter but there is what we did when we didn 't know where to go forward we formed a club feynman was a member and teller and friends of gamow but that 's the only no we were only photographed twice and on both get happy until one thousand nine hundred and sixty that there are three forms of rna and we knew basically dna provides the information at that time i should go back when we i gave my first talk at cold spring harbor the physicist leo szilard he looked at me and said are you going to patent this and but he he knew patent law and that we couldn 't patent it because you couldn 't no use for it and so dna didn 't become a useful molecule and the lawyers didn 't enter into the equation until boyer and cohen at least they patented something which you know could do useful things and boom we 've you know had a biotech industry answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood which is how do you nature nurture and so i 'll go on time but this is michael wigler a very very clever mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which will let us look at sample dna and eventually a million spots along it there 's a chip there a conventional one then there 's one made by a photolithography by a company in madison called nimblegen which is and and what you can do is sort of compare dna of normal segs versus cancer and you can see so we think that this will eventually lead to what we call dna biopsies before you get treated for cancer you should really look at this technique and get a feeling of the face of the enemy it 's not a it 's only a partial look but it 's a no government money and so you know you aren 't treated if it 's not dangerous but wigler besides looking at cancer cells looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation which is all of us have about ten places in our genome where we 've lost a gene or gained another one so we but if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene maybe and the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it looking at an individual is about three thousand dollars and the parent of a child with asperger 's disease the high intelligence autism had sent his thing to a conventional company they didn 't do it couldn 't do it by conventional genetics but just scanning it we began to find genes for autism and you can see here there are a lot of them so we haven 't yet looked at the parents but the parents probably don 't have that loss or they wouldn 't be parents now so our autism study is just beginning we got three million dollars i think it will cost at least ten to twenty before you 'd be in a position to help parents who 've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we spot the difference so this same technique should probably look at and we thought we 'd probably have to look at several hundred before we got the picture but as you can see there 's seven out of twenty had a change which was very high and yet in the controls there were three so what 's the meaning of the controls were they crazy also and we didn 't know and whether this is one that predisposes and then there 's only a of the population that 's capable of being schizophrenic now we don 't have to give you a hypothesis the best guess is that if you 're left handed you 're prone to schizophrenia thirty percent of schizophrenic people are left handed and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics which means sixty percent of the people are genetically left handed but only half of it showed i don 't have the time to say now some people who think they you know children won 't be at risk of schizophrenia you might"
