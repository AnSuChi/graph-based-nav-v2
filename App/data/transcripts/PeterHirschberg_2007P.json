  "transcript": "the computer and television both recently turned sixty and today i 'd like to talk about their relationship it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces and it 's not just what these are doing to each other but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter to get a sense of this and it 's been a theme we 've talked about and then tell me why let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television girl one well i think it 's important but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs peter hirshberg which is more fun internet or tv girls internet girl two i think we the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff ph there 's been an uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about thirty we go through periods let me give you an example of this the and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce qube the first interactive cable tv system and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home convergence great things are happening everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures citicorp penney by the way this is about when i enter the picture i 'm and i had a happy brush with convergence until kind of warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing that 's when i leave graduate school and where the remaining jobs are almost to the sea to go to work for apple computer which was real money back in the ' 70s but they were onto something and they got better at it by the year two thousand the process was perfected they merged with aol managed to shed showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet now i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities or the media community is driven so and the answer is pretty clearly it 's people in religion and and in politics and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we 're going to change the world it doesn 't work out too well and so but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems but things got really interesting just a couple of years later one thousand nine hundred and forty nine with whirlwind built at jay forrester was building this for the navy but you can 't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers and the computer begins to express itself computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research why don 't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy this rocket goes up one hundred and thirty five miles into the sky i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and the velocity dropped off to a minimum we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that you know so much was worked out the first real time interaction the video display but unfortunately it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever and knowing a good thing when it sees it the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a bomb in the first place talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman here 's their marketing video narrator in high speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage the semi automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses built to become the nerve center of a defense network is able to perform all the complex mathematical it is provided with its own powerhouse and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer ph you know that one computer you can either say this is going to be wonderful it will make you feel better and enliven you or there 's one other marketing proposition if you don 't use our product you 'll die this is a really good example of that this had the first pointing device it was distributed so it worked out distributed computing and modems so all these things could talk to each other about twenty percent of all the nation if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you 'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in there but like let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core two extreme which is a four core processor that that intel 's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow and then the ninety two nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they 're on to something clearly they 're not so dec kind of reduces all this and makes the and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and and passion is worked out actually model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i 've been reading all week rca had david sarnoff who basically commercialized radio said this every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues as the computer industry develops interactively producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea and they fake it we get some of the magic into it boys and girls then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set ok let 's get right to the first story about dusty man come on into the secret lab dawn of interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you 're saying pete i could use any ordinary open source crayon why do i have to buy theirs i assure you that 's not the case this proprietary principle of vendor it led to lawsuits but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host went on to become the host of twenty one it turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from professor marshall mcluhan it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications here he is talking from the if the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do now then this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the it is very true that his understanding global village is a world in which you don 't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business and it but it does mean huge involvement in and as small as a we 're now right into the 1960s it 's the era of big business and data centers for computing but all that was about to change you know the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations it 's not just a joke about messianism it 's actually what we do but for this part of the story i 'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john markoff john markoff do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs sex rock ' n ' roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing everything it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing at stanford university between one thousand nine hundred and sixty and in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks a group of changed the world but while he was beginning to do his work all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula there was lsd leaking out of kesey 's veterans ' hospital experiments and other areas around the campus and there was music literally in the streets the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors people were leaving to go back to the land there was the vietnam war there was black liberation there was women 's liberation this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build i think these ideas are difficult to understand because when you 're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like science fiction universe it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title of the book is what the dormouse said how the ' 60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry feed your head here 's the architecture machine group the predecessor of the media lab we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool a few years later we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it here 's the apple marketing video video the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific but he 's just declared war mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education market and a personal matter between the computer and the file system that 's fine but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network but a couple of years later i helped bill gates he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain but we also missed an awful lot new york subway system and ancient and modern wonders of the man made world all yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of once it was only a dream of technoids and a few let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell though some were incredulous man one the phone company narrator stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising david windows for radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work narrator in one thousand nine hundred and thirty nine the radio corporation of america never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand narrator eventually the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the and the re regulation of the cable television industry escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas the world and all its culture reduced to bits the lingua franca of all media and the forces of convergence finally channels for the gourmet and we 'll see channels for the pet lover voice two next on the gourmet pet channel decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer narrator the battle open systems social networks it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media thomas edison had the same problem he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it and kind of only one of his ideas we come into the era of the but when we emerge from this and what we call web two point zero things actually are quite different and i think it 's the reason that tv 's so challenged if internet one was about pages now it 's about people audience it 's a person who 's participating it 's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now mm because it gave the audience a role something to do ph we see something like sixty seven thousand blog posts an hour come in that 's about two thousand seven hundred fresh connective links and it 's no wonder that as odd things happen you know it reminds me of that old saw in hollywood that a but it 's not a joke this is a real headline operators of sites like could benefit from labor which is about to sponsor the online video awards but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television not appearing to gloat to show you how schizophrenic this all is here 's the head of myspace or fox interactive a news corp i think there 's an opportunity as the strike continues there 's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like myspace tv ph oh but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch man yes well first you know i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group obviously we hope that the strike is is that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible ph one of the great things that 's going on here here is a clip from a video and it 's now an international series narrator the following takes place between the minutes of two fifteen to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over voice two you mean we 'll have to live here together voices two three and four with her voice two aniboom is an interesting example of where this is headed traditional tv animation costs say between eighty thousand and ten thousand dollars a minute they 're producing things for between and they 're offering their creators thirty percent of the back end in a much more entrepreneurial manner so it 's a different model what the entertainment business is struggling with the world of brands is figuring out for example nike now understands that nike plus it 's a network to hook its we don 't have to go to them which means television advertising is down fifty seven percent for nike or as nike 's head of marketing says we 're not in the business of keeping media companies alive we 're in the business of connecting with consumers and media companies realize the audience is important also here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones powered one hundred percent by the user experience on the home page who just wrote the and i think that today traditional hollywood and the writers let 's throw it back to him they think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium and it is highly observable real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium and it is ignored ph i think it 's a great time of enthrallment there 's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth and part of social communications and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity"
