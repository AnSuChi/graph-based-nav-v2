  "transcript": "and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better i had a vision of ten girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this i couldn 't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly and i just waited for the time that i could go off and read my books first time that i took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of and then the second time i tried it the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be and so i put my books away back in their suitcase and i put them under my bed but i did forsake them and i didn 't open that suitcase again until i was back home with my family at the end of the i tell you this story about summer camp i could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that i got the message but for years i denied and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends now this is what many introverts do and it 's our loss for sure but it is also also our colleagues ' loss and our communities ' loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world 's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best so even if you 're an extrovert yourself i 'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we 're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is it 's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and their most capable when they 're in quieter more low key environments so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here 's where the bias comes in and also which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place we sat in rows and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces now most of us work in open plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsize risks which is something we might all favor nowadays because when they are managing proactive whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they 're putting their own stamp on things and other people 's ideas gandhi and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power because they were driven to do what they thought was right now including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum and some people fall smack we need a much better balance we need more of a yin and yang between these two types because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them better known as dr seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona steve wozniak invented the first apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle in hewlett packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and case in point is steve wozniak famously coming together with steve jobs to start apple computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it 's only recently that we 've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world 's major religions you will find seekers where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you 're attracted dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there 's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas i mean zero so but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well managed environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history western societies and in particular the u s have always favored the man of action over the of contemplation where we still at that point valued people the grandest thing in the world ralph waldo emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority and we entered a new culture that historians call the and instead of working alongside people they 've known all their they feature as their role models really great salesmen and i 'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us so now i 'd like to share with you what 's in my suitcase today guess what books i have a suitcase full of books here 's margaret atwood cat 's eye and here 's the guide for the perplexed by maimonides but these are not exactly my books i brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather 's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when i was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with i mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the sixty two years that he was a rabbi he would takes the fruits of each week 's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak underneath this ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for but when he died at the age of and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather 's example in my own way so i just published a book because but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that 's a lot harder for me because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now so i prepared for moments like these as best i could i spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance i could get and i call this my year of speaking dangerously but i 'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change i mean we are and so i am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and i want to be clear about what i 'm saying because i deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great it 's great for introverts and so extroverts but occasionally so i wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage thank you very much"
