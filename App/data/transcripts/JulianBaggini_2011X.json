  "transcript": "but the idea i 'm not quite sure at least we have to understand a bit better what that means now certainly i think there are lots of things in our culture around us which sort of reinforce the idea that for each one of us we have a kind of a core an essence there is something about what it means to be you which defines you and it 's kind of there are also more scientific versions of this myers briggs tests for example i don 't know if you 've done those a lot of companies use these for and this is supposed to reveal something about your your core personality and of course the popular fascination with this is enormous in magazines like this you 'll see in the bottom left corner they 'll advertise in virtually every issue some kind of personality thing and if you pick up one of those magazines it 's hard to resist isn 't it doing the test to find what is your learning style what is your are you this kind of person or that so i think that we have a idea and that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves something that 's the same throughout life well that 's the challenge actually has a very very long and distinguished history here 's the common sense idea now in your life what happens is that you of course accumulate different maybe for something that we don 't want to talk about at eleven o 'clock either way they have beliefs about messiahs we have knowledge we have sensations and experiences as well it 's not just intellectual things i think of what a person but the suggestion and i can show you what 's wrong with one click which is there isn 't actually a but and they 're kind of all integrated they 're overlapped they 're connected in various different ways they 're connecting partly and perhaps even mainly because they all belong to one body and one brain but there 's also a narrative a story we tell about ourselves the experiences we have when we remember past things we do things because of other things so what we desire is partly a result of what we believe and what we remember is also informing us what we know and so really there are all these things like beliefs desires sensations experiences and that just is you in some ways it 's a massive one it now those parts are also physical parts of course brains bodies and now this idea but is kind of a collection of experiences in a way it 's common sense because i just invite you to think about by comparison now my science isn 't very good we might say something like water has two parts hydrogen and one parts oxygen right i hope no one in this room thinks that what that means is there is a thing called water and attached to it are hydrogen and oxygen atoms and that 's what water is of course we don 't we understand very easily very straightforwardly that water is nothing more than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged why but interestingly it 's also a view increasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience paul broks he 's a clinical neuropsychologist but it 's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain where things do all come together but it 's because of the way that they relate that we get this sense of self does that mean that really the there is no real you well a lot of people actually do use this talk of illusion and so forth these are three psychologists thomas metzinger bruce hood susan blackmore a lot of these people do talk the language of illusion the self is an illusion it 's a fiction because there is nothing to the watch other than a collection of its parts in some ways just this very very complex now there 's nothing permanent about this for one thing it 's always changing the waters are always carving channels with changes and tides and the weather some things dry up new things are created of course the water that flows through the waterfall is different every single instance but it doesn 't mean that the iguazu falls are an illusion it doesn 't mean it 's not real now that i think is a model for understanding ourselves and i think it 's a in a sense you 're kind of trapped but if you think of yourself as being in a way not a thing as such but a kind of a process something i think that 's quite liberating because unlike the the waterfalls we actually have the capacity to channel the direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be that 's not true i 've heard some fantastic but i don 't the true self as it were then is not something that is just there for you to discover you probably feel embarrassed because you don 't recognize yourself your true self"
