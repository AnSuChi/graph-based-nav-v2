  "transcript": "so i decided to follow in the footsteps of the great american philosopher morgan spurlock and try something new for thirty days it turns out thirty days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit like watching the news from your life the first was instead of the months flying by the time was much more memorable i went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work have you ever wanted to write a novel tens of thousands of people try to write their own so i did by the way the secret is not to go to sleep until you 've written your words for the day now is my book the next great american novel no i wrote it in a month it 's awful i don 't have to say i 'm a computer scientist no no if i want to i can say i 'm a novelist so here 's one last thing i 'd like to mention i learned that when i made small when i gave up sugar for thirty days day thirty one looked like this so here 's my question to you what are you waiting for i guarantee you the next thirty days are going to pass whether you like it or not so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next thirty days"
