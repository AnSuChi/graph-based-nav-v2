  "transcript": "every time we make irrational demands exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal george w bush ask yourself who 's responsible adults what have kids done well anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the united states so as you can see evidenced by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking thank who 's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren 't exactly what the world needs maybe you 've had grand plans before but stopped that won 't benefit me for better or worse we kids aren 't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals because you know that if everything were free then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos on the other hand we kids still dream about perfection and that 's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality you have to dream about it first our audacity to imagine imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state yoohoo washington has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of brokenhearted snakes and bacon boys who you can see has meat vision our inherent wisdom doesn 't have to be insider 's knowledge kids already do a lot of learning from adults we have a lot to share i think that adults should start learning from kids now telling students do this do that the students should teach their teachers the reality unfortunately is a little different and it has a lot to do with trust or a lack of it now if you don 't trust someone you place restrictions on them right if i doubt my older sister 's ability to pay back the ten percent interest i established on her last loan i 'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back true story by the way now adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards don 't do that don 't do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become oppressive when they 're fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they didn 't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read to us about aristotle and pioneer lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ fighters totally rules i wrote over three hundred short stories on that little instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you 're older my parents were really supportive many publishers were not quite so encouraging one large children 's publisher ironically said that they didn 't work with children children 's publisher not working with children one publisher action publishing was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what i had to say they published my first book flying fingers you see it here and from there on it 's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools keynoting to thousands of educators and finally today speaking to you i appreciate your attention because to show that you truly care you listen but there 's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults kids grow up and become adults just like you the goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult but rather better adults than you have been which may be a little challenging the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones it 's the reason we 're not in the dark ages anymore no matter your position or place in life it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away adults and fellow tedsters you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us no just kidding no really we are going to be the next generation the ones who will bring this world forward and in case you don 't think that this really has meaning for you remember that cloning is possible and that involves going through childhood the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas kids need opportunities to lead and succeed are you ready to make the match because the world 's problems shouldn 't be the human family 's heirloom thank you"
