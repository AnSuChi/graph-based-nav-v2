  "transcript": "what i 'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of india 's maybe the world 's longest running soap opera it 's got everything that you 'd want a normal soap opera to want it 's got love and that 's what i 'm going to talk about how a small change leads to a like that cricket wasn 't always this and there was this game in march one thousand nine that started on the third of march and ended on the 14th of march and it only ended because the english cricketers had to go from durban to cape town which is a two hour train journey to catch the ship that left on the 17th because the next ship wasn 't around for a long time and one of the english batsmen said you know what another half an hour and we would have won so you don 't play on and one day it rained so they all sat around making friends with each other but there is a reason why india fell in love with cricket because we had about the same pace of life the mahabharata was like that as well wasn 't it you fought by day and then you worked out your strategy and you came and fought the next day and you went back home again the only difference between the mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket everybody was alive to come back and fight the next but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the british rulers but you could play it in the dump with some rocks over there you could play it in a little alley you or you could play many games in one small patch of land even if you didn 't know which game you were actually in but slowly and then and we won this world cup in one thousand nine hundred and eighty three there was more 50 over cricket than anywhere and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian and there are only two vehicles in india one real one scripted and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me ravi dhariwal from pepsi decided he 's going to take it all over the world and pepsi was this big revolution and so cricket started becoming big cricket started bringing riches in television started covering cricket for a long time television said we won 't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it then they said ok the next rights are sold for fifty five million dollars the next rights are sold for six hundred and twelve million dollars thank god for them and so india had to go and play the t20 world cup you see and then this moment that will remain enshrined forever for everybody take a look suddenly india discovered this power of 20 overs cricket the accident of course there was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast if and so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do and thankfully for all of us the english are very good at inventing things and then the gracious people that they are they let the world become very good at it and so england invented t20 cricket and allowed india to hijack it it was not like reengineering that we do in medicine new thing for us we had only ever supported our country the only two areas in which india was very proud about now suddenly we had to support america is a home of leagues it was never promoted you had that an opening ceremony to match every other this was an india that was buying corvettes this was an india that was buying jaguar this was an india that was adding more mobile phones per month than new zealand 's population twice over but everyone claimed not to and they 've started promoting them with huge money behind it i mean the ipl had two point three billion dollars before a ball was bowled but what they were very good at doing was making it very localized just to give you an example of how they did it not manchester united style promotion but very mumbai style promotion take a look a lot of people said maybe they dance better than they play but that 's all right and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers now all of the sudden if you were to bowl a shot if mumbai were to bowl a shot for example they needn 't go to kalbadevi or shivaji park or somewhere to source them they could go to trinidad this was the new india wasn 't it this was the new world where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price and all of a sudden indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world so the mumbai indians flew in dwayne bravo from trinidad and tobago overnight and when he had to go back to represent the west indies they asked him it 's about when do you have to reach there and so he said i 've got to reach on date x and they said fine you play to date x minus one went from the stadium to hyderabad airport sat in a private corporate jet first refueling in portugal second refueling in brazil he was in west indies in time never would india have thought on this scale before and i will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to kingston jamaica to play a game and i just thought to myself wow we 've arrived somewhere in the world you know we have arrived somewhere we are thinking big but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things people started going to the cricket to watch preity zinta and so it started resembling the indian movies more and more and of course 's team as you will see on the clip that follows if you did well you got a hug from preity zinta so that was the ultimate reason to do well take a look everyone 's watching preity zinta and then of course there was shah rukh playing the kolkata crowd we but for kolkata but take a look at this indian film star hugging a pakistani cricketer because they 'd won in kolkata can you imagine and do you know what the pakistani cricketer said i wish i was playing for preity zinta 's team but i thought i 'd take this opportunity there 's a few people from pakistan in here i 'm so happy that you 're here because i think we can show that we can both be together and be friends right we can play cricket together we can be friends so thank you very much for coming all of you from pakistan there was criticism players are being bought and sold are they grain are they cattle and so the auction that followed literally had people saying bang so many million dollars for a game which earned its players fifty rupees a day so two hundred and fifty rupees for a test match but if you finish in four days you only got two hundred the best indian players who played every test match every one of the internationals the top of the line players standard contracts are two hundred and twenty thousand dollars in a whole year now they were getting five hundred thousand for six days ' work then andrew flintoff came by from england he got one and a half million dollars and he went back and said for four weeks i 'm earning more than frank lampard and steven gerrard and i 'm earning more than the footballers wow and where was he earning it from from a little club in india could you have imagined that day would come one and a half million dollars for six weeks ' work that 's not bad is it and it became a huge brand and we had to start the tournament because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks our population which for a for a long time we thought was a problem suddenly became our biggest asset more people watching the huge consuming class everybody came to watch the cricket we but in india every other sport pushes cricket to become big which is a bit of a tragedy of our times now this last minute before i go there 's a couple of side effects of all this for a long time india was this country of delhi belly people heard delhi belly stories before they came and all of a sudden india was this land of opportunity we love to play in india we said the dollar 's quite powerful actually can you imagine you 've got the dollar on view and there 's no delhi belly in there anymore there 's no filth there 's no beggars all the snake charmers have vanished everybody 's gone this tells you how the capitalist world rules finally an english game that india usurped a little bit hopefully it 'll make everyone richer hopefully it 'll make the game bigger and hopefully it 'll give cricket commentators more time in the business thank you very much"
