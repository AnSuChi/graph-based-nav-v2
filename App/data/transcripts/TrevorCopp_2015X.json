  "transcript": "dancing with the stars first hit the airwaves that is not what it looked like laughter jeff and i were full time ballroom dance instructors when the big tv ballroom revival hit and was incredible i mean one day we would say foxtrot and people were like foxes trotting and all of the ballroom dance that we had always done on why salsa worked differently than the competitive rumba and why tango traveled unlike the waltz all of that just hit the public consciousness and it changed everything but running parallel to this excitement the excitement that suddenly somehow we were cool laughter there was also this reservation why this and why now we even came up with a system for switching lead and follow while we were dancing as a way of taking turns and playing fair it wasn 't until we used that system as part of a performance in a small festival that we got an important tap on the shoulder lisa o 'connell a dramaturge and director of a center pulled us aside after the show and said do you have any idea how political that was so that began an eight year collaboration to create a play which not only further developed our system for switching but also explored the impact of being locked into a single role and what 's worse being defined by that single role it 's a way of thinking of being so street salsa championship tango it 's all the same he leads she so this was gender training you weren 't just learning to dance you were learning to man and to woman so we asked ourselves if you strip it all down what is at the core of partner dancing jf well the physics of movement doesn 't really give a crap about your gender laughter so if we were to update the existing form we would need to make it more representative when you watch ballroom don 't just watch what 's there watch what 's not the couple is always only a man and a woman together only ever so same sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear in most mainstream international ballroom competitions same sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor and in many cases the rules prohibit them completely professional latin dancer and then look for an actual latino person you 'll be there for days what you will get is page after page of white straight russian couples spray tanned to the point of mahogany there are no black people there are no asians no mixed race she can 't be taller he can 't be shorter she can 't be bolder he can 't be gentler would never stand for this he dictates she reacts no relationship gay straight or anything that we would regard as remotely healthy or functional looks like that and yet somehow you put it on prime time you slap some makeup on it throw the glitter on put it out there as movement not as text tune in and clap we are applauding our own absence too many people have disappeared from partner dancing interesting appealing even even avid followers of the same sex ballroom circuit can aesthetically speaking if alida and i take the classic closed ballroom hold this is considered beautiful but why not this see the standard image that the leader must be larger and masculine and the follower smaller and feminine this is a stumbling point tc so we wanted to look at this from a totally different angle further what if a couple could lead and follow each other and then switch and then switch back what it could be like a conversation taking turns listening and speaking just like we do in life what if we could dance like that we call it liquid lead dancing jf in salsa there 's a key transitional we use it as punctuation to break up the improvisation it can be a little tricky to spot if you 're not used to looking for it so here it is one more time for the cheap seats nice and slow if we apply liquid lead thinking to this transitional step the cross body lead becomes a point where the lead and the follow can switch the person following can elect to take over the lead or the person leading can choose to surrender it essentially making it a lead here 's how that looks in slow motion and here 's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance this is only one example of how this applies but once the blinkers come off anything can happen the waltz is a turning dance this means that for the and because of the follower 's position no one can see where they 're going so and then imagine that coming right at you there are actually a lot of accidents out there that happen as a result of this blind even if one person led the whole dance but allowed this switch to happen it because physics doesn 't give a damn about your gender jf now and it never fails to engage but why the secret lies in what made lisa see our initial demonstration as political it wasn 't just that we were switching lead and follow regardless of which role we were playing we were still us and that 's where the true freedom lies not just the freedom to switch roles but the freedom from being defined by whichever role you 're playing forget what a lead is supposed to look like or a follow be a masculine follow or a feminine lead but on the floor it gives us the perfect opportunity to update an old paradigm and make it more representative of our era and our current way of being tc jeff and i dance partner dancing all the time with women and men and we love it but we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form that can produce silence and produce invisibility we invented liquid lead as a way of stripping out all the ideas that don 't belong to us and taking partner dancing back to what it really always was the fine art of taking care of each other the the the the"
