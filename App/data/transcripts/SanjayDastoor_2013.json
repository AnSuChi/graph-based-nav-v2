  "transcript": "today i 'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle that you can carry with you anywhere that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in fifteen minutes and you can run it for one thousand kilometers but when i say the word electric vehicle but if you come about it from a different perspective you can create some more interesting so we built something i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here so this is the motor and this battery this battery right here has about six miles of range or ten kilometers which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u s but the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store these are from remote control airplanes and the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently you can really change things so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this pay attention to not only how fun this thing is but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco show you what this thing can do it go in reverse if you like also have braking it 's incredible just how light this thing is i mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go so i 'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles this uses twenty times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use so next time you think about a vehicle i hope like us you 're thinking about something new"
