  "transcript": "i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up in accra to figure out how did this thing work i read about how the is constantly shuffling data back and forth between the memory the ram and i thought to myself this cpu really has to work like crazy just to keep all this data moving through the system but nobody was really worried about this they were said to be a million times faster than neurons people were this is a quote actually from alan turing in thirty years it will be as easy to ask a computer a question as to ask a person thousand and seven it 's still not true what people didn 't realize and i 'm just beginning to realize right now is that we pay a huge price for the speed let 's take a look at some numbers this they can basically process ten quadrillion bits of information per second that 's ten to the sixteenth so that would be really if you could add that to the production capacity in tanzania it would really boost the economy you get one thousand two hundred households in the u s that 's how much power this computer uses this is a picture of and he claims that this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned so that 's true love right there now how much computation does the brain do i estimate ten to the sixteen bits per second which is actually about very similar to what blue so that 's the question the question is how much they are doing a similar amount of processing similar amount of data the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use and it 's actually as much as your laptop computer it 's just ten watts so what we are doing right now with computers with the energy consumed by one thousand two hundred houses the brain is doing with the energy consumed by so the question is how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency and let me just summarize so the bottom line the brain processes information using one hundred thousand times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have how is the brain able to do this so this clip is from the pbs series the secret life of the brain it shows you these cells that they send little pulses of electricity and where they contact each other those little pulses of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other sending about and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons there 's no bottleneck here it 's really a network if you just look at these two pictures these kind of words pop into your mind this is serial and it 's rigid it 's like cars on a freeway so i 'm not the first to figure this out is a quote from brian eno the problem with computers is that there is not enough africa in them brian actually said this and nobody was listening then but now people are beginning to listen because there 's a pressing technological problem that we face and take you through that a little bit this is it 's actually really this remarkable convergence between the devices that we use to compute and the devices that our brains use to compute the devices that computers use are what 's called a transistor and that current electrical current is carried by electrons just like in your house and so on and what there 's no current flowing through the device your computer uses they no longer behave like this in fact they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use and this is a little protein molecule i mean neurons have thousands of these because these ions have to line up and one at a time you get a kind of sporadic not steady they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity they can actually sneak through a few can sneak through at a time so what you have is that when the pore is open you get some current sometimes these are your ones but you 've got a few zeros thrown in and when it 's closed you have a zero but you have a few ones thrown in and the reason why that 's happening is that right now in two thousand and seven the technology that we are using a transistor is big enough that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously side by side in fact there 's about twelve electrons can all be flowing we will shrink transistors so much this is what intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip or your memory sticks that you have now can carry transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen and technology has really benefitted from that but what 's happening now is that in two thousand and fifteen the transistor is going to become so small and you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion will turn on and off so it sends it into the processor or the alu and then it puts the result back into memory that 's the red path that 's highlighted so you have all these pieces of data distributed throughout the network and then the way that you process that data to get a result is that you you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity just by it flowing flowing through the network so you set up these connections such that the input pattern just flows and generates the output pattern so if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered it doesn 't show up over here these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections so even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero and it doesn 't show up there 's redundancy in the network that can actually it makes the brain inherently robust otherwise you lose that data whereas in the brain you have a system which is to build a computer that works like the brain and i 'm going to show you a system that we designed to model the retina which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball we didn 't do this by actually writing code like you do in a computer in fact the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the internet they want to compress the information they just want to send the changes what 's new in the image and so on and eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve to send to the rest of the brain instead of doing this in software or doing those kinds of algorithms we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that 's called the retina and they figured out all the different cells and they figured out the network and we just took that network the neurons are represented by little and the connections among the neurons are represented and these transistors are behaving essentially just like ion channels behave in the brain it will give you the same kind of robust architecture that i described is actually what our artificial eye looks like the retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here and the chip i 'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at kareem zaghloul who 's the student who designed ok because it 's putting out different kinds of information it 's not as straightforward as a camera the retina chip extracts four different kinds of information it extracts and it extracts regions with white or light contrast which will show up on the video as and then it also extracts movement when kareem moves his head to see this blue activity there it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image that 's where it 's going from dark to light and you also see this yellow activity which represents regions where contrast is decreasing it 's going from light to dark and these four types of information your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it and nine hundred thousand of those fibers what you notice here is that these and then in the hair and so on and this is the same thing you see when people compress video to send they want to make it very sparse because that file is smaller and this is what the retina is doing and it 's doing it just with the circuitry how this network of neurons that are interacting in there which we 've captured on the chip so you know you can almost recognize kareem in that top part there the idea when you stand still you just see the the light and dark contrasts but when it 's moving back and forth the retina picks up these changes and that 's why you know when you 're sitting here and something happens in your background you merely move your eyes to it there are these cells that detect you move your attention to it so those are very important for catching somebody who 's trying to sneak up on you this is a steel drum here that has been modified and that 's what happens when you put africa in a piano and what i would like us to do is put africa in the computer and come up with a new kind of computer that will generate question for you kwabena do you put together in your mind the work you 're doing the future of africa this conference what connections can we make if any between them kwabena boahen yes like i said at the beginning i got my first computer when i was a teenager growing up and i had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it it was very brute force it was very hearing about was called and just you know buying into this hype about computers i was coming at it from a different perspective where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem and i think a lot of people in africa have this different and i think you 're going to be able to see use that infusion to come up with new things i think we can contribute we can dream like everybody else"
