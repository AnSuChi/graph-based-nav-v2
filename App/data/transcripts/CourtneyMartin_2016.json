  "transcript": "choosing a i 've been trying to understand what constitutes the but also because i 'm in desperate need of answers myself the majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off than they were this is true of rich and poor men and women after all america is deeply invested in this idea of economic transcendence earning more buying more being more we 've exported this dream all over the world so kids in brazil and china and even kenya inherit our insatiable expectation but when i read this historic poll for the first time it didn 't actually make me feel sad it felt like a provocation better off based on whose standards is better off finding a secure job that you can count on for the rest of your life ok so is better off just a number is it about earning as much as you possibly can median per capita income has been flat since about two thousand adjusted for inflation less of us are doing that nearly five million people lost their homes in the great recession and even more of us sobered up about the lengths we were willing to go or be tricked into going in many predatory cases to hold that deed toll the funeral bells for everything that made america great but are those the best measurements of a country 's greatness of a life well lived what i think makes america great is its spirit of reinvention the fourteen point eight percent of americans living in poverty need money plain and simple and all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation by employers and financial institutions nothing that follows is meant to suggest that the gap between rich and poor is anything but profoundly immoral part of what i 've learned in my research and reporting is that the art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable i 've come to believe that recession can be the father of consciousness how should we work how should we live whether we realize it or not seek answers to these questions with our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears my was a drunk in detroit who sometimes managed to hold down a factory job he had as now i 'm pregnant with my second child and i cannot even fathom what she must have gone through and if you 're trying to do the math there were six sets of twins became a traveling salesman and he lived boom and bust so my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors and pretending his parents weren 't home became a couldn 't write this in a novel right he was obsessed with providing a secure foundation for my brother and i so i ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle my parents made sure that i grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap and ironically and probably sometimes to their frustration it is their steadfast commitment to security that allows me to question its value or at least its value as we 've historically defined it in the 21st century we should work like our mothers that 's right we 've spent decades trying to fit women into a work world built for creating a patchwork of meaning and money with enough flexibility to do what they need to do for those that they love my mom called it just making it work today i hear life coaches call it a portfolio career whatever you call it more and more men are craving these now artist ann hamilton has said labor is a way of knowing labor is a way of knowing in other words what we work on if this is true and i think it is then women who have disproportionately cared for the little ones and the sick ones and the aging ones have disproportionately benefited from the most profound kind of knowing there is knowing the human condition this means the nine to five no longer works for anyone so we need to stop asking kids what do you want to be when you grow up and start asking them how do you want to be when you grow up so the more they understand their gifts and create crews of ideal the better off they will be we need portable health benefits we need policies that reflect that archaic idea about bringing home the bacon is long overdue we should live like our immigrant ancestors survival tactics child care always knew how to fill one more belly no matter how small the food available but they were told that success meant leaving the village behind and pursuing that iconic symbol of the american dream the white picket fence and even today we see a white picket fence and we think success but when you strip away the sentimentality what it really does is divides us many americans are rejecting the white picket fence and the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it fifty million of us for example live in intergenerational households but it turns out people actually like living this way two thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof say it 's improved their relationships some people are choosing to share homes not with family but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits of daily community and people over sixty five are especially prone to be looking for these alternative living arrangements they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude which is true of all of us when you think about it young and old alike for too long we 've pretended that happiness is a king in his castle it shows that the healthiest happiest and even safest in terms of both climate change now i 've experienced this firsthand it 's one point five acres of persimmon trees but they 're meant to be as green as possible so big shiny black solar cells on our roof mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds more than five bucks in a month the twenty five of us who live there are all different ages and political persuasions and professions and we live in homes that have everything a typical home would have industrial sized kitchen and eating area where we have common meals twice when i tell them i live like this often have one of two extreme reactions either they say why doesn 't everyone live like this or they say that sounds but also a commitment to what we call radical hospitality not the kind advertised by the four seasons but the kind that says that every single person is worthy of the biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this you share all the domestic labor the repairing the cooking the weeding but you also share the emotional labor rather than depending only on the idealized family unit to get all of your emotional needs met you have two dozen other teenagers in our community will often go to it 's what bell hooks called revolutionary parenting this humble acknowledgment that kids are healthier when they have a wider range of adults to emulate and count on it 's good common sense right in fact if you 're a failure or you think you 're a failure i 've got some good news for you you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored maybe you can 't afford your dream home but you throw legendary neighborhood parties if you 're a textbook success the implications of what i 'm saying could be more grim for you you might be a failure by standards you hold dear but that the world doesn i know that i am not a tribute to my you can 't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning there is no home big enough to erase the pain that she must have endured i am a tribute to her if i live a life as connected and courageous as possible but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple lose faith in the power of institutions to change even lose faith in ourselves or we can turn turns out the biggest danger the biggest danger is achieving a dream that you don 't actually believe in so don 't do that the people you give your best love and ingenuity and energy to aligns as closely as possible with what you believe that not something as mundane as making money is a tribute to your ancestors that is the beautiful struggle"
