  "transcript": "i became the world chess champion after beating anatoly karpov earlier that i played what is called simultaneous exhibition against i won all the games and then it was not considered much of a surprise that i could beat thirty two computers at the same time to me that was the golden age machines were weak and my hair was strong i was fighting for my life against just one computer in a match called by the cover of newsweek the brain 's last stand no pressure from mythology to science fiction human versus machine has been often portrayed as a matter of life and death john henry called the steel driving man in the 19th century african american folk legend was pitted in a race against hammer bashing a tunnel through mountain rock john henry 's legend is a part of a long historical narrative pitting humanity and this competitive rhetoric is standard now we are in a race against the machines jobs are being killed off people are being replaced as if they had vanished from the earth it 's enough to think there are very few instances of an arena where the human it was my blessing and my curse to literally become the proverbial man in the man versus machine competition that everybody is still talking about in the most famous i played two matches against the ibm supercomputer nobody remembers that i won the first match in philadelphia before losing the rematch the following year in new york but i guess that 's fair there is no day in history special calendar entry for all the people who failed to climb mt everest before sir edmund hillary and tenzing norgay made it to the top i was still the world champion i was mt everest and deep blue reached the summit something we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations deep blue was victorious but was it intelligent no no it wasn 't at least not in the way alan turing and other founders of computer science had hoped once hardware got fast enough and but even at the incredible speed two hundred million positions per second deep blue 's method provided soon but will they be intelligent i would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines when i first met deep blue and i had played one hundred world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions i knew what to expect from my opponents i was used to measure their moves and to gauge their emotional state by watching their body language something unsettling you might experience a similar feeling the first time you ride in a driverless car or the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work but when i sat at that first game i couldn 't be sure what is this thing capable of and i couldn 't help might it be invincible was my beloved game of chess over these were human doubts human fears and the only thing i knew for sure was that my opponent deep blue had no such worries at all i fought back but the writing was on the wall i eventually lost to the machine but i didn 't suffer the fate of john henry who won but died with his hammer in his hand it turned out that the world of chess still wanted to have a human chess champion and even today when a free chess app on the people are still playing chess even more than ever before but doomsaying has always been a popular pastime when it comes to technology i learned from my own experience is that we must face our fears if we want to get and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of our then i thought combining our strengths human intuition plus machine 's calculation human strategy human experience machine 's memory could it be the perfect game ever played my idea came to life in this human plus machine competition against we both failed to combine human and machine skills effectively a so called freestyle chess tournament produced a revelation a but the winners were not grandmasters the winners were a pair of amateur american chess players operating three ordinary pcs at the same time their skill of coaching their machines effectively counteracted counteracted the superior chess knowledge of their grandmaster opponents and much greater and i reached this formulation a weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior but more remarkably is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process this convinced me that we would need everybody that 's used online translation to get the gist knowing its far from perfect then we use our human experience to make sense out of that and then the machine learns from our corrections this model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis security analysis the machine crunches making it easier for analysis and decision making of the human party but you are not going to even with so we need a leap forward to add a few more twenty years after second match this sensational the brain 's last stand headline has become commonplace as machines move but unlike in the past when machines replaced manual labor now they are coming after people with college degrees and political influence and as someone who fought machines and lost i am here to tell you this is excellent excellent news eventually every profession will have to feel these pressures or else it will mean humanity has ceased to make progress we don 't get to choose when and where technological progress stops we have to speed up our technology excels at removing and so we must seek out ever more difficult ever more uncertain challenges machines have we have understanding machines have instructions should not worry because we will need the help intelligent machines to turn our it 's not because our machines are too intelligent or not intelligent enough if we fail it 's because we grew complacent and limited our ambitions our humanity is not defined by any skill like swinging a hammer or so let us dream big"
