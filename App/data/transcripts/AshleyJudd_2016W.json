  "transcript": "you can 't sue someone for calling them a cunt if i wish ashley judd would die a horrible death she is the absolute worst ashley judd you 're the reason women shouldn 't vote ' twisted ' is such a bad movie i don 't even want to rape it whatever you do don 't tell ashley judd she 'll die alone with a dried out vagina if i had to fuck an older woman oh my god i would fuck the the unforgivable shit i would do to her online misogyny and it is imperative that it ends i am a kentucky basketball fan so on a fine march day last year i was doing one of the things i do best i was cheering for my wildcats the daffodils were blooming but the referees were not blowing the whistle when i was telling them to funny they 're very friendly to me before the opening tip but they really ignore me during the game i tweeted routine for me to be treated in the ways i 've already described to you it happens to me every single day on social media platforms such as twitter and facebook since i joined twitter in two thousand and eleven misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated they will dog my every step my spirituality my faith being a hillbilly i can say that you can 't all of it is fair game i 've tried engaging people this one guy was sending me nasty stuff and there was a girl in his avatar i wrote him back and said i feel a lot of fear that you may think about and talk to women this way and he surprised me by saying you know what sometimes people want to be held accountable i was married to a scot for fourteen years so i said cunt means many different things in different countries but i 'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick to rise above it i 've tried to get in the trenches but mostly i would scroll through these social media platforms with one eye partially closed trying not to see it but you can 't make a cucumber out of a pickle and i was always secretly hoping in some part of me that what was being said to me and about me wasn who worships at the altar of gloria internalize the patriarchy this is really critical patriarchy is not boys and men it is a system in which we all participate including me on that particular day for some reason that particular tweet after the basketball game triggered something called a cyber mob this vitriolic rape threats and don 't you know when i was sitting at home alone in my nightgown i got a phone call and it was my beloved former husband and he said on a voice mail happening to you is not ok and there was something about him taking a stand for me that night that allowed me to take a stand for myself and i started to write i started to write about sharing the fact that i 'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three rapes and the hate speech i get in response to that these are just some of the being told my righteous ass and i did that alone and i published it alone because my chief advisor said please don 't the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable i fear for you but i trust girls and i trust women and i trust our allies it was published it went viral it proves that every single day online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all all over the world and when it is intersectional it is worse it 's clearly traumatizing our are so gravely affected because the threat of violence is experienced neurobiologically and let 's talk about work our ability to work is constrained online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them false allegations they have stds addresses indicating that they are available for sex with real examples of people showing up at this house for said sex our ability to go to school is impaired ninety six percent of all postings of sexual images our boys are two to three times more likely and i want to say a word about revenge porn part of what came out of this tweet was my getting connected with allies and other activists who are fighting for a safe and free internet expanding freedom and that website provides a critical forum because there is no global legal thing to help us figure this out but we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions because it 's hard to attack a behavior in the right way if we 're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior it is the nonconsensual sharing of an image used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman that attempts to pornography us our natural sexuality is i don 't know about yours pretty gorgeous and wonderful and my expressing i have all these resources that i 'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not i was able to start the speech project with colleagues hasn 't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet i actually pay someone and guess what i get hate speech for that oh you live in an having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open saying they can 't wait to cum on my face i have a right to set that boundary distinction between virtual and real is specious because and i had to do work on that but you know what we do we take all of this and we give that data so that we understand the intersectionality of it we 're going to win this fight there are a lot of solutions thank goodness i 'm going to offer just a few and of course i challenge you to create and contribute your own number one we have to start with digital media literacy and clearly it must have kids schools caregivers parents it 's essential two shall we talk about our friends in tech said with dignity and standard for gender equality is the minimum standard and guess what silicon valley if l 'oral in india in the philippines in brazil and in russia can do it only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies including building platforms from the ground up will the conversations about priorities and solutions change and more love for my friends in tech profiteering off misogyny in video games must end # gamergate was when you 're still making billions of dollars off games that maim and dump women for sport basta as the italians would say enough our friends in law enforcement have much to do because we 've seen that online violence is an extension of in our country more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners we care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there fifteen eight hundred and twenty eight women used intimate partner violence services in this country that is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them law enforcement must be empowered the police wanted to be helpful when but they couldn 't really when they said what 's twitter our legislators must write and pass astute legislation that reflects today 's technology and our notions of free and hate speech in new york law could not be applied to a perpetrator because the crimes must have been committed even if it was anonymous they must have been committed by telephone in mail by telegraph laughter the language must be technologically neutral i 've got a pretty let 's talk about our friends white men you have a role to play and a choice to make you can do something or you can do nothing we 're cool in this room but when this goes out everyone will say oh my god she 's a reverse racist that quote was said by a white man he asked me to include it in my talk so victims can help each other we must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening ninety two percent of young people twenty nine and under witness it we must have the courage and urgency to practice stopping it as it is unfolding believe her this is and as i believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred i recently learned about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions it takes five of those to offset one negative interaction and gratitude in particular free available globally any time anywhere to anyone in any dialect it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate a watershed part of the brain that floods it so i 'm going to say awesome stuff about myself i would like for you to reflect it back to me it might sound something like this i am a powerful and strong woman and you would say love you thank you so much for letting me"
