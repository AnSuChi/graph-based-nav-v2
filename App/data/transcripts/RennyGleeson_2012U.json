  "transcript": "what i want to try to do is tell a quick story about a four hundred and four page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a four hundred and four page actually is four page is that it 's that broken experience on the web it 's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it can 't find it and and i just want you to think a little bit about remember for yourself it 's annoying four hundred and four come from it 's from a family of errors actually a whole set of relationship errors which when i started digging into them it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey sites small this is a a global experience what a four hundred and four page tells you is that you fell through the cracks and that 's not a good experience when you 're used to experiences like this you can get on your kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone a four hundred and four page is not what you 're looking for you get that and you say hey could you bring the skim milk and they walk out from behind the counter and they 've got no pants on into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator and we had eight startups sitting around there and those startups are focused on what they are not what they 're not until one day athletepath which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes found this video because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a four hundred and four so this turned into a contest commiserated with your pet this is one that commiserates with you this is one that blames you this is one that i loved so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be because back to the whole relationship issue what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you 're not"
