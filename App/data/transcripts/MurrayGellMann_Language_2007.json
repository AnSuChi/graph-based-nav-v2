  "transcript": "i 'm involved in other things besides and the professional historical linguists in the u s and in western europe mostly try to stay away from any long distance relationships big groupings groupings that go back i don 't think it 's crank who are working on that at santa fe institute and in moscow and i would love to see where that leads does it really lead to a single ancestor some when there was presumably a competition among many how far back does modern language go how many tens of thousands of years does it go back chris anderson do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the in the soft clay in the caves in western europe in the aurignacian period some i can 't believe they did all those things and didn 't also have a modern language so i would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further that doesn 't mean that all or many or most of today 's attested languages couldn 't descend perhaps from one that 's much younger than that like say twenty thousand years or something of that kind it 's what we call a bottleneck"
