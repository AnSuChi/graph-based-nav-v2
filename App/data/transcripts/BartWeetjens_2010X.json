  "transcript": "which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis hamsters gerbils squirrels you name it i bred it and i sold them to pet shops we had african students in the house and i learned exuberant cultural diversity and i focused on appropriate detection but i wasn 't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society we 're talking ' princess diana is announcing on tv that landmines form a structural barrier actually there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable we chose rats why would you choose rats well actually rats are in contrary to what most people think about them rats are highly sociable our product what you see here there 's a target somewhere here you see an operator a trained african with his rats in front who actually there the animal finds a mine it scratches on the soil and the animal comes back very very simple very sustainable in this environment very very simple now why would you use rats rats have been used since the ' 50s last century in all kinds of more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species moreover they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it now how do we communicate with rats well but we have a clicker a standard method for animal training which you see there with which you can reinforce particular behaviors first of all we associate the click sound with a food reward which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe once the animal knows click food click food click food so click is food and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets animals learn to find real mines in real minefields and accredited according to international mine action standards just like dogs have to pass a test this consists of four hundred square meters there 's a number of mines placed blindly and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all if the animal does that it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field maybe one slight difference we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog this is our team in mozambique one tanzanian trainer who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows and you should see the pride in the eyes of these people they have a skill moreover this small team de miners to follow up but we have demonstrated in mozambique that we can reduce the per square meter we can actually make the output even they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region and they endorse hero rats but let me bring you to a very different problem and there 's about six thousand people last year that walked on a landmine but worldwide last year almost one point nine million died from tuberculosis as a reaches from forty to sixty percent reliability in tanzania the numbers don 't lie forty five percent of people it means that if you have t b you have more chance that you won 't be detected but will just die from t b secondary infections and so on and you are detected very early diagnosed early treatment can start and even in hippocrates have actually can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients trained rats on them and we can reach eighty nine percent sensitivity eighty six percent specificity using multiple rats in a row this is how it works and really this is a generic technology we 're talking now explosives tuberculosis but can you imagine you can actually put anything under there so how does it work you have a cassette with ten samples you put these ten samples at once in the cage an animal only needs two hundredths of a second goes extremely fast here it 's already at the third sample this is a positive sample it gets a click sound and comes for the food reward and by doing so very fast we can have like a second line opinion to see which patients are positive which are negative whereas a microscopist can process forty samples in a day a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only a cage like this a cage like this provided that you have rats and we have now currently twenty five tuberculosis rats a cage like this operating throughout the day can process one thousand six hundred and eighty samples can you imagine the potential offspring applications environmental detection of pollutants in soils customs applications detection of illicit goods in containers and so on i just want to briefly highlight the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of five hundred thousand people where fifteen thousand reported to get a test done microscopy for one thousand eight hundred patients and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back we were able to increase case detection rates by over thirty percent throughout last year we 've been depending on which intervals you take we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between thirty and forty percent healthy people per year you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives at least our hero rats have saved lots of lives and to semi automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on this is in a prototype stage we don 't have a working system here yet plenty available so something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you whether they are environmental technological animal or human and thank you very much"
