  "transcript": "frugal digital is essentially a small research group at c i d where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society that 's what we it 's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have while about two thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology including health care education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues before i start i want to talk about a little anecdote a little story about a man i met he has this little it 's incredible because i couldn 't believe my eyes when i once just happened to bump into him basically what he does is he has all these services for micro payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world more importantly he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons you know for the prepaid subscriptions but then in the backside he 's got this little nook any cell phone any gadget you can bring them they can fix it and it 's pretty incredible because i took my iphone there and he was like yeah do you want an upgrade yes i was a bit skeptical but then i decided to give him a nokia instead this reverse engineering and know how that 's built into this little two meters and they can fix anything so quickly you can hand over a phone this it 's even happening in africa like for example in cape town we did extensive research but what fuels this it 's this entire ecosystem of low cost parts and supplies and you can even buy salvaged parts basically you don 't have to necessarily buy brand new things you have sort of approach give us that 's the real question because this is something that 's been there part of every society that 's but there 's an interesting paradigm there 's the traditional they 're not something that 's been established it 's not so we said what can we get out of this you know like what are the key values that we can get out of this which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn 't have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it and then the most important thing is it gives us large math for low cost so it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices what we call this is a silicon cottage industry it 's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re happening in a whole new way in small digital shops so we kind of and we said what can we do with this can we make a little product or a service out of it so one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform we call it a lunch box basically one of the that we studied was but it 's really about holistic education so we said so we said what are the steps required to empower the teacher how do you make this teacher into a digital gateway and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally we went and scavenged markets and we tried to understand what can we pick up that will make this happen so essentially the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform it allows us to get online and allows us to load up files of different formats and play them l e d and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack and we took it back out comes this a little lunch box form factor so you don 't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things we extended we tested it many times over and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy but most importantly connect because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there 's not enough electricity or erratic electricity and the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a usb key because we realized that even though there was gprs and all that on paper at least in but it 's not limited to just it 's about this little device called a medi meter it 's basically a a little health care screening tool that we developed in india there is a context of these amazing people the health care workers called asha workers they are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained and the main purpose is basically to but the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research but what happens at the public health care system is incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system simply because there 's not enough doctors and and facilities for the population that 's being referred so everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention and there 's no priorities so we said come on there 's got to be a better way of doing this for sure so we said what can we do with the asha worker that 'll allow this asha worker to become an interesting filter but not just a filter a really well thought through referral system and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations so the real key question was how do we empower this woman how do we empower her with simple tools that 's not diagnostic but more screening she at least knows how to advise the patients better and that 'll make such a huge difference on the system because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel often sometimes seven to fifteen kilometers sometimes by foot to get a simple health check done is very very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care so if there was something that she could do that would be amazing so what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device i want to demo this actually because it 's a very simple process bruno do you want to join us come along so what we 're going to do is that we 're going to measure a few basic parameters on you including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that so you 're going to put your thumb on top of this so it 's taking a little reading from you and then the pointer goes and points to three different options let 's see what happens here beeps oh bruno you can go home it basically meant you had to have sort of more continuous care from the health care worker so that was a very simple three step screening process that could basically change the so essentially the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today and a few parts that have to be pre programmed basically this is a so we are right now we are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up because there are over two hundred and fifty thousand asha workers on the and if we can give and it changes the way systems actually function not just and we hope to do this in a big way thank you"
