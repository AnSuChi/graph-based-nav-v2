  "transcript": "were displaced by natural disasters in two thousand and ten now there was nothing particularly special about two thousand and a half million people are displaced by natural disasters every single year last year alone ninety nine federally declared disasters were on file with fema from joplin and tuscaloosa alabama now how does the most powerful country in the world handle these displaced people because academia tells you after a major disaster there 's typically about an 18 month time frame to we kinda recover start the recovery process but what most people don 't realize is that on average it takes forty five to sixty days or more for the infamous fema trailers to even begin to show up so i became obsessed with trying to figure out a way to actually fill this gap this actually became my creative obsession so i started sketching two days after katrina i started sketching and sketching and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this and i started experimenting making models talking to experts in the field taking their feedback and refining and i kept on refining and refining for nights and weekends for over five years now my obsession ended up driving me to create full size prototypes in my own backyard and actually spending my own personal savings on everything from tooling to patents and but in the end i ended up with this modular housing system that can react to any situation or disaster it can be put up in any environment from an asphalt parking lot because it doesn 't require any special setup or specialty tools and it actually sleeps four people which give you this communal area for people to actually spill out into so they 're not actually trapped inside these units now this fundamentally changes the way we respond to disasters because gone basically like a coffee cup they can actually stack together so we get extremely efficient transportation and storage out of them in fact fifteen exos can fit on a but i 'm obsessive so i couldn 't just stop there so i actually started modifying the bunks where you could actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving so the same unit can now be used for an office or storage location the doors can actually swap out so you can actually put on a which gives you larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces so now this same kit of parts this same unit can actually serve as a living room like a great idea but how do you make it real so the first idea i had initially was just to go the federal and state governments and go here take it for free but i was quickly told that boy our government doesn 't really work like that okay okay so maybe i would start a nonprofit to kind of help consult and get this idea going our government looks to private sector for things like this but i was quickly told by some corporations that my personal passion project was not a brand fit now i wasn 't just so i actually scheduled sleep on my calendar and spent the 8 hour time difference on conference calls with material suppliers manufacturers and potential customers and if his body language is any indication that 's the owner of what it 's like for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer you 've got to see what happens here but g s industries was fantastic they actually built three prototypes for us by hand and they actually shipped them here to texas for us now a funny thing started happening other people started to believe in what we were doing and actually offered us so now we had a hangar hangar space to work in and prototypes to demo with"
