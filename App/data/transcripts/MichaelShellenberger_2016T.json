bill gates is and so you might start to ask is this whole global warming problem going to be a lot easier to solve than anybody imagined but what we found really surprised us the first thing is that clean energy has been increasing this is electricity from clean energy sources over the last twenty it 's actually been in decline from thirty six percent to thirty one percent and if you care about climate change you 've got to go in the opposite direction to one hundred percent of our electricity from clean energy sources as quickly as possible how much could five percentage points of global electricity be well it turns out to be quite a bit it 's the equivalent of sixty nuclear plants the size of diablo canyon california 's last nuclear plant or nine hundred a big part of this is simply that fossil fuels are increasing faster than clean energy and that 's understandable there 's just a lot but there 's something else going on which is that one of those and that 's nuclear you can see its generation has declined seven percent over the last ten years now but the data says something different when you combine all the electricity from solar and wind you see it actually barely makes up half of the decline from nuclear let 's take a closer look in the united states over the last couple of years really two thousand and thirteen two thousand and fourteen and so the consequence was that we wiped out almost as much clean energy electricity that we get from solar and it 's not unique to us people think of california as a clean energy and climate leader but when we looked at the data what we found is that in fact california reduced emissions more slowly than the national average between two thousand and two thousand and fifteen german emissions have actually been going up since two thousand and nine and there 's really not anybody who 's going to tell you that they 're going to meet their climate commitments in two thousand and twenty the reason isn 't hard to understand solar and wind provide power about ten to twenty percent of the time every time you put electricity into a battery and take it out you lose about to forty percent of the power we try to deal with all the solar we 've brought online we now get about ten percent of electricity from solar we need a lot of natural gas backup so what we 've been doing is stuffing a lot of natural gas into the side of a mountain and that worked pretty well for a while but then late last year it sprung a leak so much methane gas was released it was the equivalent of putting half a million cars on the road it basically blew through all of our climate commitments for the year well so we traveled to india a few months ago we met with all the top officials solar nuclear the rest and what they told us is and that 's just the start of it say we want to get to one hundred gigawatts by two thousand and twenty two but last year we did just five and the year before that we did five so let 's just take a closer look at nuclear the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change has looked at the carbon content of all these different fuels and nuclear comes out really low it 's actually lower even than solar during a year a single plant can provide power ninety two percent of the time what 's interesting is that when you look at countries that have deployed different kinds of clean energies so nuclear seems like a pretty good option but there 's this big problem with it which all of you i 'm sure are aware of which is that people really don 't like it there was a study a survey done of people around the world not just in the united states or europe about a year and a half ago and what they found is that nuclear is actually one of the least popular forms of energy even oil is more popular than nuclear and so what is it that we fear there 's really three things there 's the safety of the plants themselves the fears that they 're going to melt down and cause damage there 's the waste from them and there 's the association with that 's why bill gates is in china developing advanced reactors that 's why forty different entrepreneurs are working on so when the climate scientist james hansen asked if i wanted to go to china with him and i had in my mind that the chinese would be able to do with nuclear what they did with so many other things start to crank out small nuclear reactors on assembly lines ship them up like iphones or macbooks and send them around the world i would get one at home in berkeley the presentations were all very exciting and very promising they have multiple reactors that they 're working on and they said we 're going to have a thorium molten salt reactor ready for sale to the world by and your cities are really polluted by the way and your department of energy hasn 't been particularly forthcoming with all that data you guys have on testing i 've got an idea you know how you 've got ten years where you 're demonstrating that reactor let 's just skip that part and let 's just go right to commercializing it that will save money and time and the engineer just looked at me and said let me ask you a question would you buy a car that had never been demonstrated before so what about the other reactors there 's a reactor that 's coming online they 're starting to sell it it 's a high temperature gas reactor it can 't melt down and nobody thinks it 's going to ever get cheaper than the reactors that we have and most people think that if you 're including that waste part of the process it 's just going to make the whole machine a lot more expensive it 's just adding another complicated step the truth is we went to india and asked about the nuclear program the government said before the paris climate talks that they were going to do something like and in most of the world especially the rich world they 're not talking about building new reactors we 're actually talking about taking reactors down before their lifetimes are over germany 's actually pressuring its neighbors to do that i which would wipe out forty percent of the emissions reductions we 're supposed to get under the clean power plan of course in japan they took all their nuclear plants offline replaced them with coal and they 're only expected to bring online about a third to to two thirds so when we went through the numbers and just added that up how much nuclear do we see china and india bringing online over the next fifteen years how much do we see at risk of being taken offline this was the most startling finding what we found is that the world is actually at risk of losing four so it 's understandable that engineers would look for a technical fix to the fears that people have of nuclear but when you consider that these are big challenges to that they 're going to take a long time to solve there 's this other issue which is are those technical fixes really going to solve people 's fears let 's take safety despite what people think it 's hard to figure out how to make nuclear power much safer i mean every medical journal that looks at it this is the most recent study from the british journal lancet one of the most respected journals in the world nuclear is the safest way to make reliable power everybody 's scared of the accidents so you go look at the accident data and they 're panicking because the harm that 's caused isn 't actually caused by the machines or the radiation everyone worries about the waste well the interesting thing about the waste is how little of it there is this is just from one plant and people say it 's poisoning people or doing something it 's not it 's just sitting there it 's just being monitored there 's not very much of it by contrast the waste that we don 't control from energy and the truth is that even if we get good at using that waste as fuel there 's always going to be some fuel left over that means there 's always going to be people that think it 's a big problem for reasons that maybe don 't have as much to do with the actual waste as we think decide to go get a weapon in fact it works the opposite then we 're going to need a lot more nuclear power the engineer that brought bill gates there kind of pulled me aside and he said you know i we can crank out these machines on assembly lines we do know how to make things cheap but there 's just not enough people that want them let 's do solar and wind and efficiency and conservation let 's accelerate the advanced nuclear programs i think we should triple the amount of money we 're spending on it but i just think the most important thing if we 're going to overcome the climate crisis is to keep in mind that the cause of the clean energy crisis thank you very much"
