  "transcript": "most people don 't know that when i went to high school in this country i and i came from a very privileged background i was very lucky my family was wealthy and my father believed in one and he was a clever man he sort of said well that 's ok but you 've done very well in your math sats in fact i 'd got an eight hundred and he said if you go to mit to which i had been given early admission in graduate or undergraduate as much as you want i will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in paris and i decided that if i was good in art and i was good in mathematics i 'd study architecture which was the blending of the two i went and told my headmaster that and i said to him what i was doing that i was going to go study architecture because it was art and and mathematics put together he said to me something that just went completely over my head he said you know but i don 't like grey pin striped suits and i thought what a turkey this guy is and i went off to mit i studied architecture then did a second degree in architecture and then actually and that that really was the the place to bring both and enjoyed a a career doing that and probably if i were to fill out jim citrin 's put one hundred percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative and after doing this for a long time and the media lab passing the baton on i thought well maybe it 's time for me to do a project something that would be knowing people who were either executives or wealthy and also not having in my own case a career to worry about anymore my career i mean i 'd done my career didn 't have to worry and i said boy let 's really do something that takes advantage of all these features and thought that if we could address education by leveraging the children to the world the access of the computers that that was really the thing we should do never shown this picture before and probably going to be sued for it it 's taken at three o 'clock in the morning without the permission of the company it 's about two weeks old there they are folks this is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by but then you 'll see the ones up above what happens is they burn into flash memory the software and then test them for a few hours but you 've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line because it 's constant so they go around in this loop which is why you see them up there so this was great for a real turning point but it goes back this picture was taken in just before the ibm pc was even announced seymour papert and i were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself but one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here and when people tell me who 's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids i say to myself what planet do you come from ok we all all need help even those of us who are very seasoned this picture of seymour twenty five years ago seymour made a very and when they debug the programs they come the closest to learning about learning that was very important and in some sense we 've lost that but programming is absolutely fundamental and a third that i 've never even seen before the point being this is going to be very very intensive on the programming side this photograph is very important because it 's much later set up this school that we had built just as the school connected it to the internet and these kids we started one laptop per child this is the same village in cambodia just of months ago these kids are real pros the clarity of purpose is there the moral purpose is clear i can see any head of state any executive and the second is very counterintuitive you can get the best people in the world including communications including legal services and they 're the best people we put out a job description for a cfo at zero salary and we had a queue of people and the u n allowed us crank it 's different it was getting its power in a different way it 's kind of childlike even though this wasn 't the direction we went in spite of what some people in the press don 't get it didn 't understand it we didn 't take it off because we didn 't want to do having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want you want a separate thing like the ac adaptor i didn 't bring one with me but they really work much better off board and then i could tell you lots about the laptop but i decided on just four things just keep in mind because there are other people including bill gates who said gee you 've got a real computer that computer is unlike anything you 've had and does things there are four of them that you don 't come close to and it 's very important to be low power and i hope that 's picked up more by the industry you want to be below two watts is that 's roughly what you can generate with your upper body dual mode display that sunlight display 's fantastic we were using it at lunch today in the sunlight and the more sunlight the better and that was really critical the mesh network it 'll become commonplace and of course rugged goes without saying and the reason i think design matters isn 't because i wanted to go to art school and by the way when i graduated from mit i thought the worst and silliest thing to would be to go to paris for six years so i didn 't do that but design matters for a number of reasons the most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design cheap labor cheap components and making a cheap laptop and in has a double meaning which is really appropriate because it 's cheap in the pejorative sense as well as inexpensive but if you take a different approach and you think of very large scale integration very advanced materials very advanced manufacturing so you 're pouring chemicals in one end ipods are spewing out the other and really cool design that 's what we wanted to do and i can race through these and save a lot of time because yves and i obviously didn 't compare notes these are his slides and so i don 't have to talk about them but it was really to us very important as a strategy it wasn 't just to kind of make it cute because somebody you know good design is very important yves showed one of the the the mesh network the reason i i and i won 't go into it in great detail but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world they 're connected there 's not just laptops and so we have to drop in satellite dishes we put in generators it 's a lot of stuff that goes behind these these can talk to each other they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart if you 're in the jungle it 's about five hundred meters so if a kid bicycles home or walks a few miles they 're going to be off the grid so to speak they 're not going to be near another laptop so you have to nail these onto a tree english is by far the minority latin is relatively rare too you just look at some of the languages i 'm willing to suspect some of you hadn 't even heard of them before is there anybody in the room one person unless you work with olpc is there anybody in the there 's only one hand so you get it there is no keyboard standard because there 's no market and this is the big difference again when you 're a nonprofit you look at children as a mission not as a market so what i want to end with is sort of what we 're doing to roll it out and we changed strategy completely i decided at the beginning it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning it 's not what we 're doing now is to go to six countries big countries one of them is not so big but it 's rich here 's the six we went to the six and in each case the head of state said he would do it he 'd we thought this is exactly the right strategy get it out and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries and so i went to each of those countries at least six times met with the head of state probably two or three times in each case not something you 'd envy or want to do in the case of libya it was a lot of fun meeting gaddafi in his tent the camel smells were unbelievable and it was forty five degrees c i mean this was not what you 'd call a cool experience and a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity make a press release so we went to smaller ones uruguay bless their hearts small country not so rich president said he 'd do it and guess what he did do it the tender had nothing in it that related to us nothing specific about but just a vanilla laptop proposal and guess what we won it hands down when it was announced that they were going to do every child in uruguay the first one hundred thousand boom went to olpc the next day day the next day not even twenty four hours had passed in peru the president of peru said we 'll do two hundred and fifty and boom a little domino effect the president of rwanda stepped in and said he would do it the president of ethiopia and so what happens is these things start to happen with these countries all those countries it didn 't quite get to thing so we said let 's start a program in the united states we decide to do this we announced it near the middle end just when the clinton initiative was taking place we thought that was a good time to announce it launched it on the twelve of november we said it would be just for a short period until the twenty six we 've extended it until the give one get one program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested the first day it was just let 's get people to give many but maybe give one hundred give one thousand and that 's where you come in and that 's where i think it 's very important i don 't want you all to go out and buy four hundred dollars worth of laptops and it 's not to go out and buy one hundred or one thousand though i invite you to do that and ten thousand would be even better tell people about it it 's got to become i won 't dwell on the pricing at all just to say that when you do the give one get one a lot of press is a bit about they didn 't make it it 's one hundred and eighty eight dollars it 's not one hundred it will be one hundred in two years it will go below one hundred we 've pledged not to add features and we let them push it up for for all sorts of reasons so what you can do i 've just said it don they got them by ship and i 'm talking now about seven thousand eight thousand at a time they went to uruguay maybe by the middle of the year to hit a million a month now put that number and a million isn 't so much it 's not a big selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year but a million a month in so i 'm standing here telling you that sometime next year we 're going to make twenty percent of the world production and we hope if you have eg two years from now or whenever you have it again and will have hopefully by then maybe one hundred million out there to children"
