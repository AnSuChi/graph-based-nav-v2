  "transcript": "for the past few years i 've been spending my summers and there what i 've been doing is essentially renting a boat what i would like to do is ask you to come on a boat ride with me tonight so we ride off from eel pond equipped with a drone to identify potential spots from which to peer into the atlantic earlier i was going to say into the depths of the atlantic here barely two miles away from we lower a simple plankton net into the water and bring up to the surface things that humanity rarely pays any attention to and oftentimes has never seen before here 's one of the organisms that we caught in our net this is a and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science a complete new species or how about this other transparent beauty progeny that will move on to reproduce sexually let me say that again this animal is growing progeny that is going to reproduce sexually in the next generation a weird jellyfish not quite this is an ascidian this is a group of animals that now we know we share extensive genomic ancestry with meet your cousin thalia democratica laughter i 'm pretty sure you didn 't save a spot at your but let me tell you these animals are profoundly related to us in ways that we 're just beginning to understand i hope that you 'll remember the trip that we just took today many sciences only see value in studying deeper what we already know we crave the experience of being completely baffled by something we 've never seen i was the first one to discover that because in this type of discovery research if you don 't feel like a complete idiot most of the time you 're just not sciencing hard enough summer i bring onto the deck of this little boat of ours more and more things that we know very little about i would like tonight to tell you a story about life that rarely gets told in an environment like this from the vantage point of our we sense that after centuries of scientific research we 're beginning to make significant inroads into understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases these are but some of the undesirables we wish to tame why is it that we are having so much trouble trying to solve the problem of cancer is it that we 're trying to solve the and not trying to understand life and i can summarize three point five billion years of the history of life on this planet in a single slide what you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet we occupy a rather unremarkable position homo sapiens as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is we relentlessly but this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize and to produce practical outcomes is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths we are measuring an astonishingly narrow sliver of life and hoping that those numbers will save all of our lives how narrow do you ask well let me give you a number the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently estimated that about ninety five percent of our oceans remain unexplored now let that sink in for a second very safe to say that we don 't even know how much about life we do not know so it 's not surprising that every week in my field we begin to see the addition of more and more new species to this amazing tree of life this one for example discovered earlier this summer new to science and now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree what is even more tragic is that we know about but their biology remains sorely under studied and there are animals out there that do truly astounding things willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm little guy right here does things that essentially just blow my mind you can grab one of these animals and cut it into eighteen different fragments and each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate a for the past decade and a half or so i 've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do and how they pull this magic trick off but like all good magicians they 're not really releasing their secrets readily to me so here we are after twenty years of essentially chin scratching and thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations we still don 't fully understand how these animals do what they do each planarian an ocean unto itself full of unknowns one of the common characteristics of all of these animals i 've been talking to you about is that they did not appear to have received the memo that they need to behave according to the rules that we have meet our nobel prize winners seven species essentially this little guy right here three nobel prizes in twelve years after all the attention they have garnered and all the knowledge they have generated as well as the lion 's share of the funding and that 's because unfortunately these seven animals essentially correspond to zero point zero zero zero nine percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet and at worst is leading us astray that 's because life on this planet and its history is the history of rule breakers life started on the face of this planet as single cell organisms swimming for millions of years in the ocean until one of those creatures decided i 'm going to do and i 'm going to do this and i 'm sure it wasn 't a popular decision at the time but somehow and another creature thought once on land they may have looked up into the sky and i 'm going to fly you can 't break the law of gravity there 's no way you can fly and yet nature has invented multiple and independent times ways to fly shouldn 't how we study them also break the we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again clueless once but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea as we homo sapiens are the only species we know of that is driven to scientific inquiry like all other species on this planet are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet because i think that life is actually an open secret that has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it so i ask you aren what the heck are we waiting for thank you"
