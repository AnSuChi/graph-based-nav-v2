  "transcript": "four point six billion years of history in eighteen minutes let 's start with the first photograph the new york times wrote in its editorial mars is uninteresting it 's a dead world nasa should not spend any time or effort studying mars anymore leaders in washington at nasa headquarters knew better and we began a very extensive study of the red planet one of the key questions in all of science is there life outside of earth but let me start with viking photograph this is a composite taken by viking in we sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of one thousand nine this is the first photograph taken from the surface of any planet this is a viking lander photograph and yes the red planet is red the land area on mars is comparable to the land area on earth so mars is a pretty big place even though it 's we understand the elevation differences we know a lot about mars mars has interesting planet mars has the largest it was a really bad day on mars volcanoes are important because volcanoes produce atmospheres and they produce oceans the largest canyon in the solar system superimposed on a map of the united states three thousand miles across one of the most intriguing features about mars the national academy of science says one of the ten major mysteries of the on mars where for some reason we don 't understand why at this point the surface is very very highly magnetized the answer is no there is no liquid water on the surface of mars today but there is intriguing evidence that suggests that the early history of mars there may have been rivers and fast flowing water today mars is very very dry we believe there 's some water in the polar caps there are polar caps of north pole and south pole here are some recent images this is from why is water important water is important because if you want life you have to have water water is the this is my favorite picture this we now believe that in the early history of mars which is four point six billion years ago four point six billion years ago mars mars had rivers mars had lakes but more important mars had where did the ocean 's worth of water on mars go this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars orbiting satellite called odyssey sixteen percent by weight of the interior contains frozen water or ice was released earlier this year in the magazine science and what we 're looking at is the presence of the gas methane and you can see there are three distinct regions of methane why is methane important produced by living systems these are the three plumes a and this is the terrain it appears over and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on mars in fact the earth and mars are both four point six billion years old the oldest rock on earth is only three point six billion the reason there gap in our geological understanding is because of plate tectonics the crust of the earth has been recycled we have no geological record prior for the first billion years that record exists on mars and this terrain that we 're looking at dates back to four point six billion here is viking i viking ii this is opportunity hemisphere that 's because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient and that 's because the water protected the the basin from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites here 's hellas basin we asked this question we invited ten of the top mars scientists to the langley research center for two and we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question and the result of our meeting was a robotic it 's the langley research center we cover hundreds of miles we can do things that rovers can 't do and landers can 't do we can fly above mountains volcanoes impact craters we fly over valleys and we can search for life on mars equal importance we transmit those images back to earth but more important engineers and mathematicians and that 's a critical area of national security and economic vitality to make sure this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars we preprogram it we will fly where the methane is we will have instruments aboard the plane we will pinpoint where these gases emanate from because we can measure the gradient where it comes from we put it in a spacecraft the problem is the spacecraft 's largest diameter is nine feet and we transport it in a spacecraft and we have a little video that describes the sequence airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time we believe that in a one hour flight we can rewrite looking for studying the magnetism on the surface which we don 't understand as well as about a dozen other areas practice makes perfect how do we know we can do it several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels at the nasa langley research center for eight years under mars conditions and of equal importance is we test in the earth 's atmosphere which is comparable to the density and pressure of the atmosphere on mars where we 'll fly now one hundred thousand feet if you fly cross country to los angeles you fly thirty seven thousand feet this is a half scale model this is a and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly and we 've done we 're ready to go all we need is a check from nasa headquarters to cover the costs i 'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today 's talk for this mission this is the ares team we have about one hundred and fifty scientists engineers where we 're working with jet propulsion laboratory goddard space flight center ames research center and half a dozen major universities and corporations in developing this the first flight of an airplane outside of the earth"
