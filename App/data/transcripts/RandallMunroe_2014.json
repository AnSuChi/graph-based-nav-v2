  "transcript": "and i try to answer them using math science and comics so for example one person asked what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at ninety percent of the speed of light i did some calculations now normally when an object flies through the air the air will flow around the object but in this case the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldn 't have time to move out of the way the ball would smash right into and through them and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it now at this point about thirty nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasn 't had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong after seventy nanoseconds the ball will reach home plate or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and the catcher and the umpire and start disintegrating them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop which also starts to disintegrate ideally far away what you 'd see is a bright flash of light that would fade over a few seconds followed by a blast wave spreading out shredding trees and houses as it moves away from the and then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined city so the major league baseball rules are a little bit hazy but i think that in this situation the batter would be considered hit by pitch and i get people writing in with i 've had people write in about can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart 's broken and i 've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they 're trying to get me to do for them but one one week a couple months ago i got a question that was actually about google if all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards how big would google 's data warehouse be and i 've tried i 've met them a few times i started with money google has to reveal how much they spend in general and that lets you put some caps on and you can also then put a cap on how much of the i read a calculation at one point i think google has a drive failure about every minute or two and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one so they go through a huge number of them and so by looking at money you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have you can also look at power you can look at how much electricity they need you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and google is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have you can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know how big are they how much room is that how many server racks could you fit in and they also say because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided you might know what they made a deal to you can figure out but maybe you only have one of those you know and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don 't know it 's sort of circling around the number you 're trying to get and this is a lot of fun the math is not all that advanced i spent a day or two researching and there are some things i didn 't look at you could always look at the google recruitment messages that they post that gives you an idea of where they have people sometimes when people visit a data center they 'll take a cell cam photo and post it and they can just look at pizza delivery drivers turns out they know where all the google data centers are at least the ones that have people in them which i felt pretty good about that was about and then another maybe five exabytes offline storage in tape drives which it turns out google is about the world 's largest consumer of so i came up with this estimate and this this is a staggering amount of data it 's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know there 's a couple of other contenders especially everyone always thinks of the nsa but using some of these same methods we can look at the nsa 's data centers and figure out you know we don 't know what 's going on there but it 's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of google and so a punch card can hold about eighty characters which is about three times deeper than so this is this is impractical but i think and i posted it on my website i wrote it up and i didn 't expect to get an answer from google because of course they 've been so secretive they didn 't answer of my questions and so i just put it up and said but then a little while later open it up and it 's punch cards there 's a bunch of code and it said but i don 't really like math for its own sake and just by and i have a lot of stupid questions and i love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes and sometimes not this is a question i got from a reader an anonymous reader and the subject line just said urgent and this was the entire email if people had wheels and could fly how would we differentiate them from airplanes"
