  "transcript": "let 's find out by counting down the top ten myths of psychology but how different are men and women really to find out let 's start by looking at something on which men and women really do differ and plotting some psychological gender differences on the same scale one thing men and women do really differ on is how far they can throw so if we look at the data for men here we see what is called a normal distribution curve a few men can throw a ball really far and a few men not far at all but most a kind of average distance and women share the but actually there 's quite a big difference in fact the average man can throw a ball further than about ninety eight percent of all women but let 's have a look at the size of this difference it the average woman is better than thirty three percent of all men and of course if that was fifty percent then the two genders would be exactly equal it 's worth bearing in mind that this difference and the next one i 'll show you are pretty much the biggest so here 's the next one any psychologist will tell you that women are better with language and grammar than men so here 's performance on the standardized grammar that would represent complete case of mars and venus it 's more a case of if anything mars and snickers basically the same but one 's maybe slightly nuttier than the other i won 't say which now we 've got you warmed up let 's psychoanalyze you using the famous rorschach inkblot test so you can probably see two i dunno two bears or two people or something but what do you think they 're doing put your hand up if you think they 're saying hello if you think they 're fighting you 're a bit more of a nasty aggressive person are you a lover or a fighter basically what about this one this isn 't really a voting one so on three everyone shout out what you see one two three i heard hamster who said hamster that was very worrying a guy there said well you should see some kind of two legged animal here and then the mirror image of them there if you didn 't then this means that you it doesn 't mean that at all rorschach inkblot tests have basically no validity when it comes to diagnosing people 's are not used by modern day psychologists so let 's do another quick quiz to find out when making a cake do you prefer to so hands up for each one again do you prefer to use a recipe book with pictures yeah a few people have a friend talk you through or have a go making it up as you go along quite a few people there okay so if you said a then this means that you are a visual learner and you learn best when information is presented in a visual style if you said b it means you 're an auditory learner that you learn best when information except of course as you 've probably guessed that it doesn 't because the whole thing is a complete myth learning styles are made up and are not supported by scientific evidence it 's obvious that the best presentation format depends not on you but on what you 're trying to learn could you learn to drive a car for example just by listening to someone telling you what to do with no kinesthetic experience what you need to do is match the material to be learned to the presentation format not you so what this is all about is a recent study at university college london found that of the variation between different students and their gcse results was down to genetic factors that sounds like a very precise figure so how can we tell whereas non identical twins share one hundred percent so by comparing how similar gcse results are in identical twins versus non identical twins and doing some clever math we can an idea of how much variation and performance is due to the environment and how much is due to genes and it turns out that it 's about fifty eight percent one thing that you shouldn 't blame is being a so the myth here is that the left brain is logical it 's good with equations like this and the right brain is more creative so the right brain is better at music but again this is a myth because perhaps one reason why this myth has survived is that there is a slight grain of truth to it so a related version of the myth is that left handed people are more creative than right handed people which kind of makes sense because your brain what is true that ambidextrous people or people who use both hands for different tasks are more creative thinkers than because being ambidextrous involves having both sides of the brain talk to each other a lot which seems to be involved in left hander arises from the fact that being ambidextrous is more common amongst so a grain of truth in the idea of the creative left hander but not much this is again a complete myth nearly everything that we do even the most mundane thing uses nearly all of our brains that said it is of course true that most of us don 't use our brainpower so the idea is that listening to mozart makes you smarter and improves your performance on i q but a follow up study recruited some people who liked mozart music and then another group of people who were fans of the horror stories of stephen king and they played the people the music or the stories the people who preferred mozart i q boost from listening to the stephen king stories than the mozart music so the truth is that listening to something that you enjoy perks you up a bit and gives you a temporary i q boost on a narrow range of tasks there 's no suggestion that listening to mozart or indeed stephen king stories is going to make you any smarter the long run another version of the mozart myth is that listening to mozart can make you not only cleverer but healthier too arthritis and what most people think eventually killed him in the end syphilis this suggests that so a myth that i have to say is a famous study surveyed people from [ thirty seven ] different cultures across the globe from americans to zulus and in every single culture too women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power and in every culture so an average of three point four two years which is why we 've got here everybody needs a sugar daddy the myth here is that sportsmen go through hot hand streaks americans call them or purple if you toss a coin and because the brain likes to see patterns where there are none we look at these streaks and attribute meanings to them and say tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better which raises the question of if there 's any way that we could improve people 's performance and one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them this idea the effect that punishment can improve performance is what participants thought they were testing in milgram 's famous learning and punishment experiment that you 've probably heard about if you 're a psychology student story goes that participants were prepared to give what they believed to be fatal electric shocks to a fellow participant when they got a question wrong just because someone in a white coat told them to secondly the participants were told before the study and reminded any time they and thirdly participants didn 't give the shocks just because someone in the coat told them to when they were interviewed after the study all the participants said that they firmly believed that the learning and punishment study served a worthy scientific purpose which would have enduring gains for science as opposed to the momentary nonfatal whether but if so you 've probably completely failed because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns at chance when it comes to detecting lies from body language and verbal patterns interestingly there is one exception tv appeals for missing relatives it 's quite easy to predict when the relatives are missing and when the appealers have in fact murdered so hoax appealers are more likely to shake their heads to look away and to make errors in their so for example they might say taken from us rather than killed speaking of which it 's about time i killed this talk but before i do i just want to give you in thirty seconds the so the myth is that psychology is just a collection of interesting theories what we need to do is whether that is that listening to mozart makes you smarter that you learn better when information is presented in your preferred learning style or whatever it is all of these are testable empirical predictions and the only way we can make progress is to test these predictions against the data in tightly controlled experimental studies like all the ones i 've told you about today"
