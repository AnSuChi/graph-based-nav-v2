  "transcript": "hit me you know you know thirty years like i think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers i mean it 's point and click it 's like the menus icons it 's so much more subtle so much more and i 'd like to bring that experience to the desktop so i kind of have a this is this is bumptop it 's kind of like a new approach to you know manipulable and stuff i can let me just grab these guys i can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid or you know flip through them like a book or i can lay them out like a deck of cards when they 're laid out i can pull things to new locations or delete things or just quickly sort a whole pile you know just immediately right also if i want to add something to a pile well how do i do that i just toss it 's added right to the top it 's a kind of nice way also some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons we thought i mean how can we play with the idea of an icon and push that further and one of the things i can do is make it bigger but what 's really cool is that since there 's a physics simulation running under this it 's actually heavier so the lighter stuff despite computers everywhere paper really hasn 't disappeared because it has a lot of i think valuable properties and some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system so one of the things you can do to our icons just like paper is crease them and fold them just like paper remember something for later or if you want to be destructive you can just crumple it up and i can do the same thing post it notes and things like that around people 's offices and i can pull them off when i the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that you know okay well my real desk is really messy i don 't want that mess on my computer so one thing we have for that is like a grid align kind of so you get that more traditional desktop things are kind of grid aligned more boring but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop let just break this shelf okay i think beyond the icons i think another really cool domain for this software i think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop but browsing photographs i think you can really enrich photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing i can toss these things around they 're so so much more tangible and and touchable and you know i can double click on something to take a look at it and i can do all that kind of same stuff i showed you before so i can pile things up i can flip through it i can you know and i think it 's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting"
