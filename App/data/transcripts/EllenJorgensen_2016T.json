  "transcript": "has everybody heard of crispr i would be shocked if you hadn 't this is a technology it 's for genome editing should we bring back the woolly mammoth and my personal favorite how can we justify wiping out an entire species that we consider harmful to humans off the face of the earth using this technology this type of science is moving much faster than the regulatory mechanisms that govern it and so for the past six years i 've made it my personal mission to make sure that as many people as possible understand these types of technologies and their implications now crispr has been and the words that are used most often are easy and cheap so what i want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the the myths and the crispr the first thing that you have to do is damage the dna and then the cellular repair processes kick in and then we convince those repair processes to make the edit that we want and not a natural edit that 's how it works so the cas9 i love to anthropomorphize so the cas9 is kind of this pac man thing that wants to chew dna and the guide rna is the leash that 's keeping it and the combination of the part that 's amazing about it is that the guide rna only twenty letters of it are what target the system this is really easy to design and it 's really cheap to this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use and when they find a spot where the guide rna matches it rips them apart that triggers the cas9 protein to cut you 've got a cell that 's in total panic because now it 's got a piece of dna that 's broken the first just takes the dna and shoves the two pieces back together because what happens is sometimes a base drops out or a base is added but it 's not the the way that we really want to do genome editing the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting in this repair pathway it takes a homologous piece of dna and now mind you in a diploid organism like people we 've got one copy of our genome from our mom and one from our dad so if one gets damaged it can use the other chromosome to repair it so that 's where this comes from and now the genome is safe again so now you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled you can take letters out but most importantly you can stuff new dna in kind of like a trojan horse the thing that 's special about it is this we can actually put it exactly where we want it the thing is that there 's a lot of talk about it being cheap and it being easy and i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like hey can i come to your open night and like maybe use crispr and engineer my genome it is cheap in comparison it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars and it cuts the time a lot too it can cut it from weeks you still need a professional lab to do the work in you 're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab i mean don 't listen to anyone who says you can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table it 's really not easy to do this kind of work not to mention there 's a patent battle going on so even if you do invent something the broad institute are in this incredible patent battle it 's really fascinating to watch it happen because they 're accusing each other of fraudulent claims and then they 've got people saying oh well i signed my notebook here or there and when it is you can bet you 're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee in order to use this stuff so is it really cheap we don 't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway and some cells would rather do the other and besides that there 's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell in the first place in a petri dish that 's not that hard but if you 're trying to do it on a whole organism it gets really tricky it 's ok if you use something like blood or bone marrow those are the targets of a lot of research now there was a great story of some little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out editing it and putting it back with a precursor of crispr and we don 't know what the long term effects of that are plus what 's going to happen over time with that if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system it is now the other thing is we don 't really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to do really really important work like making better models of diseases in animals for example or for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats or even doing really basic research on what genes and what 's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported we 've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people to spend all their time doing research that makes us all the inventors of crispr because really only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies the use of these technologies and make sure that in the end it 's a positive outcome for both the planet and for us thanks"
