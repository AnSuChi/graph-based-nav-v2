  "transcript": "is more than belief it 's power and it 's influence we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability if there were a multinational organization government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board not one woman could have a not one woman could handle any financial matter i was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up i played pickup i said i was going to be the first female president of the united states i have been fighting for the equal rights amendment which has been dead for forty years i 'm the first woman in both sides of my family i never accepted being excluded because i was a woman except in my religion throughout all of that time i was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox mormon religion and i grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that i 'd known my whole life you get married a some of the rules we had but you followed the rules because you loved the people and you loved the religion and you believed everything about mormonism determined what you wore who you dated who you married it determined what underwear we wore i was the kind of religious i donated ten percent i was the kind of religious where i heard parents tell children when they 're leaving on a two year proselytizing mission mission that they would rather have them die than return home without having sinned i was the type and the kind of religious where kids kill themselves every single year instantaneous mutual aid this was where i felt safe this is certainty and clarity about life disciplinary councils in decision making capacities and i gave my religion a free pass and i realized that i had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men we 've been working very very very hard for the last decade and more the first thing we did was raise consciousness you can 't change what you can 't see i created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community we tried to do things that were like wearing pants to church they were enormously costly we lost jobs we got hate mail on a daily basis we were attacked in social media and national press we lost standing in our community some of us got excommunicated most of us got put in front of a disciplinary council and were rejected from the communities that we loved because we wanted to make them better because we believed that they could be and i began to expect this reaction from my own people i know what it feels like when you feel like someone 's trying to change you or or criticize you but what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work i received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left the same vehemence and what my secular friends didn 't realize was that this religious hostility these phrases of oh all religious people are crazy or stupid don 't pay attention to religion they 're going to be homophobic and sexist what they didn 't understand it bred religious extremism and i know because i remember someone telling me that i was stupid for being mormon and i didn 't listen to these arguments when i hear these arguments i still continue to bristle because i have family and friends how do we respect someone 's religious beliefs while still holding them accountable for the harm or damage that those beliefs may cause others it 's a tough question i still don 't have a perfect answer my parents and i have been walking on this tightrope for the last they 're intelligent people they 're lovely people and let me try to help you understand their perspective showing my shoulders i won 't be with my family in the eternities but even more die in a tragic accident at fifteen and something as simple as this means we won 't be together as a family and to my parents they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women 's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again and that 's the mindset that we 're dealing with and criticism does not change that and so my parents and i have been walking this tightrope but actually invalidating each other 's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives and it 's been difficult the way that we 've been able to do that is to get past those defensive shells and really see the soft inside of unbelief and belief and try to respect each other while still holding boundaries clear the other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right what they all don 't understand i cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said if you don 't like religion just leave why would you try to change it because what is taught on the sabbath leaks into our politics our health policy violence around the world it leaks into education military fiscal decision making these laws get legally and culturally codified during prop eight my church raised over twenty two million dollars to fight same sex marriage and we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules or we can ask ourselves gender inequality the default around the world why is that the assumption because religion doesn 't just create the roots of morality it creates the seeds of normality religions can liberate or subjugate they can empower or exploit they can comfort or destroy and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical moral are often not those in charge but it 's not easy to influence a religion like we just talked about but i 'll tell you what my people have done my groups are small there 's hundreds of us but we 've had huge right now women 's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time women are now allowed to pray in our church wide meetings and they never were before in the general conferences as of last week in a historic move three women were invited down to three leadership boards that oversee the entire church we 've seen perceptual shifts in the mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality we 've opened up regardless of being despised for more conservative women to step in and make real changes and the words women i never had that my daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that i never had that 's more equal we 've had an effect it wasn 't easy standing in those lines trying to get into those male meetings there we were told i 'm sorry this meeting is just for men and we had to step back and watch men escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day if we were a multinational corporation or a government and that had happened but we 're just a religion we 're all just part of religions we can 't keep looking at religion that way because it doesn 't only affect me it affects my daughter and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have what they can wear who they but we need to do it in a respectful way and we can do it through it 's time that half of the world 's population had voice and equality within our world 's religions churches synagogues mosques and shrines around the world i 'm working on my people what are you doing for yours"
