  "transcript": "these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world for example before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six meter tall tower composed of one thousand five hundred bricks in front of a live audience at the frac centre in france and several years ago they started to fly with ropes by tethering flying machines they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight skills learned include how to carry loads how to cope with disturbances and in general how to interact with the physical world today we want to show you some new projects that we 've been working on now for a system to function autonomously it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in back at our lab at eth zurich we often use external cameras to locate objects which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks there are no external cameras each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard to determine what its actions should be the only external commands are an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it which has huge advantages for takeoff landing and general there is no free lunch unfortunately one of the limitations with tail sitters is that they 're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts we 're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation the idea is for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself and through practice improve its performance over time when doing research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter now there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question helicopters for example are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts a propeller and a tail rudder we recently discovered that it could be done with just one even though it 's mechanically simple there 's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space i have to throw it just right given everybody watching me what we 're going to do instead is show you a video that we shot last night omnicopter with its eight propellers is an exercise in excess what can you do with all this surplus the thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric as a result it is ambivalent to orientation it can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers let 's take a look if flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives they will need to become extremely safe and reliable they behave like one electronics even a battery pack disabling one of its halves this last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms the large number of autonomous coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression we 've taken commercially available micro quadcopters each weighing less than a slice of bread by the way and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms because each unit knows where it is in space there is really no limit to their number one these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines that ultrasafe one over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on broadway the reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology and for folks like us it 's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is that it allows creative clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways the fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential thank you"
