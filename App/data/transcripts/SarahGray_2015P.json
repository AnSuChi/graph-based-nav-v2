  "transcript": "i was three months pregnant with twins when my husband ross and i went to my second sonogram and i knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect well nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face the doctor explained that one of our twins thomas had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly this means that his brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing appeared to be healthy as far as the doctor could tell and these twins were so there i was three months pregnant with two trimesters ahead of me and i had to find a way to and it felt like having a roommate but i stared down the barrel of that gun for so long that i saw a light at the end of the tunnel while there was nothing we could do to prevent she connected with our local organ procurement organization the washington regional transplant community explained to me that thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant i didn 't even know you could be rejected for that but they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research i started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery and just like the doctor said thomas was missing the top part of his skull and he slept in our arms we called who sent a van to our home and brought him to children 's national medical center hours later we got a call to say that the recovery was a success and thomas 's donations would be going to four different places his cord blood would go to duke university his liver would go to a cell therapy company called cytonet in durham which is part of harvard medical school and his retinas would go to the university of pennsylvania a few days later we had a funeral with our immediate family including baby callum but i did find myself wondering what 's happening now what are the researchers learning and was it even worthwhile to donate and we met about fifteen other grieving families who had donated their loved one 's organs for transplant and i was so excited i thought maybe i could write a so i was jealous i had transplant envy i guess i wrote a letter that started out dear i emailed it to the eye bank that arranged the donation the old dominion eye foundation and asked if they could send it to the right person and they 't guarantee a response but they wouldn 't be an obstacle and they would deliver it so next we talked on the phone and one of the first things she said to me was that she couldn 't possibly imagine how we felt and that she seemed to feel indebted to us so to be able to participate in your study gives thomas 's life a new layer of meaning so never feel guilty about using this tissue next she explained to me how rare it was she had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the national disease research interchange and it was thomas 's after we hung up i emailed her some pictures of thomas and callum and a few weeks later we received this t shirt in the mail a few months later ross callum and i piled in the car and we went for a road trip and that she hadn 't seen it from our perspective she also explained that thomas had a secret code name the same way henrietta lacks is called hela thomas was called and it was the shipping label that sent his retinas from dc to philadelphia this shipping label is like an heirloom to us now it 's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate also explained that she is using thomas 's retina and his rna then she took us to the freezer and she showed us the two samples that she still has that are still labeled res three hundred and sixty there 's two little ones left she said she saved it because she doesn 't know when she might get more after and and they also offered him an internship laughter so in closing i have two simple messages today one is that most of us probably don 't think about donating to research i know i i think i 'm a normal person and second is if you work with human tissue and you wonder about the donor and about the family write them a letter tell them you received it tell them what you 're working on and invite them to visit your lab because that visit may be even more gratifying for you than it is for them successful in arranging one of these visits please tell me about it the other part of my family 's story is that we ended up visiting all four facilities that received thomas 's donations and we met amazing people doing inspiring work the way i see it now is that thomas got into harvard and they need him in order to do their job and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself and i only hope that my life can be as relevant thank you"
