  "transcript": "the last twenty years i 've been designing puzzles and i 'm here today to give you a little tour starting from the very first puzzle i designed through what i 'm doing now i do toys the bulk of my work is in computer games i did puzzles for bejeweled sixth grade my teacher said oh let 's see that guy he likes to make stuff i 'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper for the i thought this was a great assignment and so here is what i came up with i start fiddling with it i came up with this letter this is a letter of the alphabet that 's been folded just once it 's not i created something new i was very excited because you know i 'd made crossword puzzles but that 's sort of like filling in somebody else 's matrix i got hooked i read martin gardner 's columns in scientific american went on and eventually decided to devote myself full time to that pause and say what do i mean by puzzle a puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve and has a right answer fun to solve as opposed to everyday problems which frankly are not very well designed puzzles you know they might have a solution it might take a long time nobody wrote down the rules clearly who life is not a very well written story so we have to hire writers to make movies well i take everyday problems and i make puzzles out of them and right answer of course there might be more than one right answer many puzzles have more than one but as opposed to a couple other forms of play toys and games by toy i mean something you play with that doesn 't have a particular goal you can create one out of legos you know you can do anything you want or competitive games like chess where well you 're not trying to solve but the goal really is to it 's a very small form like a joke a magic trick or a song very compact form they 're throwaways they 're for for amusement but at best they can reach for something more and create a memorable impression the progression of my career that you 'll see is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact so one thing i found early on when i started doing computer games is that i could create puzzles that will alter your perception i 'll show you how the artist m c escher exploited that in some of his wonderful prints here we have day and night here is what i did with figure and ground here we have figure in white and it 's all part of the same design it 's all and that turns into the title of my first book inversions these sorts of designs now go by the word ambigram i 'll here we have the numbers one through ten the each letter here is one of these digits not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense like pushing on what an ambigram can mean here 's the word mirror no it 's not the same upside down it 's the same this way and so i did this for him it 's sort of a visual canon so here we have penn and teller same upside down this appears in my those are fun to look at now how would you do it interactively for a while i was an interface designer and so i think a lot about interaction 's first of all simplify the vases illusion make the thing on the right now if you could pick up the black vase it would look like the figure on top you can 't do that physically but on a computer you can do it let 's switch over to the p c and here it the goal here is to take the pieces on the left and make them so they look like the shape and and you can pick it up i 'll just go one step further so here is here is a couple pieces move them together and now this is an active you can really get inside somebody 's perception and have them experience something it 's like the old maxim of you can tell somebody something and show them but if they do it they really learn it this is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides rubik 's cube i love this puzzle now this one is a little bit trickier you know what do you do here the first move is going to be what i didn 't come up with the original idea but this is another way i work as an inventor is to i came up with this this is railroad rush hour it 's the same basic game except i introduced a new piece a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically in the other game the cars can only move forward and back created a whole bunch of levels for it now and it includes exercises that show you not just how to solve these puzzles but how to extract the principles that will let you solve mathematical puzzles or problems in science other areas so i 'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles as well as just me creating them garry trudeau calls himself an i got interested in gene sequencing and i said well how on earth can you come up with a sequence of the base pairs in dna you sequence individual pieces and then you look for overlaps and you basically match them at the edges and i said this is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle and it has to be solvable in a magazine cut out the pieces and move them around so and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge there is only one solution it 's not that hard but it takes some persistence and when you 're done it makes this design which if you squint is the word helix that 's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content rather than the other way around which separations were mixed up to make those pictures gets you thinking about color finally what i 'm doing now website you can go visit i joined up with my wife amy jo kim she could easily be up here giving this is what 's going on in the games industry right now first you know for a long time computer games meant that 's who plays computer games well guess what that 's changing it was the game that really broke open what 's called casual games and the main players are over thirty five and are female and it 's a game you play with other people it 's very physical it looks nothing like a traditional game this is what 's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming now within that there is some interesting things happening oh no our parents are getting alzheimer 's we better do something turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of alzheimer 's so we got games like brain age age coming out for the nintendo ds huge hit a lot of people do sudoku in fact some doctors prescribe it and then there is social media and what 's happening on the internet everybody now considers themselves a creator and not just a viewer and what does this add up to it 's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle they 're part of your life they 're not necessarily a separate thing and they are both something that is good for you and they 're fun i 'm a and we have twenty four seconds each where is that i 'll play as fast as i can but if you can see it shout out the answer oh yeah that 's his hair you get a lot of figure ground problems yeah that one is easy okay so ahhh okay on to the next one okay so that 's the lens that that 's the corner of the whole thing yeah i 've played this image before but even when i make up my my own puzzles and you can put your own images in here and we have people all over the world doing that now"
