  "transcript": "and that is the neuroscience of sleep and what that truly ghastly awful sound does is stop the single most important if which means that if you live to ninety then and yet for most of us we don 't give sleep a second thought change your ideas and your thoughts we need to start by going back in time honey heavy dew of slumber any ideas who said that yes let me give you a few more nature 's soft nurse how have i frighted thee shakespeare again from i won 't say it the scottish play but if we jump forward four hundred years the tone about sleep changes somewhat this is from thomas edison from the beginning of the 20th century sleep is a criminal waste of time and a heritage from our cave days bang and if we also jump into the 1980s some of you may remember that margaret thatcher was reported to have said sleep is for wimps the infamous gordon gekko from we use thomas edison 's light bulb almost we 've treated it as an enemy an enemy we tolerate the need for sleep and at worst perhaps many of us think of sleep as an illness that needs some sort of a cure you don 't eat you it 's a complete waste of time right wrong this is donated by a social and they said they didn 't know what it was or indeed how to use it so sorry ok the point i 'm trying to make is that when you 're asleep this but is to some extent a network property if we flip the brain on its back i love this little bit of spinal cord here and right under there and what that structure does is interact with a whole raft of other the brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here with neurotransmitters that keep us so where have we got to we 've said that sleep is complicated and it takes of our life but what i haven 't explained is what sleep is about so why do we sleep and it won 't surprise any of you that of course as scientists we don 't have a consensus there are dozens of different ideas about why we sleep and i 'm going to outline three of those the first is sort of the restoration idea and it 's all the stuff we 've burned it goes back to aristotle so that 's what two thousand three hundred years ago it 's gone in and out of fashion it 's fashionable at the moment because what 's been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been shown to be turned on only during sleep so there 's good perhaps intuitive when you do the sums though it doesn 't really pan out if you compare an individual who has or stayed awake and hasn 't moved very much now that 's the equivalent of a hot dog bun bun now i would say that but the third idea i 'm quite attracted to which is brain processing and memory consolidation what we know is that if after you 've tried to learn a task and you it 's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it what 's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep in fact it 's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage sleeping at night those neural connections that are important those synaptic connections that are important are linked but sleep it 's not some sort of thing that we can i think that sleep was once it 's not even the critical thing to realize is that you don 't fly essentially you never get there huge sectors of society are sleep deprived and let 's look at our sleep o meter so we 're in the league it 's simply not enough if we think about other sectors of society the aged and it 's locked onto the same light dark cycle as the rest of us so when the poor old shift worker is going home to try and sleep during the day desperately tired body clock is saying wake up this is the time to be awake so the quality so who here has jet lag well thank you very much indeed for not falling asleep because that 's what your brain is craving one of the things that the brain does is indulge in it 's been estimated that thirty one percent of drivers will fall asleep at the wheel at least once in their life and in the us the statistics are pretty good one hundred thousand accidents on the freeway have been associated with tiredness loss of vigilance and falling asleep a hundred thousand a year it 's extraordinary and in the investigations that followed those you have increased impulsiveness and you have it 's so much so drugs stimulants caffeine represents the stimulant of choice across much of the western world nicotine of course you 're fueling the waking state with these what do we do about that when i 'm feeling completely wired well of course you then resort to alcohol now alcohol but what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn 't provide sleep a biological mimic for sleep it sedates you so it actually harms some of then you have a fifty percent likelihood of being obese what 's the connection here so there 's a link between tiredness and the metabolic predisposition for weight gain and one of the things of stress of course is loss of memory which is what i sort of just then had a little lapse of but it 's sustained stress associated with sleep loss that 's the problem and so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and there 's some very good studies increased levels of stress throw glucose into the circulation glucose becomes diabetes two stress increases cardiovascular disease so there 's a whole raft of things associated with sleep loss do you think on the whole i 'm getting enough sleep so a quick show of hands who feels that they 're getting enough sleep here oh well if you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning chances are you are this is slightly offensive sleep for dummies the first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can and also make it slightly cool very important actually reduce your amount of light exposure at least half an hour before you go to bed light increases levels of alertness and will delay sleep what 's the last thing that most of us do before we go to bed we in a massively lit bathroom turn off all of those things that are also going to excite the brain ideally not after lunch so seek out morning light that 's some facts what about some myths teenagers that 's an average some people need more some people need less and what you need to do is listen to your body do you need that much or do you need more simple as that old people need less sleep not true the sleep demands of the aged do not go down essentially sleep fragments and becomes less wealthy and wise well that 's wrong at so many different levels laughter there is no evidence that getting up early and going to bed early gives you more wealth at all there 's no difference in socioeconomic status in my experience only difference between morning people and evening people is that those people that get up in the morning early are just horribly smug so for the last few minutes what i want to do is change gears and talk about some really new breaking areas of neuroscience which is the association between mental health mental illness and sleep disruption we 've known for one hundred and thirty years that in severe mental illness there is always always sleep disruption it 's the antipsychotics causing the fact that for a hundred years previously so what 's going on several groups are studying conditions like depression schizophrenia and bipolar and what 's going on in terms of sleep disruption we have a big study which we published last year on schizophrenia and some so what 's going on and the really exciting news is that mental illness and genes that have been shown to be very important in the generation of normal when mutated when changed also predispose individuals to mental health problems and last year we published a study which showed that a gene that 's been linked to schizophrenia the first was that sleep disruption actually precedes certain types of mental illness and we 've shown that in those young individuals who are at high risk of developing bipolar disorder they already have a sleep abnormality prior to any clinical diagnosis of of bipolar the other bit of data was that sleep disruption may actually exacerbate make mental illness state my colleague dan freeman has used a range of agents which have stabilized sleep in these connections some really exciting things the second area is that if we can use sleep and sleep disruption as an early warning signal then we have the chance of going in if we know these individuals are vulnerable stabilize sleep in those individuals so let me just finish what i started by saying is take sleep seriously our attitudes toward sleep are so very different from a pre industrial age when we were almost wrapped in a duvet we used to understand intuitively the importance of sleep and this isn 't if you have good sleep it reduces your mood changes your stress your levels and we finished by saying thank you"
