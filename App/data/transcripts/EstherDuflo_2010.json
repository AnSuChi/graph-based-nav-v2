  "transcript": "maybe a sobering thought and i suspect many of you gave something to the people of haiti this year and there is something else i believe in the back of your mind you also know that but somehow it doesn 't happen with the same well here is a thought experiment for you do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money that we know how to eradicate poverty we just need to do more or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help dependence etc or maybe you look at the past and see has it done any good and worst of all we will never know and the gdp in africa is not making much progress we don 't know what the counterfactual is there 's only one africa or do you focus on your everyday life and let the if we don 't know whether we are doing any good sometimes the patient but they are not that small that 's the cheapest way to save a child 's life and yet every year at least twenty five million children do not get the immunization they should get so this is what you call a last mile problem and here 's another question but some people come to you and say you have your millions how about bed nets bed nets are very ten dollars you can manufacture and ship an insecticide treated bed net and you can teach someone to use them and not only do they protect the people who sleep under them but they have these great contagion benefits societies should be willing to go out and subsidize the net give them for free or for that matter pay people to use them because of those contagion benefits maybe as fishing nets and a third question education maybe that 's the solution maybe we should send kids to school but how do you do that and in the 20th century randomized controlled trials have revolutionized medicine by allowing us to distinguish between drugs that work and drugs that don 't work you can take the guesswork out of by knowing what works what doesn 't work and why but there are places like that subcenters and crowded hospitals so what is the problem and maybe when you get there what you find is this the subcenter is closed you have to come back and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do you will always tend to postpone and postpone and eventually it gets too late well then that 's much easier because a we can make it easy and b we can maybe give people a reason to act today rather than wait till tomorrow so what we did is we did a randomized controlled trial in one hundred and thirty four villages in udaipur districts and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization it 's never going to convince anybody to do something that they don 't want to do everything is the same that 's the beauty of randomization that 's a good improvement add the lentils and you reach to thirty eight percent so here you 've got your answer make it easy and give a kilo of lentils you multiply immunization rate the cost per immunization ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don 't so the answer hinges on the answer to three simple questions one is it might destroy markets to distribute free bed and many experiments have been run and they all have the same results so i 'm just going to talk to you about one and this one that was in kenya they went around and distributed to people vouchers discount vouchers and some people get one hundred percent discount and some people get twenty percent discounts and some people get fifty percent discount etc and now we can see what happens the coverage rate really falls down a lot so even with partial subsidy three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net and now you only have twenty percent of the people with second thing is how about the use in the long term people who got the free bed nets and people who got the free one were actually more likely to purchase the second one than people who didn 't get a free one maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit so that 's for bed nets so you will think that 's great you know how to immunize kids you know how to give bed nets but what politicians need is a range of options they need to know out of so suppose your goal is to get kids into school there are so what 's the best well at some level we think all of these things should work consider for example transporting goods and with the same horseman and the same horse you could so should they have continued in technology we spend so much time experimenting fine tuning getting the absolute cheapest way to do something so why aren 't we doing that with social policy how many extra years of education do you get for your hundred dollars now i school uniforms you get between one and three extra years of education that 's very cheap to do so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that you get forty extra years of education and in places where there are worms and for every hundred dollars you get almost thirty extra years of education and yet these are the programs that work and i cut it scientific robust answers so let 's go back to haiti for a moment so that 's about ten thousand dollars per death so why is that well i think what part of the problem is that in and they 'll helicopter things out and in and the problem of poverty is not like that and that 's very frustrating deworm children so we cannot eradicate poverty just yet but we can get started and maybe we get started small with things that we know are effective here and yet when the young global leader in davos showed the numbers i gave you they started deworm the world and thanks to deworm the world but there is no other way these economics i 'm proposing it 's like 20th century medicine it 's a slow deliberative process and now maybe we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning it really prompted a change for the better i believe we can and i hope we will thank you"
