  "transcript": "tell you about they deal with what i care about most is making space and that 's what i 've called this talk making space space that exists within us and without us so when i was a child i don 't know how many of you grew up in the ' 50s but i was sent upstairs for an enforced rest i mean after lunch you 're you know you 're six and you want to small and light and i had to lie there it was ridiculous but anyway for some reason i promised myself that i wasn 't going to move that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do dark claustrophobic but it was really weird like after this went on for days weeks that space would get bigger and darker and cooler until i really looked forward to that half an hour and i really looked forward to going to that place of darkness do if we do something completely different can we all just close our eyes for a minute now this isn 't going to be freaky it isn 't some cultic thing it 's just so close your eyes for a minute the subjective collective space of the darkness of the body i think of this as the place of imagination it is objectless there are no things in it it is dimensionless it is limitless it is that 's the space that i think sculpture which is a bit of a paradox sculpture that is about making material propositions but i think that 's the space that sculpture can connect us with you wake up and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag you can see this is a dry lake bed directly with place this was a wonderful place it was it was a place where you could imagine that you were the the first person to be there it was a place where i picked up a threw it as far as i was i then cleared all the stones within that radius and made a a pile and here is doesn 't look very different from when he when he started laughter what 's all the fuss about in fact chris was worried and said look don 't show them that slide because they 're just going to think you 're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn 't do much but the fact is this is evidence of a living body on other bodies rocks that have been the subject of this is a place in a way that i just would like you to in a way look at differently because of this event that has happened in it a human event and in general it just asks us to look again the world that we have been sharing with each other the technological world to look again at the elemental world the darkness of the body subjective space that each of us lives in so here is a this is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time can we map but in complete reversal of in a way the most traditional greek idea of pointing in the old days they used to take a lump of what aristotle the thing that makes things visible but here we 're working from the other side or can we do it an exclusive membrane this is a lead case made around but it 's now void this is a work called learning to see it 's well we could call it night dark matter another version of a human space in space at large but i don 't know if you can see the eyes are indicated they 're closed it 's called learning to see because it 's about an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that and talk about the body or the standing of a statue release it allow it to be an energy field a space in space that talks about human human life between becoming an entropy as a sort of concentration of attention a human place of possibility in space at large is there another way dark matter now placed if minds live in bodies if bodies live in clothes and then in rooms and then in buildings and then in cities do they also have a final skin and is that a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of as it is lived as as i am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this space time that we are sharing can we use at it were the memory of a body firsthand experience of elemental time human time tested against the time of the tides in which these memories of multiplied as in the time of placed over three square miles but maybe more importantly this is just looking north from the center of the installation they create a field a field that involves living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation a relation with each other the horizon just moving this is a work called room for the great australian desert it 's in an undefined location and i 've never published where it is it 's an object for the now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy a crouching body there 's a hole concrete this is just simply asking again as if we had arrived for the first time what is the relationship of the human project to time and taking that idiom of as it were the darkness of the body transferred to architecture can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor and use its systolic diastolic smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through this is a work of some proportion and some weight that makes the body into a city an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected and that allow certain visual access at certain places the last work that i just wanted to share with you is blind light which is perhaps using light and water vapor as my materials here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure with a cloud both to yourselves and to others if you hold your hand out in front of you you can 't see it if you look down you are now consciousness without an object freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory but this is a space that is actually filled with people disembodied voices and out of that ambient when people come close to your own they are representations in which the viewers have become the viewed"
