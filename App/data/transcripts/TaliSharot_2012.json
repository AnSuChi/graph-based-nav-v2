  "transcript": "'m going to talk to you about optimism and eighty percent of us have it it 's our tendency to overestimate our likelihood of experiencing good events in our in short we 're more optimistic than realistic but we are oblivious to the fact that means that out of five married couples two will end up splitting their assets but when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce they estimate it at zero percent but they are more likely to remarry in the words of samuel johnson remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience this by the way is my because he is in fact uniquely talented and this is a really important point because we 're optimistic about ourselves we 're optimistic about our kids but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so and i want you to think for each of these abilities where you stand relative to the rest of the population the first one is getting along well with others who here believes they 're at the bottom twenty five percent who believes they 're at the top twenty five percent how interesting are you how attractive are you so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities now this is statistically impossible we can 't all be better than everyone else but if we believe we 're better than the other guy well that means that we 're more likely to get that promotion and it 's a global phenomenon but the question is is it good for us so some people say no some people say the secret to happiness is low expectations i think the logic goes something like this so it 's a very good theory because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month the psychologists margaret marshall and john brown studied students with high and low expectations and they found that when people with high expectations succeed they attribute that success to their own traits therefore i got an a therefore i 'll get an a again and again in the future next time they will do better the behavioral economist then he said but to get a kiss in three days they were willing to pay extra in order to wait no one wants an aging celebrity but three days seemed to be so why is that well that 's three days of jittery anticipation the thrill it 's a really curious fact because friday is a day of work and sunday is a day of pleasure so you 'd assume that people will we know that because when you ask people about their ultimate so optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future more strolls in the park and that anticipation enhances their wellbeing we would all be slightly depressed people with they don 't have a bias when they look into the future they 're actually more realistic than healthy individuals but it also and that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy it leads to success and maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health if we expect the future to be bright as an neuroscientist this was especially confusing because according to all the theories out when your expectations are not met you should alter them but this is not what we find we asked people to come into our lab in order to try and figure out what was going on so cancer for example is about thirty percent and then we asked them again how likely are you to suffer from cancer and indeed they did but mostly when the information we gave them was better than what they the average likelihood is only thirty percent but if someone started off saying my average likelihood of suffering from cancer is bad news the average likelihood is about thirty percent the next time around they would say yep still think it 's about eleven percent so it 's not that they didn 't learn at all they did and it 's not that they didn 't remember the numbers that we gave them but they didn 't think that those numbers were related to them what i wanted to know we think oh my house is definitely going to double in price and using a method called we were able to identify regions in the brain that were responding to positive information so if someone said my likelihood of suffering from cancer is fifty percent and we said hey good news average likelihood is thirty percent and it didn 't matter if you 're an extreme a mild optimist or slightly pessimistic everyone 's left inferior frontal gyrus was functioning perfectly well whether you 're barack obama or woody allen the more optimistic you were the less likely this region was to respond to unexpected negative information so we wanted to know could we change this could we alter people 's optimism bias by interfering with the brain activity in these regions and there 's a way for us to do that after that everything goes back to normal i assure you so let 's see what happens first of all i 'm going to show you the average amount of bias that we see so if i was to we made people more biased in the way that they process information we were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep rooted bias in we stopped and we asked ourselves well i 've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life ' we didn 't think the fire was going to do that ' even when all of the available information was there to make safe decisions this captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias to try to explain to the firefighters why they think the way they do to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic so unrealistic optimism the british government for example my friend who 's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget and by the way when i asked him about his own likelihood of divorce he said he was quite sure it was zero percent so what we would really like to do and i believe there 's a way for us to do that but the good news is that becoming and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism but at the same time remain hopeful i think this cartoon portrays it nicely because if you 're one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly you certainly never will but if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps but if you 're an optimistic penguin who believes they can fly but then adjusts a parachute to your back even if you 're just a penguin thank you"
