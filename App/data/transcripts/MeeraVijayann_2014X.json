  "transcript": "so i want to begin with an everyday story what is it really like to be a young woman in india now i 've spent the last when i was seven a private tutor who used to come home to teach me mathematics molested me he would put his hand up my skirt he put his hand up skirt and told me he knew how to make me feel good at seventeen a boy from my high school circulated an email detailing all the sexually aggressive things he could do to me because i didn 't pay attention to him i helped a friend whose parents had forcefully married her to an older man escape an abusive marriage at twenty one when my friend and i were walking down the road one afternoon a man pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of us we called people for help and nobody came so throughout my life i 've seen women and they seldom talk about it so in simple words life in india is not easy but today i 'm not going to talk to you about this fear i 'm going to talk to you about an interesting path of learning that this fear took me on boarded a bus in delhi with her male friend there were six men on the bus young men who you might encounter every day and the chilling account of what followed was played over and over again in the indian and international media bitten and left to die her friend was gagged attacked and knocked unconscious she died on the 29th of december and at a time when most of us here were preparing to welcome the new year india plunged into darkness for the first time in our history men and women in indian cities woke up to the horrific truth about the true state of women in the country but really what do you do right some write blogs some ignore it some join protests i did all of it in fact that was what everyone was doing two years ago so the media was filled with stories about all the horrific deeds that indian men are capable of they were compared to animals sexually repressed beasts in fact so alien and unthinkable was this event in an indian mind that the response from the indian media public and politicians proved one point no one knew what to do and no one wanted to be responsible for it and the third one was actually the defendants when the girl was fighting for her life and she passed away so as a writer and gender activist i have written extensively on women but this time i realized it was different because a part of me realized i was a part of that young woman too and i decided i wanted to change this so i logged the blog was shared widely comments and thoughts poured in from across the world in that moment a few things occurred to me one technology was always at hand for many young women like me so in the months that followed i covered a trail of events in bangalore which had no space in the mainstream news i gathered with over one hundred others when groups of young men came forward to wear skirts to prove that clothing does not invite rape when i reported about these i attended the town hall march when students held up signs saying kill them hang them you wouldn 't do this to your mothers or sisters the reactions confused me but this one comment kind of describes but i was soon to learn that this was not all i found myself in an unfamiliar situation i clicked on the it led me back to the story you never wanted to hear she wrote there is no way to prepare for the eyes the eyes that every day stared such entitlement at my body with no change of expression whether i met their gaze or not walking to the fruit seller 's or the tailor 's i got stares so sharp that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece now late that evening the it was on and i found myself witnessing a very similar thing so that night as i sat wondering how i should respond i found myself filled with doubt you see as a writer i approached this issue as an observer as an indian i felt embarrassment and disbelief but as a citizen journalist i mean here she was a young woman you see no one ever tells you that true empowerment comes from giving yourself the permission to think and act empowerment is often made to sound as if it 's an ideal it 's a wonderful outcome when we talk about empowerment we often talk about giving people access to materials but the thing is empowerment is an emotion it 's a feeling the first step to empowerment and for women everywhere no matter who we are or where we come from that is the most difficult step we fear the sound of our own voice for it means admission but it is this that gives us the power to change our environment i feared to judge because i didn 't know what it would be if i didn 't support the same view as this girl i didn 't know what it would mean for me if i was challenging someone so after a lot of thought and i also i was invited to talk on air with her and but yet i felt so close to and the university that michaela belonged to gave her the assistance she needed and for the first the time i felt i wasn 't alone you see if there 's anything that i 've learned as an active citizen journalist over the past few years it is our dire lack as a society to actively find avenues where our voices can be heard we don 't realize that when when we are standing up we are not just standing up as individuals but the truth women deny themselves these rights in a recent survey in india ninety five percent of the women who work in i t aviation hospitality and call centers said they didn 't feel safe returning home alone after work in the late hours or in the evening in bangalore where i come from this number is eighty five percent if anything is to go by the recent gang rapes in badaun and acid attacks in odisha and aligarh are supposed to go by we need to act really soon but we need to start pursuing and trying to identify mediums to participate in our system and not just pursue the media blindly and this is a result of that courage there is a sixfold increase in women reporting harassment and the government passed the criminal law act in two thousand and thirteen to protect women against sexual assault as i end this talk i just want to say but let us speak up let us fight the shame and talk about it it could be a platform a community your loved one whoever or but let us speak up the truth is the end to this problem begins with us thank you"
