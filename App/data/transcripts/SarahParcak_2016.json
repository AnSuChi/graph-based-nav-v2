  "transcript": "i 'm most often asked what my favorite discovery is the answer 's easy my husband greg it was my first lesson in finding unexpected this began an incredible archaeological partnership i thought if i was going to ask greg to spend the rest of this life with me then i should ask him in front of two people who had pledged to be together for eternity they are powerful reminders that our common humanity has not changed the thrill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love because ancient history is the most seductive mistress imaginable many archaeologists have devoted their lives to unraveling the mysteries of the past under hot suns and arctic winds some discover all worship at the temple of possibility that one discovery might change history dating to four thousand two hundred years ago in a cemetery that 's a picture of me i 'm just in my bliss i discovered a human thumbprint left by whoever made the vessel for a moment time stood still i didn 't know where i was it was because at that moment i realized when we dig we 're digging for people never are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past i can 't tell you how many times i 've i feel like the luckiest person in the world they 're a monument to our human brilliance and everything that is possible many cannot process their brilliance as human they think aliens built them this is ridiculous all you need to do is get up close and personal and see the hidden hand of man in the chisel marks left by the tools that built them it is not the pyramids that stand the test of time it is human ingenuity that is our shared human brilliance history i get to read about mother in law jokes from mesopotamia from three thousand five hundred years ago get to hear about neighbors cursing each other from four thousand six hundred years ago in egypt and my absolute favorite from three thousand three hundred years ago in luxor an inscription that describes schoolboys who cut class to go drinking kids these days i get to see the most incredible architecture see stunning sculptures i mean this is basically a selfie in stone we 've been posting on walls and obsessing about cats cultural memory preservers and the spokespeople for the billions of people and the thousands of cultures that came before us imagination and a leap of faith are the trifecta we use to raise the dead archaeologists have made incredible discoveries new human ancestors from south africa and this from a series of medical implements found from blackbeard 's ship from one thousand seven hundred and eighteen what you 're looking at is a medical tool used to treat syphilis i believe that the most important thing we do as archaeologists is acknowledge that past people existed and lived lives worth learning about can you even imagine what the world would be like today if we acknowledged all human beings in this way let 's have a look from space again you can 't really see much what you 're this means that you can zoom in from four hundred miles in space and see your tablets how do i know about this let me repeat that i am a space archaeologist this means i use satellite images and process them using algorithms and look at subtle differences in the light spectrum that indicate buried things under the ground that i get to go excavate and survey so it 's a real job so let 's have a look keep your eye on the red rectangle when we process the image using algorithms think like a space based cat scan this is what you see this rectilinear form is an ancient tomb that is previously unknown and unexcavated and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years i believe we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what 's left to discover we 've excavated less than when you add to that the thousands of other sites my team and i have discovered what we thought we knew pales i believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites left to find discovering them will do nothing less than unlock the full potential of our existence but we have a challenge we 've seen horrible headlines of incredible destruction going on to archaeological sites and massive looting by people like isil isil has destroyed temples at palmyra who blows up a temple they 've destroyed the tomb of jonah and knowing isil 's desire to destroy modern human lives it 's a natural extension for them to destroy cultural identity as well countless invading armies have done the same this means that any object purchased on the market today from the middle east could potentially be funding terrorism it 's as if a puzzle already missing ninety percent of it pieces has had the rest we know that there are two kinds of looting going on looting by criminal elements like isil and then more local looting by those that are desperate for money i blame the middlemen the unethical traffickers and an international art market that exploits often ambiguous or completely nonexistent laws we know looting is going on on a global scale and it 's increasing but presently we don 't have any tools to stop it this is beginning to change my team and i have just completed a study looking at looting in egypt we looked at we found evidence of looting and site destruction at two hundred and sixty seven sites and mapped over two hundred thousand looting pits it and putting that data together you can see the looting pits marked here at one site the looting got bad from two thousand and nine two thousand and eleven two thousand and twelve hundreds and hundreds of pits putting all the data together what we found is that contrary to popular opinion we 've shown with big data that looting is fundamentally an economic if we do nothing to stop the problem i am just back from the where i co led a joint mission with egypt 's ministry of antiquities at a site called lisht this site dates to the middle kingdom of egypt between two thousand and one thousand seven hundred and fifty bc the middle kingdom was ancient egypt 's renaissance period after a time of intense internal strife and environmental challenges egypt rebounded with an now at this site we had already mapped countless looting pits lisht is a royal site there would have been thousands of people buried there who lived and worked at the court of pharaoh you can see this before and after you see dozens of this is in south lisht before and after multiply that times over a thousand that 's what was taken but i didn 't think we 'd find anything i thought the looters had stolen everything and even the titles of the tomb owner he had titles like overseer of the army overseer of the treasury i began to have hope having their name last for eternity was their goal this is the we had restored someone 's name from three thousand nine hundred years ago working together with my egyptian colleagues every day on site we worked together with seventy egyptians as colleagues and friends in the face of so much hatred and ignorance against those in the middle east every moment on site felt like a protest for peace your shared mission of archaeological discovery erases all superficial differences what i learned this season is that archaeology isn 't about what you find it 's about what you can prove but a shared entry in the book of life this is omer farrouk my brother omer 's called guft guftis are part of a celebrated tradition in egyptology they help with i simply couldn 't do work without him completely randomly that we were born in the same year the same month and the same day i knew then we 'd always work together but in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained so just before my first dig in egypt my mentor the very famous egyptologist professor william kelly simpson called me into his office someday you will do this for someone else my ted prize wish is partial payback plus interest for a great human being 's generosity and kindness so my wish i wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites around the world by creating a which contains clues to humankind 's collective resilience and creativity thank you so how are we going to do this we are going to build with the ted prize money crowdsource citizen science platform to allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering archaeological sites there are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world it is my dream to engage the world with helping to find sites and protect them note that this particular username is already taken you 'll take a tutorial and you 'll start work i want to note at the outset that in no way will be sharing gps data or mapping data for sites we want to treat them like human patient data and not reveal their locations you 'll then be dealt a card from a deck twenty x twenty meters or thirty x thirty meters and you 'll be looking for features my team and i large amounts of satellite data using algorithms in order for you to find things so you 'll be doing really good science you 'll then be starting to look what do you see do you see a temple do you see a tomb do you see a pyramid do you see any potential site damage or site looting you 'll then begin to mark what 's there and off to the side are always going to be rich examples of exactly what you 're seeing to help but it 's not just going to stop there all the archaeologists with whom we share your discoveries will take you with them as they begin to excavate them google plus and social archaeology was for the rich now it 's primarily for academics and allow anyone to participate howard carter discovered the tomb of king tut who is the next howard carter by creating this platform we will find the millions of places occupied by the billions of people that came before us if we want to answer the big questions about who we are but in the cities and villages of those that came before us if we want to learn about the past it 's time we inverted the pyramids acknowledging that the past is worth saving means so much more it means that we 're worth saving and the greatest story ever told but the only way we 're going to be able to write it is if we do it together come with me"
