  "transcript": "half a century of trying to help prevent wars there 's one question that never leaves me how do we deal with extreme violence without using when you 're faced with brutality whether it 's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence or on the streets of syria today facing tanks and shrapnel what 's the most effective thing to do fight back give in use more force this how do i deal with a bully i remember glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room as soviet tanks and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down and my mother came up and said what on earth are you doing and i said i 'm going to budapest and she said what on earth for and i said kids are getting killed there there 's something terrible happening and she said don 't be so silly and she got it she said okay i see it 's serious much too young to help you need training i 'll help you but just unpack your suitcase and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s i wanted to understand how violence how oppression works and what i 've discovered since is this bullies use violence in three ways they use political violence to intimidate physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine nelson mandela went to jail believing in violence and twenty seven years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills the incredible skills that they needed and they did it in a total devotion to non violence they realized that using force against does work over time i 've collected about a half dozen methods that do work of course there are many more that do work and that are effective and the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here inside me it 's my my attitude to oppression that i 've got control over and that i can do something about and what i need to develop is where my formidable points are where my weaker points are when do i give not the only one it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power and my heroine here like satish 's is aung san suu kyi in burma she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun put her hand on it and lower it and no one got killed so that 's what the mastery of fear can do not only faced with i have a little mantra my fear grows fat on the energy i feed it and if it grows very big it probably happens so when something you 've been worrying about wakes you up i see a lot of people and for an hour you toss and turn it gets worse and worse and by four o 'clock you 're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big the only thing to do is to get up make a cup of tea and sit down you 're the adult the fear is the child and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants what it needs how can this be made and you make a plan now we 're going back to sleep half past seven we 're getting up and that 's what we 're going to do a m episodes on sunday paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you sat down with it did it all and i 'm here that 's fear what about anger wherever there is but anger as an engine in an engine is powerful if we can put our anger inside inside an engine it can drive us forward it can get us through the dreadful moments and i learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to totally ineffective in order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger it 's okay to be angry with the the thing the nuclear weapons in this case but it is hopeless to be angry with the and it brings me to the crux of what 's going on or what i perceive as going on in the world today which is that last century was top down power it was still governments telling people what to do this century there 's a shift it it 's people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away to and peace direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do they know best what to do so peace direct gets behind them to do that and the kind of thing they 're doing is resettling refugees even liberating child and what they 've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane but it 's less effective than using methods that connect people with people that rebuild and i think that the u s military is finally beginning to get this up to now their policy and if civilians get in the way that 's written as and this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of afghanistan when people are so disgusted by for example the burning of the koran and i think signs that it is beginning to change the british military have always been much better at this but there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from and that 's a brilliant and he was leading his men down the streets of najaf in iraq actually and suddenly people were and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his and these and complete silence fell and after about two minutes everybody moved aside and went home now that to me is wisdom in action in the moment that 's what he did and it 's happening everywhere now you don 't believe me have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last thirty years east germany and this hasn 't just happened a lot of it is due to a book written by an 80 year old man in boston gene sharp he wrote a book called from dictatorship to democracy the world and it 's being used by young people and older people everywhere so this is what gives me hope not just hope this is what makes me feel very positive right now beings are getting it we 're doable methodologies to answer my question how do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug we 're using the kind of skills that i 've outlined courage commitment to active have to believe in it i see evidence everywhere of how it works and ordinary people can do what aung san suu kyi and ghandi and mandela did we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known and we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as and thank you"
