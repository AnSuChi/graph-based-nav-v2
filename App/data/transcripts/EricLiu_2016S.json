  "transcript": "perhaps you 've even said them how else would more than half of federal tax breaks flow up to the wealthiest five percent of americans and our choices indeed are often terrible for many people across the political in any year you can look up and down the ballot and find plenty to be uninspired about today i want to talk about how we can do that and why when it was much more than just a grim duty to show up at the polls that time is called most of american history from the revolution to the civil rights era the united states had a vibrant robustly participatory and raucous culture of voting it was street theater open air debates fasting and feasting and toasting parades during the 19th century immigrants and urban political machines helped fuel this culture of voting that culture grew during reconstruction when new african american voters new african american citizens began to exercise their power they celebrated in jubilee parades that connected emancipation with their newfound right to vote a few decades later the suffragettes brought a marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise and the civil rights movement which sought to redeem the promise of equal citizenship that had been betrayed by jim crow put voting right at the center and they knew that spectacle and the performance of power is key to actually claiming power but it 's been over a half century since selma and the voting rights act and in the decades since this face to face culture of voting it 's been killed by television and then the internet and while it 's nice to share political memes it 's what the sociologist sherry turkle calls being alone together what we need today is an electoral culture that is about being together together in person in loud and passionate ways so that instead of being voting can feel more like join the club or better yet join the party imagine if we had in local places but nationwide outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked and praised in broad satirical style soapbox speeches by citizens streets filled with political art and handmade posters and murals battle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep their candidates now all of this may sound a little bit 18th century to you but in fact it doesn 't have to be any more which is to say vibrantly contemporary in india elections are colorful communal affairs in brazil election day is a in taiwan and hong kong there is a spectacle here in america who has time for this and i would tell you that the average american watches five hours of television a day you might ask who has the motivation and i 'll tell you any citizen who wants to be seen and heard not as a prop not as a talking point but as a participant as a creator simply by making it happen that 's why a group of colleagues and i launched a new project called the joy of voting in four cities across the united states akron ohio and wichita kansas we 've gathered together artists and activists educators political folks neighbors everyday citizens to come together and create projects that can foster in akron it means political plays being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood in philadelphia it 's a voting themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town it 's and they are changing people let me tell you about a couple of them in miami we 've commissioned and artist a young artist named atomico to create some vivid and vibrant images for a new series of i voted the thing is atomico had never voted he wasn 't even registered he also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics he got himself registered and then he got educated about the upcoming primary election and on election day he in akron a theater company called the wandering aesthetics has been putting on these pickup truck plays and to do so they put out an open call to the public asking for speeches monologues dialogues poems snippets of anything that could be read aloud and woven into a performance they got dozens of submissions one of them was a poem by nine students in an esl class all of them hispanic migrant workers from nearby hartville ohio i it 's called the joy of voting i would like to vote for the first time because things are changing for hispanics i used to be afraid of ghosts now i am afraid of people there 's more violence and racism voting can change this it 's just a wall the wall of shame it 's very important to vote so we can break down this wall of shame i have passion in my heart voting gives me a voice and power i can stand up and do something the and it isn 't just our organization 's work immigrants young people veterans people of all different backgrounds are coming together to create this kind of passionate in red and blue states in urban and rural communities people of every political background because remember all citizenship is local when politics becomes just a presidential but when politics is about us and our neighbors and other people in our community coming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination then we begin to remember that this stuff matters we begin to remember that this is the stuff of self government there 's one way to answer this question voting matters because it is a it feeds the spirit when we vote even if it is in anger we are part of a collective creative leap of faith voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had it 's no accident that democracy and theater emerged around the same time in ancient athens both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined and can be reimagined this moment right now think about the meaning of imagination is so fundamentally important and our ability to take that spirit and to take that sense that there is something greater out there is not just a matter of technical expertise it 's not just a matter of making the time or having but let me give you an answer to this question why bother that is maybe a little less spiritual and a bit more pointed because there is no such thing as not voting not voting is voting for everything that you may detest and oppose not voting can be dressed up as an act of principled passive but in fact not voting is actively handing power over to those whose interests are counter to your own and those who would be very glad to take advantage of your absence not voting is for suckers imagine where this country would be if all the folks who in two thousand and ten created the tea party had decided that you know politics is too messy voting is too complicated there is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything they didn 't preemptively silence themselves they showed up and in the course of showing up they changed american politics imagine if all of the followers of donald trump and bernie sanders had decided not to upend the political status quo and blow apart the frame of the previously possible in american politics they did that by voting we live in a time right now divided often very dark where across the left and the right there 's a lot of talk of revolution and the need for revolution to disrupt everyday democracy well here 's the thing everyday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution young voters latino voters all showed up at less than fifty percent we get revolution the policy priorities of this country change dramatically and every level of government becomes radically more responsive to all the people but at the same we have to make joy so yes let 's have that revolution a revolution of spirit of ideas of policy and participation a revolution against cynicism a revolution against the self fulfilling sense of powerlessness thank you very much"
