  "transcript": "i wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence i 'm going to start way back in the third grade i remember one day seeing what he was doing leaned over and said to him that 's terrible that doesn 't look anything like a horse and he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the never saw brian do a project like that and i wonder how often that happens you know it seems like when i tell that story of brian to my class a lot of them want to come up after class and tell me about their similar experience how a teacher shut them down or how a student was particularly cruel to them and then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative at that point and i see that and it moves in and becomes more ingrained even by the time you get to adult life so we see a lot of this when we have a workshop or when we have clients in to work with us side by side and eventually executives whip out their blackberrys and they 're just so uncomfortable when we track them down and ask them what 's going on they say something like i 'm just not the creative type but we know that 's not true if they stick with the process and i had a major breakthrough when but if you go to wikipedia it says that he 's the fourth most important psychologist in history somebody and bandura and he still works at stanford and he 's just a lovely guy so i went to see him because he 's just worked on phobias for a long time which i 'm very interested in he had developed this this way this kind of methodology that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time like in four hours he had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias and we talked about snakes we talked about snakes and fear of snakes and it was really enjoyable really interesting he told me that he 'd invite the test subject in and he 'd say you know there 's a snake in the next room and we 're going to go in there to which he reported most of them replied hell no i 'm not going in there certainly if there 's a snake in there but bandura has a so he 'd take people to this two way mirror looking into the room where the snake was he 'd move and they 'd be looking in there and he 'd get them comfortable with that and then many more steps later baby steps they 'd be in the room they 'd have a leather glove like a welder 's and when they touched the snake these people who had lifelong fears of snakes bandura calls this these people who went through the process and touched the snake ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives they persevered longer and they were more resilient in the face of failure they just gained a new confidence the sense that you can change the world because i realized that this famous scientist had documented and scientifically validated something that we 've seen happen for the last thirty years that we could take people who had the fear that they weren 't creative and they surprise themselves that transformation is amazing we see it at the d school all the time people from all different kinds of disciplines and they come in and they go through the process our process they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently and they 're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around thinking of themselves as a creative person so i thought one of the things i 'd do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like to me that journey looks like doug dietz doug dietz is a technical person he designs large medical imaging equipment when he saw a young family and that little girl was crying and was terrified and doug was really disappointed to learn that nearly eighty percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital had to be sedated in order to deal with his mri machine and this was really disappointing to doug because before this time he was proud of what he did but it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids about that he was learning about our process about design thinking about empathy he would redesign and this is what he came up with he turned it into an adventure for the he painted the walls and he painted the machine and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids like children 's museum people but be very still because we don 't want the pirates to find you and the results were super dramatic from something like eighty percent of the kids needing to be sedated to something like ten percent of the kids needing needing to be sedated and the hospital and ge were happy too because you didn 't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time and they could put more kids through the machine in a day and when the little girl came out of her scan she ran up to her mother and said mommy can we come back tomorrow laughter and so i 've heard doug tell the story many times of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it but i 've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye doug 's story takes place in a hospital i know a thing or two about hospitals i felt a lump on the side of my neck it was my turn in the mri machine so while you 're sitting around the other patients in your pajamas and everybody 's pale and thin you but you think about other things i thought a lot about what was i put on earth to do i was lucky because i had lots of options we 'd been working in health and wellness and the developing world so there were lots of projects that i could work on but then i decided and committed at this point to the thing i most wanted to do which was to help as many people as possible regain the creative confidence they lost along their way i survived just so you know i really believe that when people gain this confidence and we see it all the time at the d school and at ideo that they actually start working on the things that are really important in their lives we see people quit what they 're doing and go in new directions we see them and they just make better decisions i know at ted you 're supposed to have a so i hope you 'll join me on my quest you as kind of thought leaders it would be really great if you didn 't let people divide the world into the creatives and the non creatives like it 's some god given thing and to have people realize that they 're naturally creative and that those natural people should let their thank you"
