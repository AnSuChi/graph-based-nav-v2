we 're searching we 're finding amazing things i want to tell you about an amazing thing here on earth and that is that every minute four hundred pounds of hydrogen and almost seven pounds of helium escape from earth into space and this is gas so hydrogen helium and many other things make up what 's known as the earth 's atmosphere it protects our planet from too many impacts from meteorites and the like and it 's such an amazing that the fact that it 's disappearing should frighten you at least a little bit so this process is something that i study so atmospheric escape is not specific to planet earth it 's part of what it means to be a planet if you ask me because planets not just here on earth but and the way it happens actually tells us so for those of you who are stressed by this picture i will add somebody for you pluto is a planet in my mind in the same way that planets around other stars that we can 't see are also planets so fundamental characteristics of planets include the fact that they are bodies that are bound together by gravity so it 's a lot of material just stuck together and that 's the star the reason that fundamentally stars drive atmospheric escape from planets is because stars offer planets particles and light and heat or you look at this picture of lanterns in thailand at a festival it can escape into space and so this is what 's actually causing atmospheric escape here on earth and also on other planets that interplay between heating from the star and overcoming the force of gravity but what does that look like well even in the ' 80s so these two images of the earth show you what that glow of escaping hydrogen and you can also see other features like oxygen and nitrogen in that white glimmer in the circle showing you the auroras and also some wisps around the tropics so these are pictures that conclusively show us that our atmosphere isn 't just tightly bound to us here on earth but it 's actually reaching out far into space and at an alarming rate i might add but the earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape so it has much less gravity with which to hold on to its atmosphere you see craters indicating that it didn 't have an atmosphere that could stop those impacts also we see that it 's the red planet and atmospheric escape plays a role in mars being red that 's because we think mars used to have a wetter past and when water had enough energy it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen it escaped into space and the oxygen that was left oxidized or rusted the ground making that that familiar rusty red color that we see so it 's fine to look at pictures of mars and say that atmospheric escape probably happened but nasa has a probe that 's currently at mars called the maven satellite and results from it have already shown pictures very it 's escaping off into space and this helps us confirm ideas like why mars is red from that lost hydrogen isn 't the only gas that 's lost i mentioned helium on earth and some oxygen and nitrogen and from maven we can also look at the oxygen being lost from mars it can 't get as far as the hydrogen but it 's still escaping away from the planet you don 't see it all confined into that red circle so the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet but we can study it elsewhere so one way we actually can learn about the future is by planets so far away that we can 't see and i should just note though before i go on to so stay tuned and look out for that and these planets that we call transiting have the special feature that if you look at that star in the middle and the reason that it 's blinking is because there are planets that are going past it all the time and it 's that special orientation where the planets are blocking the light from the star that allows us to see that light blinking and by surveying the stars in the night sky for this blinking motion we are able to find planets this is how we 've now been able to detect over five thousand planets and we know there are many more out there like i mentioned so so the light drops as the planet decreases in front of the star and that 's that blinking that you saw before so not only do we detect the planets but we can look at so i mentioned looking at the earth and mars in ultraviolet light and we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere and because there 's all this lightweight gas that 's ready to escape and all this heating from the star so unlike our four hundred pounds per minute of hydrogen being lost on earth for these planets rocky and planets further away are bigger and more gaseous could you have started with something like jupiter that was actually close to the sun and get rid of all the gas in it you actually can 't end up with mercury or the earth but if you started with something smaller it 's possible that enough gas would have gotten away that it would have significantly impacted it and left you with something very different than what you with so all of this sounds sort of general and in the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot jupiter gas is going to stream off from the earth and so what can look forward to or at least prepare for is the fact that in the far future the earth is going to look more like mars our hydrogen it 's not for a few there 's some time to prepare but as we learn about mars or exoplanets we find things like atmospheric escape thank you"
