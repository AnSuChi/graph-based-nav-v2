  "transcript": "in recent years millions of people around the world have come to believe that there 's something sinister about genetic modification first let me introduce my husband raoul he 's an organic farmer on his farm he plants a variety of different crops imagine some of the reactions we get an organic farmer and a plant geneticist can you agree on anything well we can and it 's not difficult because we have the same goal i believe this is the greatest challenge genetic modification is not new virtually everything we eat let me give you a few examples on the left is an image of the ancient ancestor of modern corn you see a single roll of grain that 's covered in a hard now take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana so beautiful breeders have used like mixing two different species together using a process called grafting to create this variety that 's half tomato which induces uncharacterized mutations into the rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies was developed using this approach i want to give you a couple examples from my own work which is a staple food for more than half the world 's people each year forty percent of the potential is lost to pest and disease this approach has been used for nearly one hundred years yet when i started graduate school no one knew what these genes were it wasn 't until the in my laboratory we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious bacterial disease in asia and africa we found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety that 's normally susceptible and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here are highly resistant to he said seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice although rice grows well in standing flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic as the climate changes he told me that his graduate student kenong xu and himself were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing it could withstand two weeks of complete submergence he asked i said yes i was very excited because i knew if we were successful we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice even when their fields were flooded kenong spent ten years looking for this gene then one day he said come look at this experiment you 've got to see it i went to the greenhouse and i saw that the conventional variety that was flooded for eighteen days had died but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered with a new gene we had discovered called sub1 was alive kenong and i were amazed and excited that a single gene could have this dramatic effect but this is just a greenhouse experiment would this work in the field breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the sub1 gene using another genetic technique called precision breeding on the left you can see the but then the field is flooded for seventeen days in fact it produces three and a half times more grain than the conventional variety i love this video because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers last year with the help of the bill and melinda gates foundation three and a half million farmers grew sub1 rice thank you many people don 't mind genetic modification when it comes to moving rice genes around rice genes in rice plants or even but when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria and putting them into plants a lot of people say yuck why would you do that the reason is that sometimes it 's the cheapest safest and most effective technology look at this papaya ringspot virus this virus nearly wiped out the entire production of papaya on the island of oahu in hawaii but then he took a snippet of viral dna and he inserted it into the papaya now take a look at his field trial you can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center it 's immune to infection ' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry eighty percent of hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered but consider this the genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus if you bite into an organic or conventional papaya the brown you see is frass what comes out the back end of the insect to control this serious pest bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides but we know that some insecticides are very harmful when farmers and their families cannot afford proper protection like these children cornell and bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach organic farmers like my husband raoul spray an insecticide called b t which is based on a bacteria but this approach does not work well in bangladesh that 's because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find they 're expensive and they don 't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants in the genetic approach scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria and insert it directly into the eggplant genome almost down to now i 've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used to fight pests and disease and to reduce the amount of insecticides my final example is an example where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition in less developed countries five hundred thousand children go blind every year because of lack of vitamin a more than half will die for this reason scientists supported by the rockefeller foundation researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day but golden rice is virulently opposed by activists who are against genetic modification just last year activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the philippines i wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more than a scientific research project that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed to save their sight and their lives some of my friends and family still worry how do you know genes in the food are safe to eat i explained the genetic engineering the process of moving genes between species has been used for more than forty but i say look i 'm not asking you to believe me science is not a belief system let 's look at the evidence after twenty years of careful study and rigorous peer review by thousands of independent scientists every major scientific organization in the world has concluded that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat and that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification these are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific issues such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines raoul and i believe that instead of worrying about the genes in our food we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy we must ask we must try to minimize environmental degradation the poorest people who most need the technology may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices of those who have enough to eat let 's celebrate scientific innovation and use it it 's our responsibility to do everything we can to help nature is this incredibly complex machine if we put out these brand new genes that and they started mixing up with the rest of what 's going on especially when you add in the commercial incentive that some companies have to put them out there the fear is that those incentives mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds and even if it was that there would be unintended consequences how do we know that there isn 't a big risk of some unintended consequence do lead to big unintended consequences and chain reactions pamela ronald okay so on the commercial aspects one thing that 's really important to understand is that in the developed world it 's different in the less developed world farmers there cannot afford the seed these seeds are not being sold these seeds are being distributed freely through traditional kinds of certification so it is very important in less developed countries that the seed be freely available ca wouldn 't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy this is the heroin strategy the stuff and people have no choice but to be hooked on these seeds forever pr there are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure but it doesn 't work that way for example the seed that 's being distributed the flood tolerant rice this is distributed freely through indian and bangladeshi seed certification agencies so there 's no commercial interest at all the golden rice was developed through support of the rockefeller foundation again it 's being freely distributed there are no commercial profits this situation and now to address your other question about well mixing genes aren 't there some unintended consequences absolutely every time we do something different there 's an unintended consequence mutagenesis using radiation chemical mutagenesis this induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations and so it 's really important not to use the term gmo because it 's scientifically meaningless i feel it 's very important to talk about a specific crop and a specific product and think about the needs of the and to tinker with it and i think you 're saying that that that whole model just misunderstands how nature is nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes that have been happening all the time anyway pr that 's absolutely true and there 's no such thing as pure food i mean you could not spray eggplant with but then you 'd be stuck eating frass so there 's no purity there"
