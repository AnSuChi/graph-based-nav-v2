  "transcript": "and i 'm talking about the very end i 'm talking about dying we all think a lot about how to live well what i know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two jim and shirley modini spent their sixty eight years of marriage living off in the mountains of sonoma county they kept just enough livestock to make ends meet i met jim and shirley in their 80s they were both only children who chose not to have kids as we became friends i became their trustee and their medical advocate but more importantly infections neurological illness it 's true what we found is that with a plan and the right people quality of life can remain and during this time jim and shirley chose acr nature preserves it might be your intuition dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different in both cases last days are about quiet reassurance jim died first he was conscious until the very end but on his last day he couldn 't talk through his eyes we knew when he needed to hear again it is all set jim we 're going to take care of shirley right here at the ranch and acr 's going to take care of your wildlife forever it starts with a plan saying we 'd like to die at home is not a plan a lot of people say if i get like that just shoot me this is not a plan either this is illegal laughter a plan involves you will need advocates and you want someone who can work with people under the pressure of an ever changing situation prepare a one page summary of your medical history medications put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards your power of attorney and your do not resuscitate order have advocates keep a set in their car tape a set to your refrigerator when you show up in the e r with this packet your admission is streamlined in a material way you 're going to need to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice we went through a number of not quite right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by marsha who won 't let you win at bingo just because you 're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can 't get out there what do you want to hear at the very end and from whom would you like to hear it in my experience you 'll want to hear that whatever you 're worried about is going to be fine when you believe it 's okay to let go you will so this is a topic that normally inspires what i 've learned here are jim and shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch here 's jim just a few weeks before he died and here 's shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day 's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the modini ranch and by sharing their story with you i hope to increase our chances of doing the same"
