  "transcript": "please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person let 's see i 'd say about three or four percent i had no idea there were so many believers at a ted conference why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way shape or form my talk today is about the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings we talk about being uplifted or elevated so here 's the metaphor i 'm offering today think about the mind as being like a house with many but sometimes it 's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase we climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness in one thousand nine hundred and two the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience he collected all kinds of case studies he quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences one of the most exciting to me is this young man stephen bradley had an encounter he thought with jesus in one thousand eight hundred and twenty and here 's what bradley said about for about one second in the room with arms extended appearing to say to me come the next day i rejoiced with trembling my happiness was so great that i said i wanted to die previous to this time i was very selfish and self righteous but now i desired the welfare of all mankind and could with a feeling heart forgive my worst enemies jh so note how bradley 's petty moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase and on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving the world 's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase some shut down the self using meditation others use psychedelic drugs this is from a from a 16th century aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god but here 's the weirdest place of all war and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray gray was a soldier in the american army in world war ii and after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle here 's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase glenn gray many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives i passes insensibly into a i believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom i gave up my life and it feels good it feels really good in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives it feels somehow uplifting this idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great french sociologist emile durkheim durkheim even the lower level he called the level of the profane now profane is the opposite of sacred it just means ordinary or common and individuals unite into a team a movement or a nation which is far more than the sum of its parts durkheim called this level the level of the sacred and once people circle around some sacred object or value 'll then work as a team and fight to defend it durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of of e pluribus unum of making a group out of out of individuals think of the collective joy in britain on the day world war ii ended think of the collective anger in tahrir square which brought down a dictator and think of the collective grief in the united states that we all felt that brought so let me summarize where we are i 'm saying that the capacity for self transcendence is just a basic part of being human i 'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind i 'm saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred when we climb that staircase self interest fades away we become just much less so here 's the million dollar question for social scientists like me is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design is it a product of natural selection like our hands or is it a bug a mistake in the system argue that religion is a set of memes sort of parasitic memes that get inside our minds and make us do all how could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self interest well let me show you in the descent of charles darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality where did it come from why do we have it but they 're of great use to our groups he wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in in contact and competition he said if the one tribe included a great number of courageous sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other and without coherence nothing can be effected charles darwin especially after 's book comes out in april making a very strong case that we and several other species are products of group selection but really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection so look at it this way within this team there 's competition there are guys competing with each other the slowest but while that competition is going on within the boat they can only win if they all pull together as a team i mean these things sound trite but they are deep evolutionary truths the main argument against group selection has always been sure it would be nice to have a group of cooperators but as soon as you have a group of cooperators they 're just going to get taken over by individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others let me illustrate this for you well that 's great they graze they defend each other they work together generate wealth and when they 've doubled in size you 'll see them split and that 's how they reproduce and the population grows but suppose and so when a green interacts with a blue you and in short order the cooperators are done for the free riders have taken over if a group cannot solve the free rider problem but there are it 's not that hard a problem in fact nature has solved it many many times and nature 's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own dna totally separate from the from the dna in the it 's because they used to be separate free living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism somehow or other maybe one swallowed another we 'll never know exactly why but once they got a membrane around them they were all in the same membrane now all the division of labor all the greatness created by cooperation stays locked inside the membrane and we 've got a superorganism and now let 's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free riders of defectors of cheaters and look what happens it 's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens from the defectors the cheaters and pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new what i 've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history but now there 's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different one time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria it happened again about one hundred and twenty or a one hundred and forty million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple primitive nests or hives once several wasps were all together in the same hive they had no choice but to cooperate because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives and the most cohesive hives won just as darwin said and it happened again even more spectacularly in the last half million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures they began painting their bodies they spoke their own dialects and eventually they worshiped their own gods once they were all in the same tribe they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside and they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet which is human cooperation a force for construction and destruction of course human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives but they tend to then break apart we 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are in fact often as we 've seen happen nonetheless when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement they can move mountains look at the people in these photos i 've been showing you do you think they 're there pursuing their self interest or are they pursuing communal interest which requires them to and now i 'm going to give the whole talk over again in three minutes in a more one of the most common is climbing the secret staircase the staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary or deeply interconnected we are homo duplex as durkheim explained as darwin i mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others circle around sacred objects people and ideas this is why politics is so tribal politics is partly profane it 's partly about self interest it 's about the eternal struggle between good and most importantly if the staircase is real it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life because human beings are to some extent hivish creatures like bees we 're bees we busted out of the hive during the enlightenment we broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the but sometimes we wonder is this all there is what should i do with my life what 's missing but modern secular society was built to satisfy it 's really comfortable down here on the lower level come have a seat in my home entertainment center one great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top i see this desire in my students at the university of virginia they all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into they 're all searching for their staircase and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger and this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly four hundred years ago no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main"
