  "transcript": "i come from and i grew up with a family of great seattlites because i always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as i saw fit and in point of fact i took a a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind when i was nineteen i dropped out of college dropped out kicked out splitting hairs and i went on the road i played chamber music all over the united states and europe and i toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named charlie bird and by the end of my 20s i wound up as a member of the barcelona symphony orchestra what a great life and you know my parents never complained they supported me all the way through it he 's taking a gap decade and there was however one awkward conversation about my lifestyle that i want to tell you about i was twenty seven and i was cooking dinner with my mother and what 's on your mind and she said your dad and i are really worried about you and she said i want you to be completely honest with me but and they had detected it and it was causing some confusion you see i had become see when i was a kid growing up in seattle i remember but that 's of course not real poverty that 's not even close and poverty it was a picture in the national geographic magazine of a kid who was my age and there were flies on his face and a distended belly and i was helpless some of you remember that well that vision kind of haunted me as i grew up and i and i went to school and i dropped out and dropped in and and so i started to study even though i wasn 't in college i was looking for the answer what happened to the world 's poorest people and i want to share it with you see most americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children since they saw that vision if you ask americans has poverty gotten worse or better around seventy percent will say that hunger has gotten worse since the early 1970s but here 's the truth here 's the epiphany that i had that changed my thinking from one thousand nine hundred and seventy until today the percentage of the world 's population living on a dollar a day or less obviously adjusted for inflation that percentage has declined eighty percent and it happened in our lifetimes so when i learned this i asked what did that what made it possible because if you don 't know why i wanted the best answer from mainstream economists right and center and here it is here are the reasons there are five reasons number it was i 'm not naive and i know that free enterprise isn 't everything we need and that 's beyond politics here 's what i learned is not just about accumulation at its best it 's about aspiration which is what so many people on this stage talk about is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system and we 've got to share it with more people now i want to tell you about a second epiphany that 's related to that first one that i think can bring us not just around the world but right here at home the best quote i 've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that i 've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows free markets have created more wealth than any system in history they have lifted billions out of poverty it sounds like milton friedman or ronald reagan and i said hallelujah but more than that i said what an opportunity you know what i was thinking it was at an event that we were doing on the subject at georgetown university in may of two what it 's coming together around these ideas liberals and conservatives to help people who need us the most it 's risen to to critical an article last year in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the west and it was an article in two thousand and fourteen on political motive asymmetry what 's that that 's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents ' ideology is based in hate it 's common in what the authors of this article found was that in america today a majority of republicans and democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry a majority of people in our country today who are think about it most people are walking around saying you know my ideology is based on basic benevolence i want to help people but the other guys they 're evil and out to get me you can 't progress as a society when you have this kind of asymmetry it 's impossible let 's not minimize the differences that would be really nave there 's a lot of good research on this a veteran of the ted stage is my friend jonathan haidt he 's a psychology professor at new york university he does work on the has shown that liberals care about poverty fifty nine percent more than they care about economic liberty that is diversity in which lies our strength remember what pulled accompanied by the method there 's no other way hmm how are we going to get that it 's a tricky thing absolutely phenomenal but you know what we really need we need a new day in flexible you ever feel kinda conventional do you ever feel like you 're always listening to people who agree with you because when we talk in this country about economics on the right conservatives you 're always talking about taxes and regulations and big government and on the left now we need to come together around the best ways to mitigate poverty using the best tools at our disposal and that comes only when conservatives recognize that they need liberals and their obsession with poverty and liberals need conservatives and their obsession how are we going to do it it 's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree it 's not good enough we have to remember that we need people who disagree with us because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting what are you going to do how are you going to express that where does this start it starts here this room we 're blessed we 're blessed with people who listen to us we 're blessed with prosperity we 're blessed with leadership when people hear us with the kind of unpredictable ideology number two i 'm asking you and i 'm asking me if you 're a conservative be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and if you 're a liberal be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we 've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future that 's what we get and the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we 're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas and then maybe just maybe we 'll all realize that our big differences aren 't really that big after all thank you"
