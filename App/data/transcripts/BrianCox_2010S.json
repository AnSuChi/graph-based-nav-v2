  "transcript": "and one of the first victims of difficult economic times i think is public spending of any kind but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science and particularly so i want to try and convince you in about fifteen minutes that that 's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do but i think to set the scene i want to show the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst ted slide in the history of ted but it is a bit of a mess but actually it 's not my fault it 's from the guardian newspaper i should tell you how much it costs so this is a game called spot the science budgets this is the u k government spend you see there it 's about six hundred and twenty billion a year 's a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs and it 's one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob it 's about three point three billion pounds per year out of six hundred and twenty billion that funds everything in the u k from medical research space exploration so that 's what we 're arguing about that percentage by the way is about the same in the u s and germany and france so that 's what we 're arguing about the first thing i want to say and this is straight from wonders of the solar system is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful this is a picture that actually was sent back by the cassini space probe around saturn after we 'd finished filming wonders of the solar system so it isn 't in the series it 's of the moon enceladus what 's fascinating and beautiful this an unprocessed picture by the way i should say it 's black and white straight from saturnian orbit what 's beautiful is you can probably see on the limb there some faint sort of wisps of almost smoke this is how we visualize that in wonders of the solar system it 's a beautiful graphic what we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains wherever we find liquid water we find life so to find strong evidence of liquid pools of liquid beneath the surface of a moon seven hundred and fifty million miles away from the earth is really well let me just say that was a graphic i just want to show this picture that 's one more and again we had to fly to the jovian system to get any sense that this this moon as most moons was anything other than a dead ball of rock it 's actually an ice moon what you 're looking at is the the surface of the moon europa which is a thick sheet of ice probably a hundred kilometers thick and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around so below the ice that we know of tremendous and beautiful discovery our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful it may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask which is are we alone in the universe well when i was about eight months old it was taken by apollo eight as it went around the back of the moon earthrise from apollo eight a famous picture many people have said that it 's the picture that saved one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight which was a turbulent year the student riots in paris the height of the and al gore has said it many times actually on the stage at ted because for the first time we saw our world not as but as a very small fragile looking world just hanging against the blackness what 's also not often said about the space exploration about the apollo program is the economic contribution it made i mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness the economic impact of apollo the biggest one was in one thousand nine hundred and seventy five by chase so the apollo program paid for itself in inspiration in engineering achievement and i think in inspiring young scientists and engineers fourteen times over many observers looked at the light given off from atoms and they saw strange pictures like this what you 're seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn 't just glow like a like a white light it just emits light at particular colors a red one a light blue one some dark blue ones now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that 's explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them and the electrons and so the fact that atoms when you heat them up only emit light at very specific colors was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory the theory of the structure of atoms i just wanted to show this picture because this is and again they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down jump up and fall down but look at the number of black lines in that spectrum and the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element and that 's why helium 's called helium it 's called helios but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon for example so without that understanding of the structure of atoms which led to this rather esoteric theory quantum mechanics then we wouldn 't have transistors we wouldn 't have silicon chips we wouldn 't have pretty much the basis of our modern one more i think wonderful twist to that tale in wonders of the solar system we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal it 's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature incredible prediction this is the picture of a galaxy a common our garden galaxy with what one hundred billion stars like our sun in it it 's just one of so one of our neighboring but that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy and it 's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it that 's a type ia supernova explosion now that 's an incredible phenomena because it 's a star that sits there it 's called a and what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star until it gets to this limit called the chandrasekhar limit but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe in fact that one is a carbon oxygen dwarf now there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang and there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars it was made in stars like that locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions this is a beautiful quote that i found we 're talking about serendipity there from alexander fleming when i woke up just after dawn on september twenty eight one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight i certainly didn 't plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world 's first antibiotic and they certainly didn 't intend to so i think science can be serendipity is important it can be i think finally this is a spectacular picture now it doesn 't look like our home planet it looks like saturn because of course it is it was taken by the cassini space probe but in fact it 's a picture of earth it was a picture of earth captured which is called the voyager spacecraft and that 's a picture of me in front of it for scale the uranus and neptune and after it visited all four of those carl sagan who 's one of my and it took this picture of earth but earth is suspended in that red shaft of light that 's earth from four billion miles away and i 'd like to read you what sagan wrote about it just to to finish because i cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken that 's here that 's home that 's us everyone you 've ever heard of the aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines every every creator and destroyer of civilization every supreme leader every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam it 's been said that astronomy 's a humbling and character building experience there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another the only home we 've ever the 1890s you wouldn 't have the transistor 19th century just exploit it just build things he said this he said nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind and that there are no new worlds to conquer"
