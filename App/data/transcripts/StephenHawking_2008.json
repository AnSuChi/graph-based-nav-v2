  "transcript": "the questions i would like to talk about are where did we come from how did the universe come into being is there alien life out there up until the everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging distant galaxies were moving away from us this was the big bang the beginning of the universe why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did we used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts first there were the laws like maxwell 's equations and general relativity given its state over all of space at one time but until recently under extreme conditions general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space this removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state the universe can spontaneously create itself out of we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states maybe we i now turn to the second big question we believe that life arose spontaneously on the earth so it must be possible for life but we don 't know how life first appeared we have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing the first is that we have fossils of algae from three point five billion years ago the earth was formed four point six billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years so life appeared on earth within half a billion years of it being possible which is short compared to the if it was very low one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available on the other we don 't seem to have been visited by aliens if there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring it seems to have been a singularly we haven 't heard any alien television quiz shows issuing an insurance policy we should make sure we survive and but we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill let alone the next thousand or million our only chance of but to spread out into space our future is in space that is why i am in favor of manned or should i say personned space flight all of my life i have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions i have been very lucky that my disability has not been a it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge the ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress if you had to guess either way do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher this answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for ted otherwise we would have heard radio waves the alternative is that civilizations thank you very much indeed"
