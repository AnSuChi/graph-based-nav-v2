  "transcript": "and i want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories and the idea was that individual citizens with with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques so this is a pattern that assumes we 're all in this together because now that media is increasingly social and so we 're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation and moving from one spot to another that is a huge transformation not to put too fine a point on it the moment we 're living through the moment our historical generation is living through is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history now that 's a big going to try to back it up there are only four periods in the last five hundred years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label revolution oil based inks that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside down starting in the middle of the 1400s there was innovation in two way communication conversational media about one hundred and fifty years ago there was a revolution in recorded media other than print first photos the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air radio and television this is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century this is what those of us of a certain age grew up with and are used to the media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups and the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations if you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person if you want to address a group you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group whether that was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century and this is what changed this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is bill cheswick 's map of the internet he traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them the internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time whereas the phone gave us the one to one pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the one to many pattern the internet gives us the many to many pattern that 's one of the big changes the second big change is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for meaning that phone calls migrate to the internet magazines migrate to the internet movies migrate to the internet and that means that every medium is right next door to every other put another way media is increasingly less just a source of information and it is and the third big change is that members of the former audience as dan gilmore calls them can now also be producers and not consumers every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment computers let you consume and produce it 's as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free it 's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons that is a huge change in the media landscape we 're used to and it 's not just internet or no internet it 's still changing massive destruction in a wide area as the richter scale has it and the earthquake was reported as it was happening they were taking photos of buildings they were taking videos of buildings shaking they were uploading it to qq china 's largest internet service they were twittering it chinese students coming coming elsewhere and going to school or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in were people listening all over the world hearing this news the bbc got their first wind of the chinese quake from twitter twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the us geological survey had anything up online for anybody to read the last time china had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had rather than seeing these pictures go up online and this stuff rippled like wildfire for a while there the top ten most clicked links on twitter the global short messaging service nine of the top ten pointing people to news sources pointing people to the us geological survey the 10th one was kittens on a treadmill but that 's the internet for you but nine of the ten and within half a day donation sites decided and there was an incredible picture you may have seen in on the front page of the new york times a local official literally prostrated himself in the street essentially to say we will do anything to placate you just please stop protesting in public but these are people who have been radicalized because thanks to the one child policy they have lost everyone in their next generation someone who has seen the death of a single child and so the protest kept going and finally that was enough of and so they began to arrest the protesters they began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on china is probably the most successful manager of internet censorship using something that is widely described as the great firewall of china and the great firewall of china is a set of observation points it mostly comes in from the outside world and because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it because not one of those four things was true in this environment produced locally it was produced by amateurs it was produced quickly and it was produced at such an incredible abundance and so now the chinese government who for a dozen years has quite successfully filtered the web is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can 't deal with it any other way and because there was no way to filter it other than that they had to turn the spigot entirely off now these changes don they also affect people who want to send messages because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole not just a particular strategy the classic media problem bundle up the message send the same message to everybody relatively sparse number of producers very expensive to do so there is not a lot of competition this is how you reach people ubiquitous now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world to the distributed distributed collection of the audience are now used to this change the audience can talk back but that 's not the really crazy change that we 're living in the middle of the really crazy change is here it 's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other meaning that the network when it grows large grows as recently at last decade most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals it is the green lines now that are the source of the free content which brings me to we saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the obama campaign and i don 't mean most imaginative in politics i mean most imaginative use ever and one of the things obama did was they famously the obama campaign did was they famously put up an incredible conversation sprung up there and then this time last year obama announced that he was going to change his vote on fisa the foreign intelligence surveillance act he had said in january that he would not sign a bill that granted immunity for possibly warrantless spying on american persons by the summer in the middle of the general campaign he said i 've thought about the issue more i 've changed my mind i 'm going to vote for this bill and many of his own supporters on his own site went very it was senator obama when they created it they changed the name later please get fisa right days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on mybo com within weeks of its being created it was the largest group i understand where you are coming from but having considered it all i 'm still going to vote the way i 'm going to and i 'm going to take my lumps on this one this didn 't please anybody but then a funny thing happened in the conversation people in that group realized nobody in the obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join to deny its existence to delete it to take and that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media media the media landscape that we knew as familiar as it was as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs is increasingly slipping away ubiquitous and cheap in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants in that world media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals it is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups even though it means changing the way we 've always done it thank you very much"
