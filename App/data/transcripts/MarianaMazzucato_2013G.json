  "transcript": "have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies the really cool companies the innovative ones the creative new economy type companies google facebook are coming out usually when i say this someone says it has not had the impact that these other companies have had and i work with policymakers especially in the european commission but recently also in interesting places like china and i can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues where are the european googles and what is interesting is that often but the idea is that somehow behind places like silicon valley the secret have been different types of market making mechanisms the private initiative whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that 's actually able to provide that high risk finance to these innovative companies the gazelles as we often call them which or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions especially nowadays and the discourse the images the actual words so we often are presented they are more dynamic think of steve jobs ' really inspirational speech to the two thousand and five graduating class at stanford where he said to be innovative you 've got it might be more equitable we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the u s but the problem is it 's a bit too big and it hasn 't actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could and even really respectable newspapers some they 're very explicit in these editorials they say you know the state it 's necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution but you know what what is the next big revolution going to be after the internet we all hope it might be something green or all of this nanotech stuff and in order for that stuff to happen this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution they say the state just stick to the basics right fund the infrastructure fund the schools leave the rest to the revolutionaries those they 're often called garage tinkerers because some of them actually did some things in garages even though that 's partly a myth and so what i want to do with you in oh god only ten minutes is to really think again this juxtaposition because it actually has massive massive implications beyond innovation policy which just happens to be the the area that i often talk with with policymakers it has huge implications even with this whole notion that we have on where when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which of course as we know are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition right i mean the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum so these kind of words are constantly these juxtapositions come up everywhere not just with innovation policy who actually funded the really cool revolutionary and they 're all and the point is the internet was funded by darpa u s department of defense gps was funded by the military 's the touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the cia and the nsf to two now you might be thinking well she 's just said the word ' defense ' and ' military in quite some depth is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non revolutionary bits so the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs and it turns out that a full seventy five percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring kafka ian public sector labs they spend on the marketing part they spend on the d part of r & d they spend an awful lot on buying back their stock which is & d but that 's a whole different ted talk which one day i 'd be fascinated to tell you about it was actually shaping which again is a typical public good it was even god forbid being a venture capitalist so who 's actually funding the hard stuff of course it 's not just the state the private sector does a lot but the narrative that we 've always been told is the state is important for the basics not really providing that sort of high risk revolutionary thinking out of the box in all these sectors from funding the internet to doing because the word itself nanotechnology came from within and so there 's huge implications of this first of all of course i 'm not someone this old fashioned person market versus state what we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public private partnerships but the point is by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually pffff a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of leviathan i think we 've actually really even the words that we often use to justify the p part the public part well they 're both p 's and there 's many more which myself and other colleagues have been looking at is doing much more than de risking it 's kind of been taking on that risk bring it actually been the one thinking out of the box but also i 'm sure you all have had experience with local regional national governments and you 're kind of like you know what that kafka ian bureaucrat i 've met him that whole juxtaposition thing it 's kind of there well there 's a self fulfilling prophecy by talking about the state as kind of irrelevant boring it 's sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way so what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations darpa that funded the internet and siri you will fail when you innovative one out of ten experiments has any and they 're able to actually fund the other losses from that one success and this brings me actually probably to the biggest and this has huge and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk we all know if you 've ever taken a finance course the first thing you 're taught is sort of the risk reward relationship and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait to actually invest in stocks because they 're higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds that whole risk reward thing well where 's the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the internet the internet was crazy now we don 't even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this and the problem is that economists often think well there is a reward back to the state it 's tax you know the companies will pay tax the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will will come back to the state through the tax mechanism well unfortunately that 's not true okay globalization and that 's fine we shouldn 't be nationalistic let the jobs go where they have to go perhaps i mean one can take a position on that but also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state apple 's a great example they even got the first well not the first but five hundred thousand as well as as i said before all the technologies and yet we know they legally as many other companies pay very little tax back so what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be mechanism that 's much more direct than tax why not it could happen perhaps through equity by the way in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically countries like finland in scandinavia but also in china and brazil they 're retaining equity in these in finland which then funded the next round of nokias the brazilian development bank which is a $ fifty six billion program for the future on this is retaining equity so to put it provocatively had the u s government and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund you can bet that you know if even just 05 percent of the profits from what the internet produced had come back to that innovation fund there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology instead many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained perhaps even more important we heard before about the one percent the ninety nine percent who are the different players in creating value in the economy and is the state 's role has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat and i hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green because they have not thank you"
