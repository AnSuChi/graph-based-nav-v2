  "transcript": "now open your eyes what about a life but in fact he 's struggling to stay alive because he can 't regulate his own body temperature sadly twenty million babies like this are born every year around the world but the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe long term health problems the reason is because in the first month of a baby 's life its only job is to grow resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes to heart disease to low i q imagine many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm but traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to twenty thousand dollars so you 're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here methods that are both ineffective and unsafe i 've seen this firsthand over and over again on one of my first trips to india i met this young woman sevitha who had just given birth to a tiny premature rani she took her baby to the nearest village clinic and the doctor advised her to take rani to a city hospital but that hospital was over four hours away and sevitha didn 't have the means to get there so her baby died inspired by this story and dozens of other similar stories like this my team and i realized what was needed was a local solution that could work without electricity that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use given that the majority of births still take place in the home we needed something that was portable something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies so this is what we came up with what you see here looks nothing like an incubator it looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby you can open it up completely it 's waterproof there 's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily but the magic is in this pouch of wax thirty seven degrees celsius you can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it 's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time after which you simply reheat the pouch so you then place it into this little pocket back here and it creates a warm for the baby looks simple but we 've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities we plan to launch this product in india in two thousand and ten less than zero point one percent of the cost of a traditional incubator but the longer term social impact is a reduction in population growth this seems counterintuitive but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced population sizes also decrease because parents don 't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die we hope that the embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology simple localized affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact"
